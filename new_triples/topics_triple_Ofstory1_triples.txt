My mum had me 

My mum had at 15 years 

I grew up with single mum 

To say was understatement 

I 've 've homeless for periods of time as kid 

I was from time to time sent to other relatives 

I was sent to live 

you 're kid 

You already live in shaky unstable world 

I tried hard in school 

It was only way 

My mum dropped at 14 

My mum dropped out school 

I 'm to day 27 years now 

I saved much 

I kept up while working near time 

I graduated with class honors 

I sacrificed lot 

I trashed my social life 

I got job in my field
