I grew up relatively poor 

affluent people raise up their ilk 

kids entering into college 

Their parents push towards educational endeavors 

you feel like you do n't belong with people 

They seem much from outsider 

I Am dragging down rest of guys 

I Am dragging down rest 

I 'm just going sit here 

you grow older 

people bullshitting their ways 

you realize time goes on 

people are in same boat
