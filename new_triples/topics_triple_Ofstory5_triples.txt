I still get surprised 

I purchase non-essential items 

I experience guilt after purchase 

I purchase items within even though fully my budget 

I am solidly upper middle class 

I live in home in area 

I live on tea 

I 'll go hungry 

I live for days 

my tail tried to make 

my tail tried to make in my early 20s 

I could go to class 

I could go from 1 to 8
