I lost almost half my highschool education due to covid so getting back into school hasn’t been the easiest thing, in highschool I managed 90s in everything but I never had to pickup a book. I decided to try something different and study a 2 year 4 semester autocad degree, within the first 3 weeks i quickly realized i didn’t care for it so I switched my major to business. My actual major starts next semester and this current semester has 9 weeks left. I’m struggling at every corner even when I apply myself and try to study the material. It’s extremely demotivating when your first college semester is something that isn’t your major, I don’t care to learn any of this because I don’t want to do it. I want to drop out and continue my studies next semester or later on within business. But I don’t see a reason in sitting here learning material and putting in endless hours into something that provides me with almost nothing in return or the only good return being the discovery of something I hate. I go to a fairly cheap community college and financial aid eliminates about half of my overall 2 year tuition which is only 5,600 before aid. My parents keep telling me I’m just lazy, that I dont actually want to do anything except smoke weed and hang out with my girlfriend. Whenever i bring up the idea of a trade or anything else i’m immediately told i’m not cut out for it and that my best option is to sit here and suffer for the next 100 days. Every day is taking such a heavy toll on me just trying to manage to stay afloat everyday and getting through to the night is so difficult right now. I’m not even in classes that are that difficult, but they don’t affect my major and i’m so demotivated to be doing what i’m doing right now.

1,mutantsandwich,1663470141,/r/college/comments/xh5btb/returned_to_collegehate_major/,"Common gripe. I hate my major. I started school in 2007 at a state university got a few Gen Eds done, dropped out. Went back to community college..did some more Gen Eds…dropped out after two semesters. Almost all my credits are English/humanities/social science credits. 
I got interested in exercise science/kinesiology after starting to powerlift a year and half ago. So I always wanted to finish a degree just to get out of the warehousing/factory runaround so I enrolled back into community college with the tuition reimbursement program from my work which expanded to cover any degree up to $5k in a semester. I picked exercise science (A.S.) and was planning on transferring to get a BS in Kinesiology &amp; hopefully go into physical therapy or athletics. I absolutely hate it. I also didn’t realIze that it’s a degree that most people just get and then go to med school or just end up with a useless degree. I don’t know why I thought I’d be engaged and understand it. Instead I’m struggling every minute with nutrition and bio. Just looking at texts about the human anatomy makes me hate the subject. Did I make a mistake? I hate the fact that if I switch my major for next semester…these courses (if I do pass) probably won’t even transfer later on in whatever degree I pick.",college,Returned to college/hate major,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xh5btb/returned_to_collegehate_major/,1663488141.0
2,blutlm,1662483124,/r/college/comments/x7filv/dropping_out_and_working_instead/,"So I got my AA in history at a CC. Had this whole life plan to go to CC to save money and then transfer to this local private college and live at home. I would work hard and get internships and experience because that's key to finding a job in a museum (no I don't want to teach). Well, I ended up doing CC part-time and online for 3 years while working full-time to build up my savings account for my expensive private college. Over these 3 years I ended up getting really invested in my job at a pet store. I was in the real world, making money, and now that I transferred to my private college I hate it. 

It's a small liberal arts school that's all about community. There's no option for online classes. It really isn't commuter friendly because there's mandatory events to attend outside of class. It's also a lot of work since classes are 4 credits. Especially for history it's very reading and writing intensive (which my CC did nothing to prepare me for) I think I have 12 papers due this semester. Don't get me wrong, ideally, I would love this college. Small classes that are discussion based and not lecture based. I took a class like that at my cc via zoom and loved it. However, I miss the real world. 

I miss working and building my savings account. Going back to physical school feels wrong. Part of me feels like I'm being overdramatic and that i need to suck it up, but I really don't feel happy. I keep kicking myself for not taking a management position over the summer and just rolling with my AA. I would have been making close to $24 an hour, full time, with benefits. Yeah, retail kind of sucks, but it would give me the chance to work my way up and make better money. Plus, I'd just get to go home after work and live life without the worry of homework. I can save money to put towards a house one day.

I've heard horror stories of people with their MA in history struggling to get a job in the field so I've kind of given up on that idea. The only reason I'm hesitant to drop is that I heard that sometimes it's nice to just have a degree to help you find a job. I just don't know what to do. I can drop by the end of the week and get 75% tuition back, or I can finish the semester but I'm gonna be miserable. It's just a big decision. Academically I know I can handle the work and I don't want to be deemed as a college dropout, but I just want to be happy.",college,Dropping out and working instead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x7filv/dropping_out_and_working_instead/,1662501124.0

I have been performing horribly throughout my entire education and I have been just as lost as a person in general. Last year I was placed on academic probation and then in my next semester I passed 1 out of 5 courses. Yes you read that right. My education has been a mess for years and my courses have been all over the place. I feel like I'm only in university because its the ""safest"" path to getting a real job that isn't awful dead end work. I've been struggling with personal problems these last few years and have been very depressed at what the state of my life has become and where its been heading. I now am in a situation which I don't know what to do.

I have been waiting 3 weeks to speak with my academic advisor tomorrow about the remaining courses that I need and what they think my best approach would be. But now after getting this news today that I'm ineligible to receive funding I don't even know what the point is. I have been working jobs throughout my entire degree and have done part time work on weekends during the school year and full time work during the summer months.

4,SqueamishSquiggle,1661091742,/r/college/comments/wu0skr/my_uni_took_my_semester_refund_because_it_was/,"So. My uni took my semester dining dollar refund money from me after my last semester ended. I just graduated in July because I had one class left, and I had to use a big chunk of my HEERF on a meal plan. My uni refused to give me my spring dining dollars back because they put that money towards paying for summer tuition, and I needed part of HEERF to pay for a part of tuition (about $100 or so) but would have lost it entirely if I didn’t add on a $400 meal plan. 

I didn’t use that meal plan because the only food open during the summer was a singular shitty campus Chick Fil A that was only open at weird hours, anyways, and my AC broke down mid-semester. I was counting on that refund money to help recover since neither my landlord or my insurance paid for the cost of being displaced for an entire week (landlord had shitty workers that put it off, and the heat index was 105 in a place with carpet floors, no way to install a window unit, and windows that couldn’t be left open without fear of wildlife getting in the unit). I had also been in need of my unused my dining dollars in spring but couldn’t get them thanks to my scholarship being pulled from under me without warning (3.97 GPA, did all the work to keep it, found out after the fact that the office decides who gets to use it during the summer). Now my refund for this semester is also gone when I’m struggling to feed myself and pay my bills (I live off-campus).

Honestly I’m just really freaking out here. Job searching has been showing me rejection after rejection for months, my asshole abusive parents still claim me as a dependent despite not living with them and doing all my financials on my own since I left for college, and unemployment isn’t available to me because the state I’m in is stupid about it. I had to leave my last job to have wisdom tooth surgery before the teeth grew deeper into my jaw and became even harder to operate on, so I wasn’t “fired” (though I would have been if I hadn’t turned in my two weeks since it was a retail job that didn’t give a shit about worker health and had fired someone for medical reasons during my time there already. Wooo gotta love the at-will loophole 😐.) and therefore don’t qualify for unemployment.

Basically: I’m in dire straits.

Please, if anyone knows anything, tell me what I can do to get my money back. This doesn’t seem like it should be allowed to me at all. They legit have sent me HEERF money (in its entirety) at the beginning of the semester refund in the past. I don’t know how to fight this.",college,"My uni took my semester refund because it was originally from the HEERF grant, and “You didn’t use it, so you didn’t need it.” Can they do this?

5,alenamalina,1660517737,/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,"So I'm in a bit of a weird situation. Last year, my major changed its requirements about two weeks after the drop add period and I basically finished my major first semester of junior year, and finished my degree requirements last semester. But I really didn't want to graduate early at all. First off, I had really bad mental and physical health issues, and I had actually been trying to take the past two years off for that specifically but my parents did not let me. Why I listened to them I'm not sure, since I pay for college and rent myself with financial aid and multiple minimum wage jobs. This was incredibly difficult, at one point I ran out of money and couldn't afford food, and I started having daily panic attacks and a couple of strokes because of it. But also, part of me was mad at my shitty three years of college and I wanted to have a normal year. I knew this year's tuition would be covered by financial aid and scholarships so financially it wouldn't even be that bad of a decision.

Regardless, I'm going into my fourth year majoring in International Relations. When I was making decision I also thought, hey this will be cheaper and better than paying rent at home and job hunting for a field that I know I cant get a job in yet because I don't have enough experience or connections. I can work and save up for my last year and continue to network, especially since the IR field really needs connections and college was online for year and a half.

But the problem is, I... kind of hate my major. I've hated probably since about second semester sophomore year and I've been too stuck mentally to change it. I know, it's completely my fault and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions, but it still sucks. I originally wanted to get a masters in IR and work for a think tank or for the state department, or maybe work for a nonprofit. At first I actually liked the major until I started learning about the corruption in the field. Honestly idk what I expected. I went to college to learn, not to necessarily train for a job. 

Now.. I just want financial stability. After being abused and harassed at my minimum wage jobs for so long I can't stand being financially unstable and I don't want a job that pays $40k after obtaining a graduate degree. When I first went into this my parents actually promised to pay for half my tuition and rent, but because of family issues I had to start supporting myself starting sophomore year. That shit is incredibly fucking difficult on around $11-12 an hour, especially when jobs refuse to give you enough hours. I am tired of working hard for terrible pay. Basically, after going from a family that was relatively well off to struggling to survive, my priorities have shifted. I no longer want to help people for work and I'd rather do some job I tolerate and do what I enjoy outside of work, including activism and learning about politics.

I've found that the only thing I really enjoy in this major is data analysis and research. I think working with R is fun and I never understood why people were struggling with it. This past summer I did some RA work for my professor and I'm doing my own research project this semester, and I'm also working as an RA for another professor.

So I've thought about a relatively different career path as a data scientist. I like working with numbers and I feel like this will make me a livable wage. I've thought about adding an information science degree, since it'll give me the skills I need to get into this field. But I've also thought about going into grad school. Here's where I'm unsure. Should I basically get a second bachelors in information science and go into data science, or should I just whatever classes I can in programming (like for R, SQL, and python), learn the rest on my own, and apply to grad school for data science? Or, can I learn these on my own and get a job in data science with just my bachelors in IR?

In terms of cost, I have this year's tuition and living accommodations covered, but I'm not sure that I'll get aid for my fifth year. I know I can potentially get a local scholarship and maybe a few grants, an interest free loan from a local scholarship, and I know that since this isn't technically my second bachelors I can also get loans from FAFSA. I've also thought about bootcamp, but to be honest its more expensive than what I would pay for one year at my state  university.

Is it worth the time and investment? Or am I just fucking stupid",college,Adding a major senior year,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,1660535737.0
6,Vnokewckv,1659650135,/r/college/comments/wgdfor/25_f_considering_return_to_college_advice/,"Hello All! 

I last attended college in 2016/2017 as a Junior and left because I got mad at the University for dropping my degree and refusing to refund me my tuition for the classes that were specific to said degree (classes were all canceled.) Life happened and I got married, had our kiddo, moved, changed jobs, etc. and with our kiddo starting school next year I would like to start attending college online in hopes of finishing my degree! I have come to understand that I may have to start over as a freshman, but that's fine - I never took out loans, so I'm not going into this with any existing student loan debt, I don't mind having to ""Start over.""

I'm struggling to find colleges that offer ONLINE classes and degrees in Computer Science/ Linguistics degrees, which is the field that I was pursuing previously. I would like to avoid in-person classes because I work 2 full-time jobs, my spouse is a full-time student pursuing their doctorate, and with our son starting school next year I think that would just be easiest for me since my job would allow me to do classwork while I'm on the clock.

7,SearchMundane6763,1659554065,/r/college/comments/wffa80/i_returned_to_college_20_years_after_i_graduated/,"I got an associate degree straight out of high school because of the pressure to go straight to college after graduating but I didn’t have the faintest idea what I wanted to do. My dad suggested I get a general two year degree to get gen eds out of the way so I did. I have returned for a bachelor degree at nearly 40 years old and have some insight I wish I had 20 years ago. 

1. Don’t get a general associate degree. It was a huge waste of time and money. Most of the credits I got are completely useless and I still have to go for four years. The only good thing is that I can skip the basic gen ed classes so I can take fewer credit hours each semester and still finish in four years. 

2. If you don’t know what you want to do straight out of high school, wait. If you think you know but you don’t want to go right into school again, look into your expected college’s tuition rates. My school has a “tuition promise” where you keep the rate you registered at regardless of if it goes up. There’s a time cap where anyone registered before 2016 gets that rate, but that means that since I was originally registered in 2003 I get the lowest possible tuition price. So consider going for a year and starting your possible major to lock in a price. You can always withdraw and go back. 

3. While getting the generic degree was a waste, taking different classes does help you decide what you want to do. Connecting to the last suggestion, doing the first year course plan for a degree helps you decide if you want to go through with it. It’s easy to change your major. Don’t be afraid to do it. 

4. INTERACT WITH YOUR PROFESSORS! This is huge and I rarely see young students in my classes do this. I get that you’re burnt out from high school but building a rapport with a professor is a huge part of getting a good grade. Multiple classes I’ve ended the semester on the cusp of an A and my professors bumped it up because I regularly attend class, answer and ask questions, meet during office hours to talk about what I’m struggling with or what went wrong on an exam, and turning in all my assignments. They want to see you succeed but not if you’re the student who barely shows up and then asks for extra credit the last week of class. 

5. Get an internship. There are often career centers at the university that help connect you to an internship. You don’t know what you don’t like until you try it. I got an office job position for the first time in my life and I absolutely hate it. I never would have known that was not the direction for me if I hadn’t taken the chance. Just don’t bother with an internship that is unpaid. You’re worth more than that. 

6. If your university has tutors, use it. My school has a free tutoring center and it helped so much. The tutors are happy to help and can give great insight into how to approach things from a different perspective. 

7. If you can join an organization catered to your major, do it. I can go to networking events and interact with other students in my field. It’s awkward at first (especially when you’re twice everyone’s age) but it’s a big help for eventual job hunting. 

I hope this helps. I wish I could have gotten more advice when I graduated high school. There was no social media and any counselor I saw was very unhelpful and would basically push any girl into early childhood education (I’m now in engineering).

8,undertheglowing,1658556113,/r/college/comments/w5wj3a/college_advice_for_a_confused_college_senior/,"Hello everyone,

I’m struggling right now and I’m in desperate need of advice on college. I’m set to graduate next may, but I’m not sure if I’ve truly found what I want to do and I’m set to begin my masters fall of 2023.

To give some context, I graduated class of 2020 online and started college online. The pandemic truly changed everything for me, I was going to go to a state school (UF) but last minute decided to stay home and go to a local college to save money. I’m also first gen and feel as there is a lot of pressure for me to go to college. Anyway, Got a job, worked, saved money and recently just left to focus on the last year of school especially because everything thus far has been online. Last semester was the first semester that I’ve truly have been able to connect with students, professors, (also made my first couple of friends that attend my college). I came into college undecided, I had an interest in architecture but it never happened. I was undecided until my college told me I needed to declare a major, in which at the time I was taking an intro class to Urban and Regional Planning, so I decided to follow that route because I really enjoyed the material I learned in that class. I then decided to major in Urban Design (this is back when I thought it was apart of planning, but my school didn’t do a great job distinguishing the two). 

I’m currently interning for a planning design firm and I absolutely hate it. I only go there 3 times a week. First, I basically had to learn everything myself and second, I feel like a cad monkey. Staring at the computer 8 hours a day. This internship is unpaid, but I’m thankful that I’ve come to realize that design probably isn’t for me. It also made me realize how urban design is more for architect students, not planners. But my school has failed to distinguish the two.

Because my graduation is around the corner, I’ve decided it is best to change my major in Urban Planning (instead of design, since I’m not that big of a fan anymore). Both degree have the same core requirements, it’s just a couple different classes that distinguish between planning and design. The issue is, I haven’t really been exposed to the planning side, but, from what I’ve seen at my firm it doesn’t look appealing to me. It looks like a lot of paper work and being in an office literally all day. I feel stuck as if I’ve wasted all my time doing these classes and I’m still lost. I’m set to graduate next spring and My school also has a accelerated masters program for urban planning, where I can begin doing my masters my senior year of my undergraduate… Yet, I’m not sure if planning is what I want to do. Recently, I’ve been interested in learning how to code (possibly declaring a minor in computer science) and looking into GIS. Would a minor be a good idea?

I’m quite all over the place. So, to those who have been in my shoes and don’t know their next steps, what should I do? Should I deny the accelerated masters program and take a gap year to figure out what my next step are? Should I delay my graduation? I am set to graduate a year early compared to my class and I’m on a scholarship that pays 4 years of tuition, so I could technically delay my graduation and do all 4 years paid for a minor/etc. My friends and even my boyfriend seem to have everything figured out, yet, I haven’t. this is truly stressing me out.

I encourage all college students to check out this post, and if you've been to college before feel free to share some of your own insight too!

&amp;#x200B;

***\[1\] Academics- Building A Good Schedule***

* **Get familiar with the logistics of course selection**. Many colleges have specific websites or platforms used to pick classes. Each school does it a bit differently, so make sure you know what to expect.
* **Know the exact day and time you can start picking classes**. You want the best chance of getting into your classes, especially if you’re a freshman with little to no credits earned.
* **Have backups for your classes**. Since you probably have few credits earned, you might not get into all the classes you want, but you still need to take at least 12 credits per semester to remain a full-time student.
* **Use RateMyProfessors wisely**. Sometimes you must take a certain class for your major and/or the only person teaching it has bad reviews, but for gen eds and/or classes where there are multiple instructors it’s always better to choose someone with good reviews.
* **Don’t be afraid of early class times**. Dragging yourself to an 8 or 9 am might be miserable in the moment, but you may dread a night class more. If you couldn’t take a class during prime midday hours, would you rather take an early class (one starting at 8-9 am) or a late class (one starting at 5-6 pm)?
* **Map out the classes you plan to take each semester during your freshman year**. To do so, get familiar with general education requirements and the required courses for your major. Many advisors will be happy to help you with this if you ask them. However, it never hurts to double-check with an upperclassman because I’ve heard some advisors give advice that forces people to take summer/winter classes to graduate on time or stay an extra semester.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[2\] Academics- How To Succeed In Your Classes***

* **Read the syllabus**. First, you avoid wasting your professor’s time because you asked a question outlined in the syllabus. Second, you get a sense of course expectations, assignment descriptions, and due dates early on. Sure, you won’t memorize every single detail or due date by reading it once, but you can always refer to the document as needed.
* **Spend money on textbooks wisely**. Unless your class requires the use of a textbook with an access code, try to find a cheaper version of the book. Amazon is a great way to get inexpensive textbooks, especially because they often allow you to rent e-books, which tend to be cheaper than physical ones (bought or rented).
* **Don’t skip class**. Not going to class once is like a gateway drug – after that, it’s easy to justify not going whenever you’re tired or just not feeling it. The only exception is when you’re really sick and can’t focus on the lecture anyway.
* **Sit in the front during class**. This is partially an image thing, as professors think positively of students who sit up front since they tend to be more studious. Also, sitting in a spot where the professor can easily see you will make you more likely to be attentive.
* **Go to office hours whenever you’re struggling**. No matter how small your question is, it’s better to get it answered early instead of letting everything pile up right before an exam.
* **Figure out your note-taking style(s)**. Will you take notes with a pen and paper, a laptop, a tablet, or a combination? There are many factors to consider, including but not limited to:
   * Will the class involve calculations or diagrams that require pen and paper?
   * Can you handwrite quickly and neatly enough?
   * Can you type quickly enough?
   * Can you avoid the distractions of a laptop or tablet?
   * Can you afford a tablet?
* **Study your notes after each class or review the notes from all your classes at the end of each day**. Doing so reduces the stress brought on by cramming the night before, and it helps you retain information better because you’re reviewing it regularly.
* **If you have assigned textbook readings, read them after the lecture**. It’s like a review and the context from the lecture can help you understand the material better.
* **Avoid using your phone or other distractions until your work is done**. The more time you spend on distractions, the less time you have to do work. Also, even if you “only” spend 10 minutes doing something else, you end up losing more time than that because it takes time to refocus on the task at hand.
* **Start projects early**. You don’t need to complete the whole project the day it’s assigned; just work on a bit each day to start, and as the deadline gets closer increase the workload.
* **Always do the extra credit**. Even if you're doing well in the class now, there might be a tough assignment or exam later in the semester that lowers your grade.
* **Make at least one friend in your major**. That way you can study together and support each other academically. Who knows, you might even become best friends!
* **Check out academic support resources offered by the university**. Depending on the university you attend, there may be centers that provide general study tips, math help, writing help, and so on. Ask your advisor what services your college offers. They’re “free” because you pay tuition – use them!

&amp;#x200B;

***\[3\] Organization &amp; Time Management***

* **Use Google Calendar and Google Keep**. Use Google Calendar to mark times you have class, assignment due dates, and exam dates; and non-academic events like work or clubs. Use Google Keep to make a variety of to-do lists, such as daily tasks, weekly tasks, and tasks that break a big project into chunks.
* **Use a reminder app to keep track of small things you want to do**. This is great for smaller tasks that we tend to forget if they aren’t written down, such as making a phone call. I know iPhones have a designated Reminder app, and I’m sure other smartphones do too.
* **Avoid listing too many tasks to complete on a given day**. It’s better to put fewer items on your to-do list and add more, rather than add too much and get upset if you can’t get everything done.
* **Organize your computer.** Make sure you have designated folders for emails instead of letting them pile up in your inbox, make folders for each class you’re taking, and so on. Even though there isn’t physical clutter, having a disorganized computer still makes productivity difficult.
* **Find out where each class is located in advance**. Instead of scrambling to find your class in the morning, try to walk the campus the day before to ensure you know how to get to each building and room. This is especially helpful if your campus is big!
* **Get around campus efficiently**. If your dorm is far from most classes, don’t come back until the end of the day; instead, find spots to study close to your classes. This is particularly useful when the weather is bad and you want to spend as little time outside as possible. Also, even if your campus has buses, actually using one tends to be inefficient because you’ll probably spend more time waiting for it than it takes to get to your destination. Save the bus for bad weather when it’s truly a miserable experience walking to class.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[4\] Dorm Life***

* **Be a respectful roommate**. Even if you don’t do unequivocally bad things like bringing unannounced guests or turning the room into a pigsty, your habits may still annoy someone else. For example, if you like calling friends or family in the room often, some people find it distracting. Ask your roommate what they don’t like and try your best to accommodate their needs within reason.
* **It’s okay not to be best friends with your roommate as long as you get along**. In fact, it’s better not to be BFFs so you have the motivation to branch out and make new friends.
* **Always try to sort out conflicts with your roommate before escalating things to the RA**. Many roommate disagreements are minor enough to be sorted out between the roommates. By doing so, you learn how to deal with interpersonal conflict, which is an important life skill.
* **Don’t be obnoxious to your RA**. Most RAs don’t want to make your life miserable because they’re busy students and don’t have the energy to write people up. As long as you avoid doing something that’s obviously not allowed, such as having visible alcohol, they probably won’t care.
* **Don’t sit in your room all day**. It might be easy to spend time in your room whenever you don’t have class, but it prevents you from exploring all that campus has to offer. Also, your roommate may need personal space sometimes and that isn’t possible if you’re always around.
* **Do laundry when things aren’t too busy.** Laundry rooms tend to be pretty empty when most people are sleeping (early in the morning), afternoons at the start of the week (Mon, Tues), and when people are going out (Friday or Saturday night). On the other hand, afternoons at the end of the week and Sundays are generally busy. It’s also a good idea to scope out your specific laundry room to see when it’s the most or least busy. Another tip: stay in your dorm while you do laundry to catch up on homework or perhaps tidy your room since you’re already in the cleaning mindset!
* **Always take your keys and lock the door**. Do this whether you’re going to the bathroom for a few minutes or will be gone the whole day. The people on your floor may be perfectly trustworthy, but you never know for sure.
* **Decorate your room at least a little bit**. Even putting up a tapestry or some fairy lights will help make your space more cozy and relaxing.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[5\] Extracurriculars***

* **Start making connections with professors as soon as you can**. You can do so by participating in class, asking follow-up questions after class, and asking them about their research. Knowing at least 2-3 professors well can provide you with quality job references and strong recommendation letters for grad programs and/or scholarships.
* **Get involved in a professional and just-for-fun experience – at least one of each**. Professional experiences include research or a job/internship related to your major. Having this under your belt allows you to obtain valuable experiences and soft skills you can discuss in an interview. Just-for-fun experiences include clubs or intramural sports. These allow you to take a break from school while doing something enjoyable and making friends.
* **Sign up for a bunch of clubs at the start of the semester**. Join the email list for each club that sounds remotely interesting, and then you can decide whether you truly have an interest in that activity or are free when meetings are held.
* **Get a part-time job on campus**. There are many benefits to working: You have money to spend on “fun” things like going out or ordering things online, can start saving for the future, and improve your time management skills by balancing work with school. I recommend doing no more than 10-15 hours a week, though it’s possible you have such a busy schedule that you can’t work at all. As far as getting a job, most colleges have a portal with on-campus job listings – find out how to access and use it. Many students end up at a dining hall or do some type of office/administrative work. Generally speaking, dining hall jobs are easier to get but require more hard work, while office/administrative jobs are harder to get but give you some time to catch up on homework. A few tips for getting a job: If you don't get an invitation to interview within a few weeks of submitting your application and there was a contact person listed on the job description, follow up with them. Since many people don’t do that, it’ll make you stand out. Also, many colleges offer resume critiques and practice interviews that make you a better applicant, so find out how to access this help.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[6\] Social Life***

* **Don’t let your past social life set you back**. Even if you were socially awkward or disliked in high school, you now have a fresh start! There’s no way everyone can know each other, especially if it’s a big campus, meaning you won’t have the reputation you did back in your hometown. Even if you end up not clicking with someone, there are plenty of other people to meet!
* **Say yes if anyone offers to hang out**. Even if you don’t like them at first, they might end up being really nice! This is particularly important if you don’t know many people yet.
* **Be prepared for unique opportunities to make friends**. Being in the same major, class, or club are excellent ways to meet new people, but they’re not the only ones! To use a personal example, once I got locked out of my room and couldn’t text my roommate since my phone was still in there. I ended up borrowing the phone of a girl in my dorm lounge and we became friends.
* **Quality over quantity**. This saying holds true for many things in life. In this case, a few friends who’ll be there for you in times of need is better than 20 fake friends.
* **Make plans with someone at least once a week**. Whether you grab food, study, or go to an event, it’s important to have some type of regular social support. With that being said…
* **It’s perfectly okay to be alone in college**. No one will judge you for eating alone at the dining hall or walking to class by yourself. In fact, spending time alone helps find yourself and ensures you don’t rely on others for all your happiness.
* **If partying is your thing, no judgment**. Just know your limits and always go with people you trust in case something goes wrong. With that said, you don’t have to drink to have a good time!

&amp;#x200B;

***\[7\] Health &amp; Wellness***

* **Try to eat 3 balanced meals a day**. If you don’t have time for breakfast in the dining hall, at least have snacks you can eat before you head to class. For lunch, eat a meal that includes carbs (ex. rice, potatoes, pasta, bread) and veggies. For dinner, eat some carbs and veggies, plus some protein (ex. chicken, fish, beans). I know it’s tempting to just eat grilled cheese and burgers, but that should be an occasional treat rather than a daily occurrence.
* **Stay hydrated**. Drink something with every meal at the very least, and then anytime you’re thirsty. Water is best but tea, coffee, or juice is okay too. Consume sugary drinks like soda in moderation.
* **Work out when you can**. Even if it’s hard to get to the gym 5 days a week, you can still incorporate physical activity into your life in creative ways. For example, walk as much as you can, do stretches in your room, run up your dorm stairs, go on jogs around campus, take fitness classes at the gym, arrange weekend bike rides with friends, etc.
* **Make your mental health a priority**. Taking a few moments to take a deep breath, meditating, having social support on campus, and reaching out to family back home are a few ways to maintain your mental health. Learn what works for you, don’t be afraid to try new things, and get professional help if you’re seriously struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

***\[8\] Miscellaneous***

* **Be smart with your money**. Going out, ordering delivery, and buying things online is fun, but try to keep it as a reward rather than a weekly (or even more often) occurrence. Also, consider getting a credit card to start building credit, as long as you’re responsible with it and avoid debt!
* **Spend time outside**. Most college campuses are beautiful and have lovely places to study or relax outside. It really depends on the specific college you attend, but simply walking around campus for a few weeks will help you discover some of the best outdoor areas to spend time.
* **Don’t go home every weekend or call your family all the time**. College is meant to be a stepping stone to living completely alone. Make sure you can be without your family while you still have thousands of peers around you for support.
* **Find a good bathroom on campus**. When nature calls, you want the process to be as smooth as possible. Since you can’t always return to your dorm, make sure to find another bathroom that doesn’t get a ton of traffic, isn’t too far, is clean, etc. I generally go to bathrooms on higher floors in buildings toward the center of campus.
* **Tackle your fears**. Everyone is afraid of different things, but no matter what they are it’s important to face them head-on. For example, I used to hate calling on the phone, but then I got a job on campus where I had to call people regularly and my fear of the phone was greatly reduced.",college,Things I wish someone told me before I started college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vw3u15/things_i_wish_someone_told_me_before_i_started/,1657512888.0
10,marjasole,1657390121,/r/college/comments/vv7hk9/scared_and_confused_about_my_choices/,"Two years ago I began to attend this art school in Milan about 3hrs away from my hometown. After one year of researcing about it I was convinced it was the right choice for me.
I spent the whole year attending home lessons because covid. I enjoyed most of the courses and did really well on the exams getting high/top grades on each one. Only thing I didn’t like was that since there’s many students you kind of have to teach yourself things (esp practical subjects) sometimes since professors aren’t able to follow everyone so well.

Last summer I kind of had a breakdown since I just had met my current bf and finally found some balance in my life after years of struggling with mental health and was scared of having to leave everything behind to move away. I chose to take a 1 year break and found a job, you may think it’s stupid but i do not regret this decision at all since I had the opportunity to gain some money for myself.

During this year I started to look into the local university; they offer an art program more focused on design/photography compared to the other one which is more focused on manual practices. I gravitate towards both. The local uni is a lot smaller and renomated for having spaces where students can use different types of tools for creating their work for free (rare and very cool imo). Cons is the town is a lot smaller and doesn’t offer the variety of stimulations and art events Milan can, especially in the art field.
I enrolled on the admission test of the local uni a month ago and scored 3rd.
I was convinced it would be right for me so I signed up and my dad paid 700€ of tuition.

Now a month has passed and (especially after a dream I had some days ago bruh) I’m starting to wonder if I’m going to regret this in the future. Going to Milan could be a chance to change perspective and find lots of different opportunities. I’m not as scared as last year to go there and I could even live in the same building as a good friend of mine who also studies there. Of course I’m scared to tell my dad after what he did for me even though I could give him the money back thanks to my savings from last winter. I’m scared and confused and envy my peers who are happy with the choices they made.

I’ve been learning how to read, write and listen English throughout my entire life. With all my previous experience with volunteering, essays and standardized college tests in Brazil, I was able to be accepted by the Honors College of my community college. I don’t have to worry about tuition or any fees, but the college is located at a city with a high CoL. I’ll obviously major in computer science.

Now that you guys know my background, long story short: My dad is rich but my stepmother is a bitch lol. Her daughter is a fucking crack head and basically my stepmother can not help her financially, and because of this, my dad can not help me explicitly. He basically prioritizes the marriage and hasn’t been demonstrating any willingness to help me since the beginning.

My plan now is to move, get a job at night at a restaurant or something just to pay my bills, and focus in learning languages and abilities during my first semester or so that will allow me to make money programming. 

A LOT of people from the Class of 2022 have been accepted at top notch programs, like MIT. It’s such an opportunity and I really wanted to focus in improve my english and my abilities in CC, and paying my bills programming would be life changing. I don’t wanna spend 40 hours or even more struggling to survive while I could’ve been working and getting programming experience at the same time. 

Am I being naïve? Is it possible to make $2500-3000 (yes, that’s the average CoL) as a student if I learn certain things by myself? If yes, what do you guys recommend me to learn? What should i do?

15,Shoddy-Note-6199,1653189676,/r/college/comments/uv2hn5/trigger_warning_22_reasons_why_i_think_psychology/,"Originally I posted this on a New Zealand sub based on my own negative experiences studying Psychology and the dire career prospects. However I really want to warn as many people as possible about the reasons not to study this major. Of course everyone can make up their own mind about what makes a good or bad major and what they should study, but I only want to give people something to think about when making a major life decision. When people start college they are probably more focused on the next 4 years but I urge you to think carefully about what you choose to study.

Here are the reasons I think Psychology is a bad major.

1. **A Bachelor by itself is worthless**. The vast majority of Psychology graduates will be trying to enter the workforce with only a Bachelor degree. This is true for many reasons, sick of study, average GPA, limited number of places in clinical psychology graduate programmes etc. Yet there is no job that needs a Bachelor degree in Psychology, so graduates are forced to compete for generic jobs that any graduate is eligible for or even require no degree at all. Straight away they are starting their career with a limited advantage despite 4 years of investment.

According to a report by Georgetown University (*The Economic Value of College Majors*) on average a STEM major earns $76,000 annually compared to a Psychology major that earns $46,000 annually. I don't know about you but I'd prefer that extra $30,000 per year.

So that is the US, what about other countries like the UK ? Well a similar picture emerges according the a 2022 report in the *Telegraph*, psychology does relative poorly with a salary of £25k after 5 years. Compare that to higher earning degrees like engineering which pays £36k on average. Of course not everyone is interested in Engineering, but many other degres such as Economics, Computing, Business, Geography, etc will typically be paying around £30k relatively early in your career. As their career progresses the gap continues to increase.

2. **Classes aren't that relevant**. Most of the classes aren't especially relevant to real life or the job market, so anything you learnt you might as well forget because it isn't that useful. Useful knowledge, such that it exists, could just as easily be picked up by reading a few books and watching a couple of free online courses on platforms like Coursera or EdX.

3. **Unexpectedly boring**. The course might seem to be interesting at the beginning, but in my opinion it gets more boring as it progresses. 


4. **Most of the material is wrong**. Much of the material you learn in your Psych degree is questionable and probably wrong. This is due to the replication crisis in psychology and other long standing issues around poorly designed research, fake data, ""publish or perish"",  etc. Why would you want to spend so much time learning incorrect material ? By some estimates more than two thirds of published studies in Psychology are wrong. It wouldn't surprise me if the true percentage is even higher ! These aren't obscure studies either, but highly cited papers published in prestigious journals. Obviously you have a big problem when the whole discipline has such dubious foundations.


5. **Getting into a clinical PhD is very competitive**. Even if you want to become a clinical Psychologist remember the number of places are extremely limited compared to the number of applicants. Are you sure your GPA will be at the level needed ? If not then maybe don't waste your time and instead do a Bachelor that offers good employment prospects from the outset.


6. **Skills are often taught at an inferior level**. Any limited skills you might acquire such as Data Analysis are at a fraction of a level of that which would be obtained doing a degree like Statistics. So if you want real skills, acquire them by doing a better major.


7. **Tuition costs are high for a relatively worthless degree**. College tuition costs keep going up and up, if instead of doing that Psychology degree you started an entry level job with opportunities for career progression you could well be financially much better off, and have even obtained some useful job market skills. At the very least you won't be starting your life with a huge amount of college debt. Many large companies no longer require a college degree.

8. **Vaguely related careers have more relevant degrees**. Some students talk up job opportunities for Psych graduates like Marketing, HR, Sales, Public Policy etc. But if you want to work in those areas a more relevant degree would be a better choice and would put you ahead when searching for jobs.

9. **Too many other graduates with the same major**. So many students do it. Even if you do acquire a few vaguely relevant skills for the job market, there are a huge number of Psych graduates graduating at the same time. Your job application won't stand out in a sea of graduates. In the 2014–15 academic year, schools in the US awarded more than 117,000 bachelor's degrees in psychology ! By some estimates the number has climbed even further to 180,000 degrees per year.

10. **Even a PhD could be worthless**. A few students go on and do a PhD in psychology (non-clinical). This is also risky since it will need a huge investment in time and money. Relatively few jobs then require a PhD in psychology. Some grads  might become Professors, but the chances are small. Even including part-time teaching positions, they are limited in number compared to the number of PhD graduates. Also the numbers are exploding, between 2004 and 2013, the number of master's degrees awarded jumped by 54 percent and doctorates by 32 percent.

11. **Be realistic about the possibilities**. I often see students making fanciful suggestions for career paths for Psychology graduates like designing Artificial Intelligence systems for Google or Apple. Sorry but those sort of jobs are for elite graduates that have specialised in AI at Stanford, MIT etc. Not people waving a Bachelor degree from an average college.


12. **Hardly anyone cares about that research**. You are unlikely to become some sort of great scientific researcher. Most of that research you work on nobody even cares about. After it's published nobody is going to even read it. I laugh at all the useless research that gets churned out every year. Don't waste your time on stuff nobody cares about. Do something more useful to society that offers a decent living.


13. **Poor starting Salary**. Psychology ranks relatively poorly for starting salaries and lifetime earnings. Look up the data yourself if you don't believe me.


14. **Vague skills and vested interests**. Most of the skills that people talk up like ""Synthesize information from diverse sources"", ""interpret and use data"", ""communicate precisely"", ""make better decisions"" can be acquired from other courses of study with better job market outcomes. Be careful of people with a vested interest talking up the job prospects. College Professors need to maintain high enrolments in the degree in order to keep their jobs. 

15. **Listen to the Graduates, not current students**. Whenever I come across a Psychology graduate who has been in the job market a few years, they tend to wish they studied something else. A study by the Wall Street Journal in 2010 found that only 26 percent of psychology majors reported being “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their career paths.
The people that defend Psychology are often Psychology undergraduates. It's probably better to not listen to career advice from people not even in the job market and who haven't had a chance to reflect on their studies.

16. **Clinical Psychology is stressful**. Even if you eventually find some sort of clinical psychology role, those jobs often can take a long-term toll on your own mental health due to the stress of dealing with people with such complex mental health issues. Ask yourself is that something you can deal with ? I applaud the hard work done by Clinical Psychologists but it isn't a job for everyone. Be realistic about whether the career is for you.

17. **The degree is unlikely to solve your own issues**. People often enrol in a Psychology degree hoping to understand their own mental issues better (such as Anxiety, Depression, ADHD etc), however studying Psychology could make those issues worse, furthermore most undergrad courses spend limited time on clinical topics. If undergrad courses had a clinical focus, then there would be nothing left to teach at grad school. Also don't think the degree will impart deep insight into human behavior or expert communication skills, it won't. It seemed like half the Psychology faculty at my college were a little nuts, so obviously their PhD didn't help that much.

18. **Consider all the options**. Some choose to defend the degree by saying they got a reasonable job, but when considering the substantial investment that is needed to acquire a degree, don't just consider one option in isolation instead look at all the possibilities and choose the one with the highest Return on Investment.

19. **How much time are you willing to spend?**. Suppose you decide to pursue the clinical psychology route, by the time you complete all the required degrees and licenses it could be 8-12 years before you practice psychology professionally. That's a long time, and Psychology doesn't have the high incomes of other fields with long training periods like Medicine.

20. **Is there a Doctor in the House?**. Sometimes people enrol in a Psychology degree hoping to get into medicine, but other degrees are far better preparation for the academic and scientific rigours of medical school as well as making it easier to get the required score on the MCAT. Yes the MCAT does have a behavioral science component, but the parts of the test that involve Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry and so forth make up a much bigger percentage.

21. **Psychology won't make you healthier**. Taking Psychology classes doesn't seem to make people healthier, by some estimates more than 1.5 million undergraduates take introductory psychology classes each year, yet college students seem to have more mental health problems than ever. When I was at college it seemed like half the students were depressed, anxious or had other issues. Reading online forums today it's extremely common for students to be struggling with mental health issues.

22. **I don't get no respect**. I'm not a person who cares too much about what other people think, but on the other hand nobody really respects an undergraduate psychology degree. Be prepared for negative comments from friends and family. Also the perception that Psychology is an easy major can count against you when looking for jobs.


Other majors are poor choices too and Psychology is likely on a par with other humanities and liberal arts majors. But Psychology in my mind is especially bad because it attracts so many students. Collectively Universities are churning out a huge number of graduates. Add together all the time and money wasted and the cost is horrendous. There are many better choices. Life is tough and students need to invest their time and money to get the best return possible.

Some people study Psychology because nothing else interests them or they just want to study something relatively easy. Maybe they don't care about finding a job or college debt, they may even have a huge trust fund. Even if that is the case think about how you might spend the next 40+ years in the workforce and what jobs you will find meaningful as well as provide a decent income. It's easy to say you don't care about money, but once those bills start falling due, having a decent income will make life less stressful.


Yes I made the mistake of doing a Psychology degree, but no I don't claim to be *traumatised* by the experience. However my fellow graduates and I agreed it was a waste of time. After doing some dead end jobs I studied Computer Science. That has its own issues, but was a vastly better investment. I made it my mission to warn people about Psychology as best I could. Of course lots of people get offended, send me hate mail etc, but at least I know I did my best to sound the alarm. Am I saying you definitely should **NEVER** study Psychology ? No !! All I'm saying is consider your options very carefully and be realistic. Unlike a Disney movie please think about not only the possible but also the probable outcomes from those choices.

If you are determined to pursue the Psychology degree at least consider a double major where your Psychology courses can be combined with something of more market value.",college,[Trigger Warning] 22 Reasons why I think Psychology is a bad major.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/uv2hn5/trigger_warning_22_reasons_why_i_think_psychology/,1653207676.0

My family could kinda afford it but it's just becoming more and more expensive there. So I applied to an Australian university for it's Malaysian campus cuz it's cheaper than the UK. Studying in Malaysia would almost cost me half of the price of studying in the UK. For both cases my family would still sell our land in hometown. I feel extremely guilty for this, we belong from a minority tribe in our hometown actually and I feel like selling it is like losing something. 

I'm thinking like if I go to Malaysia then other half of the money could be contributed towards my little sister's education or towards my parents health if something happens to them tomorrow (healthcare is not free in my country and as they are growing older I'm worried about them too).
-&gt;UK university:-
1. Most desired course (bachelors in Biological Sciences)
2. More choices to specialise in Biology 
3. Tuition fees is $27,000 per year
4. Every year the tuition fees increases by 4%
5. Easy to find a job because of the new visa rules in the UK for foreigners. 
6. I can enter the Space Industry later there as this my ultimate goal.
7. I can get full one year of work experience
-&gt;Malaysian university:-
1. Not a desired course (bachelors in Science)
2. Very less specialization units
3. Tuition fees is $10,000 per year
4. Tuition fees barely increases every year but it can sometimes 
5. Extremely hard to find a job as a foreigner either in Malaysia or in neighbouring country like Singapore due to strict employers rules against hiring foreigners.
6. Conservative country (I already come from a conservative country so I'm not willing to move a similar country as mine)
7. Can graduate with an Australian degree for half the cost but the quality of teaching/facility is low.
8. I can only secure an internship for 2 months due to the course design.

I'm really struggling to make a decision. If I go to the UK then I think I'm being more selfish to my family but on the other hand I don't want to compromise with my dreams too.

I am completing the Gen Eds at my community college right now that are needed for the Mortuary Science Program. I am really excited to apply this fall and am 90% sure this is the career path I want to be in 😅.

However... I can only choose part-time or full-time, and either online or in-person. I could submit a letter to request to do both in-person and online... but since this industry is so hands-on and science based (which, science isn't my best subject) I would much rather prefer to do in-person.

I work at an elementary school, and even though I love working with children (I originally applied bc I thought I would go into ECE), if I did full-time school with my part-time work (29-32 hrs a week) I would go crazy. I'm already struggling this semester with 11 credits so 😭

Ultimately my preferred option is full-time so I can finish the program in a year, but I'm scared to take the leap (especially financially)! I have abt 3,000 in savings from a loan I took out but tuition w/ fees and estimated textbook costs is going to be $6,400 for the year alone.

19,False-Fisherman,1648611445,/r/college/comments/trxecn/i_just_flunked_out_of_college_how_can_i_make_a/," Hi all. I started my college career as a computer science major at the University of Utah in Fall 2020, with mostly remote classes and professors being much more lenient with grades than usual. I excelled at first, making the Dean's list my first semester, but that was mostly due to being able to put in little to no effort and still getting great grades. Fall 2021, however, my college went fully in-person and, not being prepared for the difficulty/workload to increase drastically, I struggled. I also switched my major to Math midway through the semester because I had been slowly realizing for the last year that I hated computer science and would rather pursue something I actually enjoyed.

I effectively lost my scholarship (effective Fall 2022) and ended up failing three computer science classes in one semester, so in hopes of transferring to a more affordable school, I decided to retake all my failed classes again this semester to salvage my absolutely tanked GPA. I ended up struggling again and was not going to pass a single class again, so I dropped out while I still had time to get a refund on tuition.

Right now I'm working and living on my own but I still have a dream of going back to school, this time in a major I actually care about and am good at (Math or Philosophy) and hopefully at a school that better fits me (Lewis &amp; Clark College looks perfect for me in terms of fit and has an 80% acceptance rate). **How do I make a roadmap to get into another school and finish a degree? Would an associate degree with exceptional grades be enough to overcome my disastrous grades at my old school? Should I take online courses for credit as well?

I started college right after graduating high school in 2018. I had a hard time adjusting to college while also working as I was paying out of pocket for tuition and fees. I didn’t do so well for my AS. It took me three years to get it as I failed and retook a couple of classes and didn’t know that I needed to take at least 15 credits a semester to get my AS on time. Eventually, I got it. 

Last semester, I transferred to a local four year university to get my BS in Biology. Before this, I got promoted at my job and I moved out of my parents home and live in a house with a bunch of roommates and our three dogs. I figured when I started my BS, I would have to cut a lot of my hours (to three days a week) to really focus on school and to secure a good GPA. I didn’t do poorly but not as well as I had hoped. 

This semester, I am taking harder classes so I decided to cut my hours even more (weekends only). However, despite putting more time into studying and homework, I feel like I am failing all of my classes. All I do is class and homework. Maybe the occasional gym session. Not to mention taking care of the dogs or the house. I’ve been thinking more about dropping out but I am already in so far. I even planned out the rest of my classes to graduate next year but I don’t even know if that’s possible (13 classes). 

I have such a hard time wrapping my head around how people graduate on time while partying and being involved at school. I couldn’t imagine having that kind of free time and still have a 3.8 GPA. I think it’s becoming harder as I’m watching all of my friends picking up their caps and gowns. I’m happy for them but I feel like a failure and stupid. Ideally, I’d love to go to grad school because I want to get into research.

I felt like college is really expensive (I go to a very expensive private college which no one has ever heard of). I've considered going to a cheaper one but my parents wanted me to stay here, they are paying for all my tuitions and I've always been feeling guilty for it, after seeing all my peers paying their own college fees or getting scholarship/aids (didn't manage to get any scholarship cuz 90% of schools rejected me and people said i shall be glad getting an offer). My school offers very little grants to int students, so I took an alternative option of studying in summer terms every year to save up around 1/5 of tuition, even though that barely helps and don't know if my parents would allow me to, since they barely see me anyway. 

Socially: Few friends but none of which is very closed.

My inside cries all the time knowing that I would miss the most precious time of my brother's growth and by some day he would forget me. 

Academically: I studied the IB curriculum at high school and chose the easiest classes (English B HL and Math AI SL) for points, and because I had depression + anxiety at high school so the school made me take certificate instead of diploma (choice of 90% of people), and I refused so they recommended me to take the easiest courses. Consequences: relatively high points but rejected by every other schools, struggling at every courses in college because of poor English/ math skills. Don't wanna blame anyone cuz its my own choice, but just felt angry cuz no one ever told me about the consequences.

My mom used to smack me across the face and hit me with household items. I was effected by these actions and developed depression and anxiety. I did not know I had these conditions or how they effected my learning.

I went to community college and failed classes for the first two semesters. I left that community college and went to another one in a different district. 

I started over in another community college and was struggling still, but I failed less classes. I kept going to this community college and I applied to a 4 year. I was accepted and transferred over. Then college became more difficult and I started failing again and was kicked out of the 4 year college. 

I then went back to community college and paid the out of pocket cost for tuition at the 4 year for 1 class each semester (all I could afford).

Anyone can take classes at a 4 year, but the price of tuition is different when you are not an accepted student anymore.

Eventually after taking classes at the community college and SLOWLY raising my GPA at the 4 year, I reapplied and was accepted again. 

3 semesters in I started failing classes again. One professor from that semester I was failing requested to speak to me one on one. She asked me how I studied for this past exam. I told her I cried for 3 hours on the floor and was cutting myself. 

She requested for the school to help me and I met with a psychiatrist. I was administered Lexapro, which was effective within a month. I met with the psychiatrist once a month to monitor my progress. At the 8 month mark I made a reasonable amount progress and then she weaned me off the drug.

When I was deciding colleges, I was excited about UM because I was getting paid to go to college because I had 2 scholarships. Also my tuition was free as a result of both of my parents working there (my mom retired in 2018 but my dad still works there).

However, this past fall semester was really tough and challenging. I liked it at first, but then I started to get bogged down and here’s why. I was a music major (B.M. in Music Education) and I had wanted to be a music major since the spring semester of my sophomore year of high school. I love band and playing my clarinet. But I hated music theory. It killed any interest I had in pursuing music. I got depressed (so much so that instead of practicing one day in the practice room, I went in the bathroom stall and had a crying session) and unmotivated (so much so that I just didn’t turn some stuff in) and it affected my grades.

I changed my major after that. I’m now a General Studies/Freshman Studies major this semester while I figure out which major I want to pursue (I’m leaning towards either Journalism or Political Science). I started classes this semester today, and I only have 12 hours (I think 17 hours last semester was a bit too much), so I have more time to get everything done.

While my first day back was good (I even saw a childhood friend from Oxford who transferred here from Belmont), I’m left wondering if maybe I picked not only the wrong major but the wrong college/university too. The reason I picked UM was because of the free tuition, I had a lot of friends going there, the chair of the Music Department goes to our church (and oh boy she can sing!), we have a good football coach plus the 2-year bowl ban as a result of former coach Hugh Freeze’s mishaps was lifted (we just recently went to the Sugar Bowl this year after a 10-2 regular season and finished 10-3 because we lost 21-7 to Baylor), and also the band is great. And I knew my way around the campus very well because I’ve been on campus a lot with both of my parents working there.

But I haven’t really made any new friends outside of band, and even in band I find myself struggling to fit in because it’s very cliquey (it was that way in high school too). I also want to be able to hopefully experience a Bowl Game every year of college (which is one reason why Alabama interests me) and I’m unsure about Ole Miss’s chances of going to a bowl all 4 years because Matt Corral is going to the NFL, several coaches are leaving, and rumor is Lane Kiffin’s putting his name out there or is getting job offers from other schools and even a few NFL programs.

Also I feel like some day I’ll obviously need to learn how to be independent. I’m not the clingy type, but I’m living at home because the campus is literally in our town and it saves money. Another reason why I chose UM was because since I was getting free tuition, I felt like it would be a better financial option than paying at another school especially with COVID hitting right before my junior year of high school ended and we just didn’t know how much it would affect the economy and the stock market.

But I’m just wondering is it normal to have these feelings? Sometimes I feel like I never get to escape my city as much as I want to.",college,Is it normal to want to transfer colleges?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/s7jjcr/is_it_normal_to_want_to_transfer_colleges/,1642591401.0

In the two terms leading up to my suspension, I failed every class I had for a few reasons, the main one being that I never did work in advance. Instead, I preferred to spend that time doing anything but studying/homework, such as playing video games or watching YouTube. Another reason was that I don't feel confident in my writing, so when I actually got started, I spent a huge amount of time struggling with stuff like sentence structure, or whether I'm using the right words to make my work sound ""academic"" enough. I know I messed up big time, and I'm worried about how this will affect my future.

I am currently taking a single course at a community college that involves a fair amount of writing so that I could get more practice, but even then, I'm struggling to get my work completed. Despite all this, I still enjoy learning. I find my courses and professors interesting and engaging. I was happy to do math homework, but when it comes to writing, I freeze up.

I still want to work towards a degree though, but I don't know where to go from here. The college where I was suspended from is a private college, so tuition is extremely high, and that makes me hesitant about returning. Do I try going to a community college instead? What should my next steps be? Thanks in advance.",college,"Academically suspended for a year, and haven't done anything meaningful since.

Hey, I'm a typical college student who's having trouble with deciding their major. Been in college for like 2 and a half years already and went from a criminal justice major to a psychology and now a computer science major. I'm about to hit you with a long ass story so maybe go grab a snack or somethin idk

Like a year back your boy got cheated on for the first time, it was his first relationship too so that ruined me. During that time my home girl lets say Emily helped me go through that tough time. I knew her for 7.5 years, we've been online friends for a long time and have been playing video games throughout those years very often. We got super close ever since my ex cheated on me, we then started dating. Everything was going great, I switched majors to computer science and started my prerequisite classes during the summer, I was doing fine (B- in discrete math and C- in calc 1). Me and Emily planned on meeting for the first time towards the end of October. This is where everything goes downhill, Emily cheats on me hell yeaaa this is awesome (not really). Your boy was heart broken, exams were also near, I took a massive L on my linear algebra calc 2 and intro c++ exams. I was able to complete my english essay though so that's good (taking a intensive english writing class as well). Imagine dating your best friend of 6 years for a year and a half and then have them cheat on you when you two were literally about to meet in a couple of weeks haha. Yea your boy went through the great depression. It also sucked that I had no one to talk to about it so yea I bottled it all up and I still do which probably isn't healthy. I now lack the beginning/mid information of these courses, I am NOT an math expert so catching up has been extremely hard for me, like honestly I don't think I'm catching up at all it's like I'm taking in information and spitting it back out for another piece of information. Been struggling to focus on lectures as well. I have a linear and cs exam on Tuesday which I am NOT prepared for, I'm looking at my cs/linear practice exam and oh god I can't solve any of the questions. I know I'm going to fail these two exams.

Now the big question is whether or not computer science is for me. Around the early stages of the class I really did enjoy it, it felt nice when my code worked and I did kind of liked the puzzles here and there. As the course progressed things obviously started to get harder which is normal for every college course. Its frustrating when I don't understand what's happening, I'll be trying to google up parts of the question to have myself google up a part of the googled answer, it's very frustrating. I'm not sure if it was because of the girlfriend incident that's making me want to change majors, I don't really like pure math at all but the concept of coding is really interesting to me, I do find myself enjoying it sometimes and I do feel really cool doing it haha. Obviously the incident hindered me and ruined my learning experience in CS, I'm not sure whether it is me as person not enjoying the class or if it was her that made me not enjoy the class. I don't really know how to explain it, basically I went from variables loops stuffs like that and then hopped backed in at recursions and arrays, its all very confusing right now. Maybe it was a bad idea to take 2 math class and intensive writing class on the side? (probably was, especially when im not a math talented student). Honestly I don't even know if I make sense right now, I probably sound hella dumb trying to explain my entire situation. Over the years of taking career quizzes and personality exams they all recommend me trying computer science but like I don't really enjoy it I think? Am I suppose to look forward to this class every single day? Like am I suppose to be excited to wake up at 9 am (big mistake taking it at 9 am btw im not a morning person) in the morning for this CS class? It's like I enjoy it but I don't enjoy it, my brain is so conflicted I don't know how to explain it. How do I know if it's something I'd want to do for the rest of my life? One thing I do know is that I really do want to do something tech related. I really enjoy being near computers and doing computer related activities, it's one thing that I learned about myself when taking this CS class. I was looking at maybe IT but I really don't want to transfer college again. Should I retake the course alone next semester and see how it goes? Or should I just change majors into something else, I was looking at accounting business or graphic design. I heard the math in accounting isn't that bad, I'm fine with doing basic algebra I just really hate the complex math questions where you gotta use like 500 formulas on one question that has an part a to z in it. I'm worried about what to do next but I don't really want to delay my graduation anymore, I already delayed it by a year when I switched my major, I don't want to delay it even more. I have nothing against people who graduated late, I don't know why I get this feeling but I just have this random fear of graduating late, not sure why. Another thing is I feel so bad and guilty for wasting my dad's money. He's paying for my tuition, he didn't even want to pay for it in the beginning but my mom convinced him to do it. What am I suppose to tell him if I fail this class (which I probably will, I got a 6/40 on my first CS exam yeaa I didn't do good, 45/100 linear exam and 28/100 calc 2). I'm pretty much lost right now with what I want to do with my life, this post is probably really dumb but I just wanted to put it out there and see what your thoughts are. If I said anything confusing go ahead and ask a question, I wrote this on my phone past midnight while I was crying myself to sleep so there will probably be some confusing sentences here and there. Your mentally broken home boy is extremely confused with everything and needs some guidance.

I'm a 20 year old dude enrolling in a CUNY college btw if you were curious.

Oh btw If I do pass linear algebra and calc 2 with a c- the only math class I'll have left will be probability, I was able to complete discrete math, pre calc, and calc 1. I'm just unsure whether I actually enjoy coding or not.

Was gonna post this in a cs subreddit but I do wanna see what everyone else has to say about this.

32,ViperOnThatBeat,1637004411,/r/college/comments/quo8t4/should_i_drop_out_of_college_and_redirect_my_own/,"Paying for college while broke in unusual circumstances is pushing me to drop out.

I am a college student attending a public film school. I like being here. Unfortunately I--a 2020 high school graduate--was retarted enough to jump right into university ASAP. During a pandemic. Where I felt like shit and have continued to feel like shit for three semesters straight. I love being creative, doing creative work. It brings me purpose for this world. I, however, hate feeling like shit when all I have done with my day is work and drive, work and drive, with no window of opportunity to enjoy the day, my friends, or my life outside of my own house because I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUCKING MONEY.

Here's the fried thing, right? My tuition isn't expensive by normal college standards. It's like $5.5K a semester. I have a merit scholarship that cuts it to $2.7K a semester. Here's the problem though: My step-father, who's a well-paid doctor, is refusing to pay for my education simply because in his own words ""I am not your father"". Mind you he pays for many other expenses like matinence in the wonderful house we live in and car repairs. He's easily making six figure income and jacks my EFC up for FAFSA. Oh well that fucking sucks, at least my mother might help right? No, it's not a given. Half of her time is spent being grandma and grandpa's legal guardian because they had a big mental health can of worms spill out and it's still being cleaned up. She's only able to work temp since the temple she worked at cut her off during the pandemic. Now she and I would have to scrape our savings to pay $2.7K. $2.7K!!! That's fucking ridiculous we have to pay scraps while she can only work temp and I'm dealing with full time college. I have about $1.3K and she prolly has a little over that. I don't know, she's not transparent on her end of this financial deal 😡.

So I'm thinking of dropping out, or taking a gap  year. Or two. Or many, because I just DON'T HAVE MONEY. Or *ENOUGH* MONEY. Trust me, I would love to hone my craft at my school until completion and earn my BFA. But honestly? I can't work and study at the same time, because even with one (1) (ONE!) editing comission I am taking MONTHS to complete. That and if I'm struggling with one comission I can't do school on top. School is a 37-45 hr week job. Adding a job on top will make me insane. I have friends that work in college or multiple jobs. They claim to be okay. They're bullshitting because their mental health is doodoo and I'm already medicated for current problems AS-IS by being a full time college student. Second, I don't have friends in college. Many friends rather, because three semesters during a pandemic and being poor in a rich man's house doesn't provide much opportunity for campus engagement :))))))) so that's been down the drain and I've felt like poop. 

So now I'm thinking about going back to square one. Get done with this semester, not make any college plans for the spring, and straight up see a career counselor, because if I go down this path of scraping for dollars for college with my mother, it'll end up terrible for both of us, our relationship will go to shit, and I will be left only with tools and a piece of paper in a grown-up world where I still have the emotional and directional discipline of a teenager. I won't be able to survive on my own after graduation. I'm constantly insecure that my direction in life isn't 100% my own and I fucking hate myself for that.

So what'll it be, should I press on with my studies unsure of how to pay? Or should I drop out now and stack some paper before I make any further decision? Or could I just scrape whatever I have and spend on alternative education solutions? I don't wanna call warm and hotlines over this shit anymore.",college,Should I drop out of college and redirect my own life because I can't guarantee paying for tuition?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/quo8t4/should_i_drop_out_of_college_and_redirect_my_own/,1637022411.0
33,spoodydoo,1636225309,/r/college/comments/qo6vdw/should_i_try_to_withdraw_from_this_class_or_push/,"So I’m pulling a C (75) in an Intro to PR course right now that is online asynchronous, or basically a “no class meetings, here’s the work, get it done” class. I’m taking four four-credit courses right now (16 credits) and one zero-credit course that’s needed for my degree, so technically 5 classes but 16 credits.

Now, 3/5 of those classes are online asynchronous, including the PR course that I’m struggling in. The difference is that with the other 2 asynchronous classes, the teachers always reach out and email their students weekly, announce their office hours, give multiple extra-credit opportunities, etcetera. The way the assignments are set up is clear-cut and explained thoroughly to where I always am able to understand what I’m being asked to do, and if not then my questions get cleared up through an email to the professor(s). Therefore, aside from that one PR class, my lowest grade currently otherwise is a 97. 

Now, with the PR course, I’m not at all familiar with the subject or the material, but every assignment the professor gives makes it seem as though the professor almost *expects* us to know exactly what to do every time (she has 20+ years of professional experience in the PR field, after all). I’ve tried to read the chapters but again, it’s like the book expects you to already be familiar with its topics. I can read a chapter multiple times from the readings and *still* not understand what I’m being asked to do for the assignments; I just go off of what the book shows me, but I don’t really retain any of the information afterwards. 

I’ve already met on Zoom with this teacher. She’s very nice and has been very accommodating in situations where I’ve needed assistance (such as not getting access to the book on-time, and giving me extra time to do assignments and not even counting them late). She means well, I’m sure, but I don’t think an online asynchronous format works well with the class or the way she teaches it. Plus, she teaches at a different university and has a 1-star rating with that university, and is apparently notorious for being nitpicky with grading and takes *forever* to grade assignments, so you never really know what your grade is (ex. I’ve handed in 5 assignments for her class this semester, and only gotten a grade on the *first one* that I handed in *2 months ago*). I don’t want to disappoint her, but I don’t think I’m the right fit with her teaching format. 

The fact that I can’t wrap my head around the material and how it’s being delivered is starting to burn me out with this class, and I’m considering withdrawing and retaking it in a future semester in a face-to-face format, as the class is a major component of my degree. There’s a teacher I have another online class with (and an A in) that will be teaching Intro to PR on-campus next semester, so if I could get in a class with her with a different teaching method, I think it would really benefit me. 

The 60% completion of the term is marked as being November 7th, the day my PR midterm is due. The deadline at my college to withdraw from full-term courses with a W on your transcript is the 15th, so I’m thinking of half-assedly completing the midterm, handing it in, then going to campus on the 8th or 9th and seeing if I can withdraw and retake the course face-to-face at a later date. 

Withdrawing will put me at 12 credits (from 16 attempted) which is still full-time status, so I have no idea if any aid would be affected. If I were to stick it out and try to pass the class, I would need a C *minimum*, so anything lower and I’d have to retake it anyway, plus with a major kick in the groin to my GPA. 

My questions are: 
1. Should I even do the PR midterm? 
2. Should I try to withdraw and retake the course later, or should I try to pass it and risk failing? 

I’m already 2 assignments behind in PR, too. My major worry with withdrawing from that one class is that I’d owe the school money from the financial aid that paid for it (which I don’t have). My school does flat-rate tuition though for 12-20 credits I think, so would it matter? If there’s no academic or financial consequences to withdrawing then I will literally leap to the opportunity. 

From college-student to college-students, any advice?

TL;DR: A class that is a core requirement for my degree is being taken online asynchronously, and I’m really struggling with it. Minimum grade needed to pass is a C, which I currently *just barely* have, and I’m feeling burnt out from doing a bunch of assignments *hoping* that I’m doing them correctly. I have A’s in all of my other classes. Withdrawing would take me from 16 credits down to 12, so I’d still be considered full-time. Not passing the class would be a big hit to my GPA. Either way, I’d likely have to retake the class again, and I think face-to-face for this class specifically would be better for me. I’m just worried that financial aid may be affected, or that the school would want their money back or something.

34,jacobflores1,1635953571,/r/college/comments/qlx072/miserable_at_college/,"I'm currently a college freshman at a UConn regional campus (commuting from my parent’s house) studying Finance, on track to living on the main campus (Storrs) next semester. 

Currently, I'm having my good days &amp; bad days. I work 25-30 hours per week at my job &amp; go to class 15 hours a week. Add in studying, homework, etc. and it's closer to 60 hours per week, sometimes 70 hours if I'm prepping for an exam. It's pretty grindy, and I'm mostly ok with that. I've worked these kinds of hours before. However going into college this summer, I had aspirations of getting into a top MBA graduate school after undergrad, so a 3.7+ GPA was my goal. &amp; I’ve done somewhat well academically. Granted I have 3 very easy classes with no exams that will be guaranteed A's, but my Stat class &amp; Mircoecon class I've struggled through tremendously. Between these two classes, I've had 4 exams so far and the score has been: 70%, 64%, 60%, &amp; 83%. I feel like I'm very good at doing more grindy assignments, like bs homework and essays, but prepping for exams &amp; the actual test taking is what is killing me. Now granted this winter, work will end and I'll be able to focus on school full time come next semester. But as of now, my whole life feels like misery. I wake up and immediately have a knot in my stomach about the anxiety I have for the day. College just seems so much harder than HS &amp; it's overwhelming. I could end up with a 3.6 at the end of the semester, but I could end up also with more like a 3.2 if the exam scores continue in the direction they're going. &amp; if classes get harder next semester as I predict they may, my MBA aspirations may soon dry up. 

Last night I began studying for the 3rd Mircoecon exam and I didn't get too far. This exam covers around 100 textbook pages (4 chapters), and I sat there for 90 minutes at my desk only getting to the 3rd page, really struggling to understand basic concepts. I had the worst mental breakdown I had all semester, cried for about an hour, and gave up for the night, and just laid in bed texting my mom &amp; dad venting on how frustrated I felt. At that rate, it would take me 100 hours to solely read the textbook, not even properly study for the exam. 

Everyone at the main campus I know just seems to be partying all the time, and genuinely having a fun time. But for me, I feel like it's a race for me to get all my homework and other assignments completed, so I can free up some time to study for exams. I feel like school is consuming my whole life, and it certainly is something I think about almost constantly even when I'm not working on school work (at my job). I don’t have a gf, and I almost feel guilty trying to hang out with the few friends I have, because I feel like I should be studying. So there are very few things to look forward to at the moment, definitely playing this semester on hard mode. 

I'm wondering if I should take next semester off through a leave of absence, which allows my current 14 credits to stay. &amp; I have 7 credits from HS, and taking a couple of summer classes in the future years can still allow me to graduate in 4 years despite taking the semester off. This will technically give me time off from December 17-August 30. Throughout this period would I like to pursue entrepreneurship to see if I can maybe not need college altogether if I can do well with my business. I’ve bought 3 courses, and around 50 books this summer. A mentor I know used the same courses I have when he was 19 and was able to reach $10k per month with his amazon ad agency within 3 months working 10 hour days, 6 days a week. I'm tired of school. I’m not naturally good at it, and my passion for entrepreneurship makes me wonder if the bachelor's degree qualification will even matter for my success in the end. I don't want to play the school game, where I'm at UConn till I'm 23, work for a few years, get a top MBA (if I can even get it) at 29, and then work some mindless high paying job that in all honestly would never fulfill me. College is god awful, I technically feel like I can persevere. But it sure is a challenge for me and I feel incredibly miserable and unfulfilled. I hate taking classes that don't interest me, spending all my parent’s money on my tuition, and even though I study hard and learn, my exams test me more on my memorization &amp; I do poorly no matter how much prep is done.

I was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar in December. Spring semester rolls around and I was taking harder classes. I want to go to medical school and I’m a psychology major, so I was beginning to take pre-med prerequisites including college algebra and general chemistry, all while doing an internship and upper-level psychology classes that demanded a lot of attention.

So if you were in this situation what would you do - I’m a freshman in college in a 4 year school currently working towards being a nurse - I am from the US. I have been in this set up for the first semester and I am struggling a lot with keeping up my grades and my mental health isn’t that great either. They’re very selective and competitive with who makes it into their program and I am not making the grades they want. So I had recently looked into transferring to another school. All of my ideas were up in the air but I began to look into another 4 year school that offered a free 4 year college tuition program and the nursing program was not nearly as selective as well as the required grades for the courses was something I could manage. Although the school I am at now is great and I would be sad to leave I know in the long run I wouldn’t be happy with the major I have and waste a lot of money, and I didn’t want to switch my major. 

I also want to mention I have pretty strict parents and here’s why - they mentioned going to community college for my degree if this school didn’t work out and the idea of it didn’t sound good to me being as I want my full 4 year degree and some sort of college experience. But when I had mentioned that I was considering transferring to the other 4 year college they did not take it well and threatened to cut me off financially and not have my blessing, as well as embarrassing me in a couple of scenarios and getting other people involved when it was unnecessary. The reason they gave was that the school was unsafe - and although this school was near a public city that has had some issues in the past the campus itself is safe. And the school I’m at now is also in a city but is claimed to be a safer area. So the overall issue I’m having is I’m not sure what to do from here because what I feel like would be best for me is not what I can do - I can stay here and change my major, come home and do community college, try to convince them if another school will work but it may not offer as much as this one could, or decide that I will do what’s against their wishes and go to the school I had originally considered going to.

The issue is, I told everyone I was going to school to become a dentist, I quit my job, I have 0 money, and I am struggling to figure out what to do. I called the financial aid office and they told me I would lose my funding and have to appeal if I withdrew. It would be my 2nd appeal. The first one was 10 years ago after graduating high school and dropping out of college immediately after.

I am stuck, I don’t know if I could/should continue. I do not feel like I want to become a dentist with how difficult the path seems to be. I do not want to burn the bridge at the college by withdrawing and having to appeal again for financial aid, but at the same time I feel as if I can’t continue.

I committed to it due to all the benefits I got - free tuition, free laptop, prestige, research opportunities, stipends to do research/study abroad, really good connections with professors (I'm taking classes now with professors who are well known in their spheres of work), and it's all in NYC (you can probably guess what school it is).

Heading into my second year here, all my classes are still online. Even though I live on campus, I'm struggling to find a true sense of community here (there's like 200 people in the dorms out of the 16,000 students that are here and a decent portion of the students here don't even go to my school). The dorms suck, no dining hall/meal plan, and the area of the city that I'm in is more unsafe than other areas (I hear gunshots very frequently and there's always police activity right around where I live). The school also is continuing to face budget cuts where two of my classes now are taught by 2+ teachers and one out of the two classes a week is prerecorded and asynchronous. Last year I had two classes that just switched professors halfway through the semester because the school didn't want to pay a full time teacher. Overall, if I'm not taking an honors class the classes just have not been challenging at all and they've been very boring. I'm undecided for my major and none of these classes are fostering any new interests and its driving me to the thought of just taking gap years until everything is back to a normal state. Time is flying by and I've just felt more and more animosity and depression regarding school and I still have absolutely no vision of where I see myself in the future.

The thing that's keeping me here is that I worked really hard through high school and committing to here felt like I had finally accomplished like a physical reward. I also have a fear of the unknown where even though I hate the school now, what if everything they promised does actually come back for the spring/next year. 

Do I stick around here for longer? Or do I transfer after this semester? I'm also thinking about just dropping out right now but I feel like it's a waste since I haven't even finished gen eds here. In my head there are so many cons and I'm kinda losing my mind here, but I also am afraid that I'm sabotaging myself if I leave.

my tuition was quoted around 64,000 for one year(dorm cost was a part of that). i'm gonna explain this with my first semester since that is how they broke it down.

my app says i owe them 22,000 and some change for just my first semester, but this doesn't make sense with what i was awarded. i straight up can't afford almost 6k every month.

i was awarded a merit scholarship so that covers 7,500 for this semester, and my FAFSA would cover just about 18,000. 

i have three other things listed for this semester that are called:

Fed Direct Usub Stafford F/S 1 for $1,000

Fed Direct Sub Stafford F/S 1 for $1,750

and a workers study option for $2,500

(and they all say accepted below)

what doesn't make sense to me is my FAFSA and my scholarship is 25,500. i was told my aid was all applied already (when i called them) and that the 22,000 and change was what i owed now. for just one semester.

how is a semester 47,000? i just don't understand. i made sure i did the FAFSA's MPN and the counseling and i received conformation from FAFSA it was sent to the school, and i submitted all of that info on time. on the schools site it says that the 18,000 is offered, not accepted but i submitted everything a week ago.

i think it was only my scholarship that was taken off, but i'm not sure.

I planned on getting all the incomplete coursework done by the end of the summer. Summer is almost over and I still have a huge chunk of work to do. I have a scholarship too, which I don't know whether financial aid will renew or not after my incomplete work is done.

I'm wondering if taking this semester off would help me get the coursework done and figure out my right path.

I'm currently a \[21,F\] credit wise just finished my 2nd year of college, but have been attending college since 2018.

Long story short, I took some time off of college due to personal reasons and online learning due to COVID not working well for me. I decided I don't want to return to the university I currently attend because I'm was not happy with having a 2 hour commute (roundtrip) and since it is a commuter university my social life was always struggling. 

I originally planned on dropping out but, just recently my mom received disability from the military qualifying me to receive free tuition from any CA university. Before receiving this news I was already planning on moving down to San Diego, CA next year (2022), but now I figure I should start a transfer plan to SDSU since I want to move there anyway. However when I brought going to school down in San Diego to my mom she told me that by the time I go back to college as a 22-23 y/o I will be ""too old"" to experience college and that I am hopelessly chasing after an experience that I have already outgrown (making friends, social gatherings, etc) and I should just do an online BA program while working full-time. While I do agree that I would be too old to rush a sorority or go out to frat parties, I feel like I can still make friends on campus and network (I grew up kinda socially sheltered), but the more I think about it realistically I'm not sure if I would fit in socially due to my age or it could be my mom just getting into my head.

47,procuriosity_,1623620654,/r/college/comments/nz6t16/8_years_for_an_associates_feeling_defeated/,"Hey everyone. First post here. Sorry if this is in the wrong place. Just looking for some advice.

I've been struggling in computer science for a long time now, for different reasons. I flunked a lot of classes when I first started. I'm not going to give a long sob story, but eventually I decided to pull myself together. After 8 years in community college, it was finally time to apply for the computer science program at the university I've always dreamed of. The first time I met with the advisor, she took one look at my transcript and literally said it would be a waste of time to apply. I tried telling her I spoke with a counselor about why I failed so many classes, but she wouldn't hear it. She said the material must've been too hard for me. (Joke's on her - I made it into the program... But unfortunately she's the only computer science advisor and she remembers me. I get the displeasure of having to speak with her every semester.)

Now I'm working on my bachelor's, and it looks like it's going to be another long 3 years. I just feel very defeated. I've been working full-time and paying for tuition out of pocket through this. Now my struggle is trying to find the time for class.

I was consistently working 12 hour days as the AGM of a hotel. I quickly fell behind in the class I'm taking. This is not the first time I've fallen behind and had to skate by with a C in a class. I already tried speaking with my professor, and he basically told me to reach out to the TA or the Dean. (Strange) I thanked him and said I would reach out to the TA, and he responded ""Today is Sunday. Most people don't read emails on weekends. Please wait until Monday.""

Anyway I'm wondering if the problem is just me... Maybe I'm just completely failing at college. I already put in my 2 week notice at my job since it's too demanding. I want to work part time somewhere and refocus on school. I just feel like it's going to be a waste. I don't feel like I can compete with other people in the field. It's been 8 years and you'd think I would have learned more than Java and C++... but that's it. I also don't feel supported by the staff at my university and at this point I'm starting to build resentment toward the place.

Any advice on what I should do? Should I transfer to another college and maybe get a chance to start over? Should I keep going and just try to get more experience (and hopefully confidence) in the field? Anyone else with similar experiences?

TL;DR I took 8 years to get my associates. Now I'm getting my bachelors and I'm falling behind again because I can't balance work and school. My academic advisor and professors basically snub their noses at me. Has anyone had a similar experience?

Ive had a hard time finding what I'm passionate about in my major, and I have only 2 semesters left. I decided to participate in undergraduate research as I hoped that getting some hands on experience in the field would help me figure out my interests. In January, I reached out to a professor whose research interests seem fascinating, asking if she had any availability in her lab. She had a PhD student who needed an assistant, so I decided to join as an assistant. I didn't find the lab work that interesting from the start, but I didn't know any better (first time working in a lab), and I thought it would get more interesting as time went on and I became better trained--there was a LOT to learn. I was already struggling to get through all of my chemistry core classes as well at the same time-I still do decent in school, have around a 3.5 gpa . I honestly really tried, I took notes, always double checked everything, showed up on time, etc.. In April, on the last day of lab work, I was asked by the PhD student if I wanted to continue with lab work in the summer, I said yes, he said ok (I didn't even know they had summer work. Fast forward one week, I emailed the grad student,  asking about the lab schedule a couple of days before I was supposed to start as I thought it was wierd that I hadn't gotten the schedule yet.  Never heard anything back, I was ghosted. Fast forward to Monday (5 days ago), the professor emailed me asking if I had time to meet on Tuesday. Showed up to her office, she told me this : ""I talked with with graduate student, he said you are lazy, unmotivated, and not passionate, would you still like to consider working in the lab with us in the summer ?"" To which I said no, I think it's better if I resign,  and I walked out.  

It kind of hurt to hear, not going to lie, but ive used this as an opportunity to grow as a person. I've taken the past 5 or so days to reflect and be brutally honest with myself about my passions and my future ambitions. Ive realized that I'd be much happier if I finished out my undergrad and went to graduate school in a different field. A field which I am truly passionate about and love, and I've been interested in it since I was like 5, but my parents said they were not gonna pay my undergrad tuition if I went into this field

The first major mistake I did was not transfer out/drop my major after my first year. I did Industrial Engineering but *hated* every day of classes and struggled with depression, roommate problems, etc. I used to skip classes to sleep in to avoid dealing with my problems. Fast forward 5 years later and two trips to Texas (I wanted to seriously transfer out to a UT school and remember crying over the phone with my parents to let me leave) as well as countless hours of talking to my parents everyday, I graduated having made my parents spend $180,000 and having $20,000 in debt.

After graduation, I was able to find a job in Charlottesville, Virginia through some family contacts. However, after COVID-19 pandemic came, I lost my job and went on unemployment benefits for the last few months. It has been 7 months since losing my first job and I was lucky enough to find a temporary job at my local school district.

When I first started working as a substitute teacher, I did not like it and kept thinking about leaving for money at an engineering company. However, after careful consideration and doing personality tests and such, I decided that I want to become a teacher and spend the rest of my life teaching and then coming home to relax, spend time with family, watch football, etc. However, since my degree in undergrad had nothing to do with education, I would have to either go back to school for 4 years and get another BA degree or do 2-3 years in an online certification program and then go to graduate school after. All this would mean that I would have more debt to eventually pay back. My mom did say that she would risk investing all her pension money from my grandfather's will to spend on my education but I feel so depressed and my Uncles constantly lecture me everyday which does not help.

I had to quit some of them, and kept only two (and did pass only one). my boss came back after three months, and I got to keep the job I had while she was away, but with the tasks split in two.

The job itself is fun, and I'm in a solid leadership position. When she offered me the job, I kid myself into thinking that with the diploma I was getting, and the job I would have, I would be pretty far up for a guy in his early twenties, and thus I shouldn't quit and I would be even more motivated. Lord was I wrong. I work a normal 40hrs/week schedule, and I have three classes, but I don't feel like studiying at all. I'm young, I want to leave my parent's house someday and buy myself a house, but my tuition kills me. I like doing stuff like woodworking but I can't because I have to study, which I do little to not at all but spend my time stressing over the fact that I haven't done anything. 

I seriously love my job and would drop out uni any time, but I don't want to dissapoint my parents. Neither of them have higher education than tradeschool, whilst I only have a generic college degree and an unfinished university course. They've been invested so much into my success and I don't want to let them down, but I don't know what to do. I'm kind of halfway to get my degree, but I'd finish in like five years at this pace. I haven't done sh\*t since semester started, and we're almost at the mid-term.... What should I do? lol

So, I think I can thank Covid for the last year in some way. It's given me clarity and opportunities that I never had. Altought I'm certain I will probably quit uni soon, I was given the chance to see what I wanted to do really, and that college/university isn't made for everyone.

To all of you down here, struggling with studies, keep working hard, but know your limits. Being twenty and not knowing what to do is fine. It's okay to take a knee, and try again later if you feel like it. Take care of yourselves.

First off, I really lucky that my college tuition is being paid for from my dads GI bill (he used to be in the navy) and it’s all being spent on me. But I have been putting all his hard work and sacrifice to waste and I failed my 2nd 3rd &amp; 4th semester at uni. My 2nd sem at uni was when everything started going downhill. My mental health was deteriorating, I was struggling to stay focused on school, and I felt so lonely with the lack of friends. My daily routine was wake up, go to class, go straight home, play video games/watch anime, then sleep. My lifestyle has been like that since I was a high schooler(I’m 21 now). 

I had terrible grades from 2nd sem thru 4th sem. I kept telling myself every semester that I would redeem myself and get my grades up but I couldn’t get myself to do it. It spiraled down even further when I had to dropout of my 3rd semester because of health problems and I went blind in my right eye. I still haven’t recovered mentally from my vision loss. I was a semester behind and I didn’t feel like going to college anymore. It was just the same thing day in day out. I bombed my grades with all Fs. Tried again on my 4th semester and if I didn’t pass I would be suspended for a year. I’ve wasted so much of my dads money on college and I just kept failing. During 4th sem I just skipped classes midway through and just gave up. Whenever my parents asked for my grades, I would just send them a photoshopped image of A’s and B’s and telling them I was doing fine. Online school became too difficult to focus on when I already had a hard time focusing in classes. Getting a degree wasn’t something I was striving for and I only attended college because my parents wanted me to.

It has been a month since I attended uni and I feel it’s too late to contact any of the staff there. My dad received a letter saying I wouldn’t receive benefits anymore due to not meeting grades and absences. I told him I was still attending classes but I don’t know if I can keep up with so many lies. He’s coming back home in a couple hours and I feel like he wants to ask me about the letter but I don’t know what to do. Help?

55,therapyscones,1612993073,/r/college/comments/lh4m8s/do_colleges_really_expect_us_to_believe_they_dont/,"I am graduating in May (god willing). I moved out of state to attend my particular program, but because of the pandemic I can no longer afford my apartment. At this moment I can't even technically afford to pay to break the lease. My FAFSA was actually based on my income when I was working full-time (I was told they don't update this once you reach senior-status) so my federal loans never reflected my actual situation. I opted to learn remotely this semester because of a history of health issues, and am in the process of moving back in with my parents.  


My school has a process where if you are struggling to pay the balance of your tuition, you can fill out an application explaining your situation and they will review it. I sent this to financial aid over three weeks ago. They sent me a reply saying they got it, and then I never heard back. The first monthly payment was due this week, so I contacted the business office to tell them that I was undergoing a review and hadn't heard yet. They told me I still had to pay the balance, I couldn't adjust the due date, and that there would be a late fee if I need more time. Shortly thereafter I checked my financial aid online and it said my balance was paid in full. Then I got an email from the business office saying I was actually going to get a REFUND check.  


This afternoon students got a mass email saying that they accidentally doubled everyone's scholarship amount (why on earth that would ever happen I can't even wager a guess) and that everyone's financial aid info was messed up for a couple days. I called them to ask when I can expect to hear back about the review process, they said they didn't know. I told them that the lack of communication and the clerical goof was something I take very seriously, because I am in a very serious financial situation trying to finish this degree. I told them I don't feel as though the full seriousness of how dire the financial circumstances are for students right now.  


I was told, oh OF COURSE they understand what students are going through. And I was told I did the ""right thing"" by advocating for myself. I'm almost 30 and I felt like I was being spoken to and treated like a kid. Pretty audacious considering you're charging me $30,000 a year.   


An hour and a half later I get an email saying that in response to my financial aid review there's ""no additional funding"" for me. But oh, I can enroll in a monthly payment plan if that helps!  


I know private universities are businesses and the bottom line is all that they really care about. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. But my school began a nearly $100 million apartment/shopping complex last year. And the reimbursement date for tuition has passed, so even if I were to unenroll I would still owe the same amount. I can't help but feel like, they knew I was going to have to cough up this money at some point so why would they help me? My school markets themselves as being an environment of solidarity and a perpetuator of social justice work, which I find sickening when I see how little is being done for students who are still struggling in a pandemic after almost a year.  


Be a private college, keep paying those administrators top dollar, keep watching the money roll in, fine. But don't pretend to care about the financial situation of your students, or about the idea of promoting equity in the world. Colleges absolutely have the resources to help their students out at this time, they are just choosing not to.

56,hughlyhuge,1612309319,/r/college/comments/lba1x0/i_kinda_need_some_advice_but_i_dont_feel_proud/,"Hey everyone,
So far, my first semester at college (one day in) has been...really shitty. I guess it's one thing where the class load is a little heavy, but, im at home, and I've been having some issues (my parent was laid off so our money situation is kinda going downhill unfortunately), it's been very tense at home between parents and I've had to sort of help out a lot more, and quite frankly I feel like my mental health has kinda gone from meh to just really bad, and...idk what to do. My college hasn't really been too helpful (I don't blame them, but it just feels like they really can't do too much), and my tuition has been kinda a huge thing on my mind, and furthermore I just feel so disconnected and honestly my gut feeling is telling me to run from this place. Whether it was orientation, classes, my numerous interactions with financial aid (not that they are bad, but I've just had an unpleasant time with them so far), and I guess feeling unwelcome and unable to feel welcomed has turned me off (I was kind of skeptical coming in, hoping to fall in love but...it didn't happen like I expected), and I'm I guess having buyers remorse? 


Moving on I just received an email from another college I was accepted to (it was between this or that college when I picked), and they seemed pretty receptive to have me at least try to gain readmission (it's a long story, basically I was allowed a deferal but things never moved forward), and I feel like I would genuinely be happier there. The issue is, they want to know if I've been taking any other 4 or 2 year institution courses, and while I'm fine with telling them about my cc courses I took last semester, idk how to tell them I'm in college or at least starting right now. Frankly I'd like to just go class of '25, fix my mental health right now, help my parents who are struggling, get my family settled, and then do college in the fall, but idk, I'm scared. I know this is a long post, but I was just wondering if anyone had any advice? What do I say to them? How do I deal with the institution I'm currently at?

Basically my first semester I signed up for a Japanese 112 course. My college requires 4 credits of a foreign language (Each course at my college is 1.0 credit). Little did I know that this Japanese class was way harder than anticipated and was taking up way too much of my time. I decided to drop this Japanese course as it was my first semester. I was already struggling to manage my time with track practice and my three other classes. Without Japanese, I was able to focus on my three classes and ended the semester with a 3.76 GPA. However, now we are in J-term/interim (one full credit class crammed into January) and I signed up for Spanish 111. I've been having a really hard time keeping up with the rigorous workload and 3 hour zoom classes at 5am (5 hour time zone difference). I have only been sleeping about 3 hours a night because of the workload and fast pace. I have fallen behind and am getting a 58%. I talked to my advisor and he gave me permission to drop it by tomorrow's deadline. But if I do I feel guilty for dropping another class because of tuition and the fact this is the second class I'd be dropping already. My advisor said it should be alright because I can now waive the foreign language requirement through a proctor exam because I know a little below mediocre Vietnamese which should be enough to pass the proficiency exam.

But due to my financial situation I don't think I can switch to another major because, well, it's expensive. It's not that the major I'm taking right now is cheap, but the tuition fees are already taken care of. 

I'm not here asking for advise about switching course because not everyone can get everything in life, but rather how do I make myself to like my course more, to have more passion in it? With my attitude I doubt that I'd be a good doctor when I graduated (I understand I can't just be a doctor with a bachelor's degree, but I'm just saying right now) and that's the last thing I want and the world needs. I'm planning to pursue other career related to my field with less risks that might harm a person.

The reason why I'm struggling now it's because it's the end of semester and I barely understand the subjects being taught to me. Part of this is because everything is so new and is taught in a very fast pace, before I can memorize lesson A, lesson B is taught and I have an assignment due. Basically my time management is a mess.+ I'm kinda of ashamed to say this but I prefer the language English over my mother tongue, Chinese. And whenever I'm studying a subject that's in Chinese, I'll have a hard time. (50% of my subjects are in Chinese and the other 50% are in English).

60,multiplanetaryalien,1608576399,/r/college/comments/khndzn/nervous_about_the_attendance_sheet/,"So I started college pretty late (one month after the rest of the grade) and it's my first year. I only missed 1 day of class, turned in all of the trimester class work in which I got good grades and I also did all the exams which I passed. For the final grades of the classes I failed 1 out of 6 with a 4/10 and my average is 7.5/10 (counting the failed one). When I started the trimester I asked my class representative and administration what I should do to sign in to all of my classes and it was said that administration was responsible for it. So I got access to all of my classes in the virtual campus aswell as other platforms in which I'm registered as a student and I also got all of my grading through the campus. And I payed all of the tuition fees. 

During class the teachers would pass an attendance list, but my name was never in it. Based on what administration and my classmates said, I thought it was due to the unis administration and my coming in so late. We've only had 2 months of class and due to covid my class was divided into 2 groups. I had to go personally to my uni 3 days a week while the other 2 days I had live online classes. Tomorrow I'm supposed to get my official grading document for the trimester to which I already know the grades. In the unis rules it is stated that after 14 consecutive days without attending class, the student gets an email saying that he/she is out of the uni, I haven't recieved such an email.

I'm struggling with intense social anxiety and ADHD, I'm in treatment for it, I know it all sounds pretty dumb, but I'm feeling nervous about the issue.

My first complaint is with the unorganized distribution of assignments. I am enrolled in 18 hours this semester with 6 instructors ALL using different platforms for students to complete/submit assignments. This may not sound bad but considering that 4 of my instructors are using multiple online programs this means that the work load can be overwhelming but also difficult to keep organized. On the smaller side of things us students our required to pay for these online programs out of pocket as they are not covered in the cost of the tuition. Another issue is the lack of interest from professors, and unfortunately being online means that communication is vital to understanding what the instructor is demanding. If I send an email that is urgent to an assignment it is a shame to have to wait 5 days or God forbid not get a response back. Not only is it discouraging to students but at times can leave us hopeless and confused. A few of my professors are requiring that students take all exams through a third party proctoring program called Examity. While it is one of the best ways to encourage academic honesty if you have used such programs like Examity you may come to realize how unfair the online testing process is. If your internet disconnects during the exam you will receive a zero, if your dog starts barking you will receive a zero, if your computer crashes you will receive a zero. These are all occurrences that can happen to ANYONE at any given time. Another inconvenience is that one of my professors is requiring ALL students to physically attend the test at the given date and time. While this is a minor inconvenience for me some students will have to fly/drive from very far distances for a 1 hour exam, this would be okay except that the class is labeled as ""Full Online"".

65,Magixal123,1599900436,/r/college/comments/ir9444/considering_dropping_out_advice/,"Hello,
This is a bit long so if you take the time to read this I seriously thank you. Just for context, I've been thinking about this for a while now. Its a shame because I'm very fortunate in having 100% of my college paid for. I dont pay for tuition, housing, books, none of it. I've earned enough in scholarships (most of these are smaller but they add up) and my dad is considered a 100% disabled veteran, which qualifies me for chapter 35 (basically a monthly check while i attend school) on top of my tuition being paid for by the military.

In all honesty I don't believe I was prepared to attend college. I went through high school like it was nothing. I never had to study because I just understood everything so easily. I graduated top 5% of my class never studying for any class outside of physics. I suppose, as egotistical as it sounds, this made me believe I was just smart and I assumed college wouldn't be that big of a step.

I tried to get in to a 4 year university of my choice, actually my dream school. I didnt even have to write the entry essay because of my SAT scores. I moved down to my dorm and classes began the next week. Im a computer science major, just realized I didnt mention that. First week of college was ridiculously easy. 2 of my classes didnt even have class because of covid, and the rest of them were online. My only assignment was to right a 100 word paragraph introducing myself (this took like a minute or two). 

The next week, I couldn't even keep up. I had to take trigonometry my first year, and during our first lecture I was keeping up with the professor just fine, understanding everything. Then he brought up cosine and sine and how they made relations to the arc of a circle, and he completely lost me. Everyone around me seemed to understand completely. Everything after that point in the lecture, everything went over my head. After the lecture I asked the processor if he could briefly cover that small section again with me, and he told me the lecture was recorded and is online if i need to rewatch it, asking me to leave the room, when I asked him where online I could find it, he just said ""On... Line..."" proceeding to close the door between us. So I went all over the processors website, clicking every link possible trying to figure out where the lecture was. And it wasnt there. Turns out he waited 2 days before even posting the video of the lecture. The audio was awful. I could barely hear the professor, and trying to actually understand what words he was saying was a different story. The video was also pointed at an empty wall, only making it harder to follow along. I picked up a textbook to try to keep up but at the pace I was catching up it seemed so hopeless. This is only one class. I have 4 other classes. I'd spent days, trying to figure out this first assignment, for one class.

This started negatively affecting my health. I found myself eating less. There have been times in the past weeks that i have gone 3 or 4 days without eating anything. As of now I'm maybe eating once a day, sometimes skipping a day. Depressed isnt a word I like to use, just because I feel like people will say I'm being dramatic, or theres people out there who have it worse, but I dont know what else to call it. I feel trapped. My girlfriend is getting worried for me assuming I'll do something regrettable. I cant drop out of college because I'll lose financial aid (obviously). If i lose financial aid I wont be able to afford my dorm. I have the option to break my lease if i drop out, but id be required to pay for the next 3 months of rent even though I'm not staying there. I've considered just not showing up for college and working full time but excessive absences could lead to an ""unofficial withdrawl"".

I know the ""right answer"" is to suck it up, study my life away, and magically become successful in all my classes. This is a big decision, and I wont ever have an opportunity again to have college all expenses covered. I feel like my past few weeks of struggling cost me a life time of success. If i fail even one of my classes this semester then my financial aid is revoked and right now im still 2 weeks behind in trig. In all honesty im afraid of what the world has in store for me. I dont know if I'll be able to provide for my girlfriend, and in the future if i have a family. Im considering other options, but it almost feels like my only options are somehow barely pass all my classes, or be forced to join the military (I am not saying the military is a bad option for those who choose to do it. But in my situation, I don't want to be sent away when theres people here who need me). I feel like dropping out of college would only make me a failure. I dont know what the odds of me actually being able to take care of myself are.

Please be 100% honest with any advice. I am not easily offended, and I'd prefer brute honesty over sugar coated lies. Thank you if you've made it this far.",college,Considering dropping out.. Advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ir9444/considering_dropping_out_advice/,1599918436.0

Yet I’m stuck here next morning, thinking about how I truly miss living in Colorado and thinking when I’ll be moving over when I have enough money after college.

With the whole virus thing going on, the school decided to go into a blended way of learning. 

I eventually chose to go remote because my school used to be 90% covered by financial aid and all my tuition was covered but now it is more expensive due to online stuff... My mom is a waitress so her hours got cut heavily and we are struggling. Talking to financial aid got me another scholarship but it still wasn't enough. My family decided that it would be best to do remote because then I wouldn't have to pay room and board. 

Even though this decision is the most money saving, I still regret it. I had a job at school, a good friend group, and most importantly I had a class that was something I really was passionate for and would give me a lot of experience since it was basically an internship as a class. Most students in that class are going in person anyways so I feel extra left out. My professors are still doing it blended but I definitely think I'd get more out of my classes in person. I know that people are saying they'll probably shut down anyways halfway and that I couldn't be able to spend time with my friends due to restrictions but I still feel a bit sad.

I am currently taking all of my classes online and residing with family on the East coast due to the pandemic. As of now, my Uni is still supporting my in-state status when it comes to the cost of attendance. 

So my question/concern comes from a survey my teacher sent out. The purpose to help with accessibility during this pandemic. This question in particular has me struggling to figure out how honest I should be: ""Are there any things in your living situation now that may complicate your capacity to successfully learn and work at home? For example, do you now have an unpredictable schedule, new commitments or responsibilities, or other unknowns that will be helpful for us to know about?""

Now for some more background. My dads company is sending him to Moscow for work and he is taking the family with. We do not have a firm move date because of the pandemic. We have our visa invitations but do not have any appointments lined up at the Russian embassy. My dad is guesstimating that maybe we will end up in Russia come October. But of course no one knows that for sure. 

So should I be honest with my teacher about the move? I think telling her about the move would help her to better understand what I am dealing with due to the time difference. Class is 3 days a week from 10am -5pm PST but due to the time change, would be from 8pm-3am once in Russia. 

To sum things up...should I tell her now in this survey or wait until classes are underway and the move actually happens? or not at all? Would this change my tuition status?",college,Should I tell my Uni.

My university’s plan for Fall semester involved letting the faculty choose which method of instruction they wanted to do, whether it be Asynchronous(lectures posted on Blackboard, we do all the work on our own time and just meet deadlines) or Synchronous(we have to show up to an online lecture at a specific date and time, like a normal class).

They also completely flipped the instructors for the courses and the meeting times, so now I’m stuck with one of my major courses being Synchronous MW from 11:30AM-12:45PM and the other major course being Synchronous TTH 12:40PM-1:55PM.  

They are also taught by the same professor, who  is one of the most rated and LOWEST rated professors at the university.  

I really have to work during the semester to pay my own bills and tuition costs, so my schedules are usually designed to give myself as many off-days or large chunks of time off in between classes as possible.  With these classes now being smack dab in the middle of the day, 4 days a week, I now am looking at not being able to work Monday - Thursday, just for an hour class each day.

I was thinking of emailing my department chair and essentially just telling him why I have to work on top of being a student and letting him know that I would really be struggling to make this schedule work.  I’d leave out the part about the terrible prof, that’s just salt in my wound..

Is this worth even trying?  I can’t honestly expect anything to come of it and am scrambling to figure out how I’m going to keep an income with this god-awful schedule, but I do want to at least make my situation known to someone higher up.

I cross posted this to r/veterans but I’m gonna try here to see if anyone has any advice or know where I can start. I’ve tried talking to friends/family but my family hasn’t gone to college and my friends tell me to pursue what degree they’re pursuing and I don’t think they’ve been in this boat. 

I was using the GI bill to attend the university here in Utah. I went to school for 3 semesters and during the 3rd semester I started having a lot of trouble. 

I have a mental illness and so I was struggling with that a bit and struggling making friends. During this semester, my grandpa died and I was really upset when I lost him. 

Lastly, the VA changed my gi bill percentage from 100% to 70% and said I had to pay the tuition and housing stipend for that 3rd semester back. 

All of these things combined just crushed me and I basically just stopped functioning for a few months. I stopped doing school work. I stopped talking to people. I didn’t open my school email. It was a dark time. I worked my part time job and slept. 

It’s been about 9 months since this all occurred and I want to get my life back on track and continue school. I don’t want to work my part time job forever. 

I’m not sure where to start from here. I’m certain I failed all of my classes during that 3rd semester. I won’t be able to afford university even at 30%, I don’t think, and I’m not sure I want to go back. Community college may be better and easier for me to commute to. I have to work during school to afford my bills and I enjoy my job and don’t wanna lose it.

I will have to figure out a way to pay the other 30% of tuition, going forward, and I’m kind of lost. 

Does anyone have any advice or know what I can do from here? Do I switch schools? Do I transfer from a university to a community college?

I was pursuing a computer science degree, I had around a 3.5 gpa my first 2 semesters but the 3rd one all f’s I think so it’s probably really low now and looks bad.

So, help me out guys. 

Should I run away to France (if it’s even open to international travel at that point), buy a van and live on the road down the coast for a semester with my dog? Sink my money into an Airbnb in Manhattan and take up street performing? 

If quarantine has taught me one thing, it’s that I need to get out and *live,* that being said, I also want to graduate university at some point and if I take an entire semester off school...the probability of my returning is pretty darn low. So I guess that means I’m going to need to take some online courses in the fall. Yippy. 

Although, If I take courses online that doesn’t necessarily mean that I *need* to live at home, right? Anyone here traveled while taking online courses? I guess I’d need a pretty good internet connection to do that, so maybe the van trip down the coast is out….although cafes’ have internet… No. No, the van trip is out. 

Another thing I’ve seriously been considering is talking some friends into running away with me and just being a family of wild children; taking online business degrees, while living in different countries periodically, working in nightclubs, maybe some little bakeries, and trying not to fall in love - thoughts?

How are you guys planning to handle the move online (if it applies to you)?

I know this post is all over the place. But. Stay with me. Since I was, oh Idk - 17 maybe - I’ve wanted to spend a semester between France &amp; Italy - I always imagined going in the spring (anyone know what september - december is like?) but whatever. Anyway, when I started university last year I arranged my courses in a way that would make it possible for me to take a full course load online with a cheaper university if I even decided to make my France/Italy dream a reality...Is this a ‘good’ opportunity? Or, do I wait it out until the world finds stable ground again and go in a coming spring? 

Of course that leads me to my other option of just sucking it up; living at home, hopefully maintaining/deepening some of the friendships I made at university last year, and taking a course load with the university I'm at now...sounds kinda dull ik.

1) I’m going to be an incoming nursing major in the fall and I’m kind of having a bit of a crisis because I’m just now realizing I have no idea how to write an essay and I’m probably going to have to write a ton soon. I remember writing like two essays in all of senior year and they were personal essays. 

2) I also have very bad study habits and habits in general. I feel like I bsed my way through all of high school because I didn’t really have to apply myself for good grades. That probably won’t cut it in college and I’m starting to freak out a bit. 

3) Another thing is that my family is pretty well off so I didn’t get much financial aid from FAFSA but my parents are also not willing to help pay for college. With scholarships and all, my yearly fees are going to be about 36k and honestly idek if that’s considered a lot. 

4) I’m trying to go for an ROTC scholarship or something but I’m not a US citizen yet and I can’t be certain that I’ll be getting the scholarship. Another hope is that I could walk on to my school’s rowing team and hope I can get some money out of that but I don’t know if I’ll for sure get anything. I just know that they’re very generous when giving out scholarships to athletes. I’m definitely going to do one or the other whether I’m getting any money or not but it sure would be nice.

79,CureForPessimism,1584631147,/r/college/comments/flbpt9/im_failing_my_freshman_year_of_college_what_do_i/,"I’m just going to jump straight into some context.

I had no friends growing up. None. I’ve gone my entire life up till my freshman year of college not knowing the true feeling of having friends, primarily due to my selective mutism as a young kid and later my non-verbalism throughout high school. Because of my terrible social anxiety, I grew to loathe myself. I often let my grades plummet throughout my childhood. It’s not that I wasn’t capable; school was a breeze if I actually gave two shits about paying attention or turning work in. I wouldn’t say I’m inherently stupid. It’s just that I lacked the motivation to do literally anything. I procrastinated to the utmost degree and never gave anything my all. I grew up in a constant depressed state and was prepared to end my life during my college years because I only ever saw myself as a failure of a person. For a long time I couldn’t imagine myself improving, and I’d convinced myself that I was destined to be that way for the rest of my sad life.

However, I miraculously proved myself wrong. I actually made a friend. By pure chance, I somehow actually managed to become close with a single person (let’s call her Elle) at my university. She’s fantastic, and spending so much time with her and becoming close with one another has really opened my eyes to how exciting having friends can be. However, I let my fears get the better of me these past two quarters. I was (and still am, admittedly) so terrified of losing Elle that I accepted every one of her invites to her dorm, during which we would always stay up till 4 AM. This was on a several-times-per-week basis. I went to every house party and every recreational event I was invited to by her. It’s not that Elle is a poor student in any regard; she’s actually incredibly on top of things. However, thus far she’s taken far easier and less demanding courses than I have, and I’d say I spend generally more time on my large-scale projects than she does. Regardless, I spend all of my time with her. I go to all of these things with her, not only to make myself happy, but also because I have a deep rooted fear that I’m going to lose her as a friend if I spend too little time with her, which is why I spend the most time possible with her. Maybe anyone would understand if this was their only experience with having and maintaining a friendship, but I can understand how most people would think of me as simply idiotic. From a logical view, I know that she wouldn’t mind if I took some time to actually focus on school, but I just can’t shake that fear and I don’t know how to.

Because of these time-wasting tendencies, I failed a single course my first quarter. I passed the other two with A’s, but the F really took a blow to my GPA. Second quarter, I’m fairly positive I failed all three courses. I haven’t received my grades yet, but I have a feeling I didn’t do well in any of them. First quarter was pretty bad since I couldn’t manage keeping up with all of my classes with my friend-invested schedule, so instead I put all my efforts into two classes while letting the third slip. Second quarter was an even bigger disaster, however. I’m usually a very punctual person, and being late to or missing anything has always been out of the question for me, unlike my friend, Elle. She‘s skipped a couple classes here and there for the sake of taking more time to complete work outside of class. One day, her own tendency rubbed off on me. I boldly skipped one of my design classes because I desperately needed more time to finish work for another. This turned into a habit. I began skipping more classes, and until two of my professors reached out to me about it, I had already skipped 2-3 classes per each of their courses. I had drastically fallen behind in all three courses, and it was nearly the end of the quarter. Because my stupid ass thought it best to spend all my free time hanging out with Elle during my final few weeks rather than catching up in my classes, I ended up staying behind in all of those courses. Second quarter ended a week ago, and I am so utterly terrified of what I’ve done, not only because I always manage to gradually ruin my life, but also because I now have to explain this to my parents.

My parents know that I’m capable. They expect big things from me. I was ecstatic during my first quarter and would constantly tell them how pumped I was to excel in my courses and finally get a strong start on life from here. I lied to them when I got my grades back for first quarter. I lied to them when I was struggling during second quarter. I told them I was okay. I wanted to appear responsible, ironically I suppose. My dad wants my first quarter grades back and has been pressing about it for months. I always tell him I’ll get back to him with them, don’t, and then tell him I forgot next time he questions me about it. I purposefully avoided calling my parents nearly as much as I did during first quarter because I feared my dad would ask for my grades again. Now that I’m stuck at home, I can’t avoid it. I’m going to have to spill the beans within the coming days and I’m mortified. I’m scared of disappointing my parents, and I know how much my success means to them. How do I go about telling them?

I know that I’ve effectively wasted a quarter’s worth of tuition, and I have nobody but myself to blame. I know that I’m clearly not prepared for college life and that I should’ve taken a gap year, like my parents had initially insisted, even though I hated (and still hate) that prospect. I started cutting again. I can’t stand myself right now. How does everyone else seem to balance their outside of school life and their school life? Why is it so fucking difficult for me to find that medium?

I don’t want to leave Elle. I don’t want to be alone again. I want this feeling to stay, but I think I already blew my chances. There’s only one quarter left, and my GPA is already down the gutter. I don’t think I can save myself. Either I’ll get booted from school if I can’t maintain a perfect A average this coming quarter or my parents will force me out. Deep down I want to stay, but I worry that I may not have that option.

The whole coronavirus outbreak led to my college dismissing the entire school for spring quarter. We’re doing online classes from home, and I’m confident that this could be my saving turnaround. I won’t have to worry about spending excessive amounts of time with Elle in person. I’m prepared to bust my ass off working hard. I want to achieve good grades. I really do. I want to do well in life. But simultaneously, there’s something deep down telling me that I’m lying to myself. I tell myself the same shit often, but I never come through. But I know that I have to come through this time, because the consequences for not doing so are too immense.

But what should I really do at this point? Where do I go from here? Do I accept failure, learn from it and continue to pass my courses with flying colors? Is it even possible for someone to bounce back from such failure during their freshman year? Should I transfer and sink into an even deeper depression? Should I give up on college? Or should I just give up entirely? Because at this point, I don’t see myself ever becoming a better person. No matter how much I want to be successful, I always end up screwing myself over and failing. I want nothing more than to die right now and I have no idea how to express that adequately with words.",college,I’m failing my freshman year of college.

When we got to the store it was a very somber mood as people looking for essential items like diapers couldn't get any because stockpilers had been buying so many. Employee's looked pretty exhausted running around trying to keep up with demands while also sanitizing surfaces. Being a former retail worker I feel their pain.

We decided to grab lunch from a local Chinese takeout place since the restaurant shutdown to try and support local businesses. When I went to grab my order I just saw an older woman watching Korean dramas on her phone waiting with my order while her husband worked in the back prepping food. I gave them a tip hoping to try and boost their revenue in these trying times. I wanted to give her a hug so bad it hurt. 

Then when I got home I got an email  from my workplace on campus stating they would be closing the building until further notice. I'm a student employee meaning most of my work is done at an IT desk. Physically moving computers, or working on emails meaning much of the work I do can't be done remotley. My manager said they are working to see if they can find work for us to do remotley in the meantime but that means all my shifts for this current week are gone. All the shifts I had planned for break are now gone too which I was depending on for significant revenue to help pay off tuition. 

My university is closed so its not like I've been able to see many of my friends or coworkers as often and many of them have relatives of much older age so they are trying to quarantine themselves. Not to mention my much older family members, while not living near me, are living in Europe and very close to a larger outbreak of the virus.

I never expected my last few months of college to feel so somber and frustrating. I was just sitting in my room feeling so stressed with the world and the fact I still needed to finish final assignments for this quarter online but then my neighbor messaged me. I had baby sit her cats recently so she had my number on hand. She invited us to come hang out in their driveway and drink a bit (while sitting 6 feet apart from each-other of course). Me and my parents went over with Baileys and chairs as more of our neighbors gathered around to sit in the driveway.

I'm struggling. So many days are hell. I procrastinate into the stratosphere. My grades aren't great. If my GPA goes below 3.0, I lose my scholarship.

Sometimes when I'm working on stuff at night my whole body starts to shake and I get wierd spasms. Then I start to cry. I just get overwhelmed with the thought that I can't do it. My sleeping patterns are out of whack. I go to bed at 2 - 3 am and get up at 12 - 1 pm.

I might have GAD. I don't know. I just feel like I haven't grown up. It's so hard to be an adult when I don't feel like one. I'm desperately trying to enjoy my life.

If my parents hadn't made me go to college, I don't know if I would have gone. I don't know my career path. I'm not passionate about anything profitable. My current intended major is Psychology; I could maybe see myself as an HR person or something. I'm an emotional person. Last semester my major was Database Technology, but I failed my intro to programming class, so I changed it.

I've considered the idea of eventually becoming a house husband for my girlfriend. Considering I might never find above-minimum-wage work due to my incompetence, it would be the best way for me to contribute. And I like that dynamic (forgive me if that's tmi). But she's poly and says she wants to live with one of her other mates eventually. Might still work but I don't know.

I don't know if my parents would ever forgive me if I dropped out. They said that they'll pay my tuition (but not my debt) once my bank account runs dry. They believe in me, they're investing in me. If I dropped out, they would have to pay my defaulted loan. I would be scared to face them. Espicially my dad. He's not abusive, but he's not espicially pleasant either.

Currently, I (19F) am a second semester sophomore at a fairly prestigious liberal arts school, majoring in economics and liberal arts business. However, I am really, really struggling mental-health wise in econ. I have been doing well in the classes, but every time I walk into the classroom, I have anxiety attacks. I've been in counseling and everyone around me (my roommate, my counselor, my econ and business profs, etc), including me,  think that I should drop econ down to a minor while I still can.

However, this is where I run into a problem. I talked about the idea of dropping my econ degree down to a minor last semester with my parents, and while my mom doesn't mind so much either way, my dad got really upset at the idea. He thinks that an econ major will help to open doors, while the business major won't necessary close doors, but certainly won't help. I really do understand where he is coming from, he just wants me to be successful and have the ability to succeed in many different fields, but at this point, it's causing so much stress that I really don't know if it is worth it. The other issue is that, while I have a scholarship covering half tuition, my parents are fully covering my tuition (something I am *very* grateful for). This means I feel kind of guilty about wanting to say screw it and do what's best for me.

87,7medium,1581388669,/r/college/comments/f21omt/what_is_with_all_of_the_bad_press_for_full_sail/,"I’m going to be attending Full Sail sometime this August/September and I’ve never been more excited. I’m entering the Game Design course and could not be more stoked. So far I have had nothing but positive experiences with people from Financial Aid and any other service trying to help, really. From what I’ve been through during enrollment and setting everything up, it’s been great. 

However, recently I’ve encountered a lot of less-than-stellar feedback - most notably from older Reddit posts. This surprised me because from the alumni I know, I’ve heard nothing but praise - other than the workload being heavy but manageable. People claim it’s a scam, a corporate cash-grab, and utterly useless. I’m looking for some fresh opinions on the matter to try to understand where this is from. 

TL;DR From what I’ve experienced, Full-Sail is very non-traditional and not for everyone but it does so much to cater to its students to provide everything they need to be successful. So where is all of this negativity coming from when all I've seen from my first-hand experience is positive? 


I want to address some points I have already seen first, but I'm open to opinions.

Mostly I’ve seen claims that:

1. It’s a for-profit mill that just wants your money. 

There are many for-profit colleges. Sure, some can be shady as goes with any business but it’s unfair to judge only on that. Theoretically, a good for-profit college would strategically strive to create quality education to appeal to shareholders. It can seem intimidating at first but the business moto allows for more out of the box approaches and fewer limitations.

The money being made also goes to the students. Tours of Full Sail have shown that they provide top-quality resources. The campus is beautiful and has mind-blowing equipment and full film sets the size of a shopping district. The money being made is really being put into use for the students and alumni.

2. The tuition is way too high and the Financial Aid services are only there to get you loans so they can take your money.  

After some simple research, it seems Florida’s average tuition for 4-year colleges is about $14k which would be roughly $56k for all 4 years.

Full Sail’s average total paid tuition for a bachelor’s is about $55k. This is on-par with the average. For comparison, UCF’s average tuition for 4-years is in the $60k range. 

In my personal experience, the Financial Aid program did whatever they could to help me. They didn’t shove loans down my throat and, instead, guided me to scholarships. The qualifications for these scholarships were reasonable and weren’t very demanding. The only thing I needed to do was write one 500 word essay about creativity. After everything, I - a semi-decent student who absolutely hated school and struggled to keep up - got enough for a full ride and then some, all without loans. It felt too easy.

Another note, they even offer monthly aid for students to comfortably live off of while in class. If you play your cards right and do your research, you can get paid to attend.

3. The workload is too crammed, you’re getting less education.

From what I understand, Full Sail is very non-traditional. Over a 20 - 28 month span, students are taking about 1 to 2 (maybe 3 at *most*) classes per month. To many, this seems unreasonable and many would wonder how anyone is getting anything useful out of it. 

After doing workshops, speaking with alumni, and talking with counselors, what I understand is that it’s more or less streamlined. Traditional colleges have semesters that are 12 - 15 weeks where students take usually 4 - 6 classes. In the same timeframe, Full Sail students will have taken 4 - 8 classes. In addition, there are fewer breaks. The total number of classes attended and hours spent learning are generously much higher for students at Full Sail.

It can be argued that you can’t learn much from one month of taking a class. To that, I say that it’s circumstantial. Professors recommend that students do not work during their time enrolled unless they want to get burnt out. So you’d be giving your undivided attention to the coursework. Also, I’d say that taking one or two classes at a time is actually a much better system for absorbing information. 

Full Sail is very different in it’s approach to education. Most of us are used to growing up and going to school taking 6 - 8 classes (depending on the school system) each year. This is what we’re used to. However, it can be argued that switching between so many different subjects so frequently is distracting and can be overwhelming. For many, it is better to focus on a few things than jump from Math to History to Art to Foreign Language. 

As a personal anecdote: during the end of high school, I had started struggling to keep up with the courses and my GPA was dropping. My parents made the call to enroll me in virtual school online. At first, I did the same thing, balancing many classes at once. That was until I decided to try taking one class at a time and going through it in a month or so. It was one of the best decisions I made and everything started to become easier. I absorbed the information much faster and retained it for longer. 

To be fair, this learning style is not for everyone. Many people would do much better in the traditional setting. However, Full Sail seems to want to attract passionate and eccentric students who aren't the norm. For learning disabilities like ADHD, strategically hyper-focusing on one class is a blessing. 

On another note, there really aren’t filler classes. I know many people who have gone to college and wound up taking a lot of basic core classes that didn't benefit their major at all. While that isn’t always true, it definitely isn’t true for Full Sail. The core classes are developed for the student’s course so that every class is going to end up being beneficial.

4. The dropout rate is high. 

43% doesn’t look very good. Touching back on the previous point: the course regiment isn’t for everyone. Those without experience in the unique setting could find that they don’t fare very well with that type of learning. 

With that being said, the acceptance rate is 100%. Generally, colleges with higher graduation rates also have a very low acceptance rate. Most universities are trying to get the best students to make themselves look better. Colleges with a 70% graduation rate are accepting only 50% of students. 

5. Courses like Game Design are worthless credentials. Employers are looking for experience, not a degree. 

Unlike many colleges, Full Sail is designed to give real-world experience and to build up an expanded portfolio. You’re not going to be thrown information and then released into the real world, you’re going to work on real projects so that you’re immediately ready to take charge. The professors are equipping students with the tools and experience that employers are looking for and there will be a lot of evidence to show for it.

I graduated high school in 2011, and then enrolled in my dream school at 18. I had no clue my path or direction but I thought once I got to college my life would end up where it needed to go. I was illl-prepared mentally, financially, and emotionally for being in that stressful situation. I came from a very small insulated community, where my classmates were once’s I had known since Pre K. My first year in college I struggled to make friends, deal with my mental health, balance working and going to school, and coping with the fact that I went to a high school that didn’t prepare me at all for college. After my second semester I was placed on academic warning for grades after getting an F and D in two of my four classes. After my third semester I was put on academic probation, severed my semester off, then came back. 

Those first two years I was dealing with mental health- depression, anxiety, PTSD. My family doesn’t belief in mental health and it was like pulling teeth at my university to get treatment. I didn’t have the funds to find a provider off campus, but even if I had, it would’ve been hard because there are so few in the town where the university is located. I finished 4 semesters in 2.5 years and had been on academic probation twice. I couldn’t learn effectively because I was struggling with working to survive and my mental health. I took it as a sign to get my life together, and moved forward working on my mental health and financial stability. 

Fast forward to this fall. I decided last spring that I was in a place that I could give it a shot to go back to college at 26, so I moved back to the small town where my dream university is at and enrolled. I didn’t have any financial aid because of my poor performance 6 years prior so I worked and had money set aside for tuition and living expenses. I took classes that I was interested in, and really started to enjoy the semester. I struggled a bit to make friends, being so much older at a college that is largely made of 18 year old freshman to 22 year old seniors, I struggled being away from the support system I have built with my partner and friends, and I struggled with being a trans POC in today’s America. But I had fun with my semester, enjoyed most of my classes, and worked hard. 

I received notice today that because I got a C in my online math class, the class I struggled with the most, and two other Bs I have been dismissed from the university because my overall GPA didn’t reach the required GPA to meet academic success after suspension. I worked it out and to get my overall GPA to the point I would’ve had to have gotten a 4.0. I’m pretty upset, and I feel very defeated. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has any words of encouragement or stories of triumph to share? I’m not sure yet what my plan is, but from the wording of the email I got I don’t think I’m able to appeal the dismissal, so I doubt that will be in my future. 

Also does anyone know if this will hurt me if I go to a CC and try to transfer to another university?",college,Feeling defeated after working hard all semester; looking for sage wisdom or stories of triumph in similar situation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/efzq0e/feeling_defeated_after_working_hard_all_semester/,1577406546.0

I decided to attend my state uni since it was known to be the most prestigious in the state and it was very much affordable. I managed to get a very very generous financial aid package that covers almost all of my yearly tuition, and since I have a part time work study job, my parents have decided to not worry about paying for my college tuition (except for dorm things). So thankfully, they've not had to worry about it which I'd prefer for it to stay that way. 

Thing is, when I looked at my financial statement in the campus bursa, I saw that there was a charge of ~$711 for tuition which remained after financial aid applied, which I was unaware of the cost till now. I looked it over and realize this might be how it is for the next four years, not even my work study and spending habits could cover the cost each year. The reason I didn't get a loan was because my parents did not allow for it since it builds up interest rates over time according to them, so we decided it would be handled by us (or me in this case). 

And just recently, I've had to drop a course I was inevitably going to fail for the semester which meant I had to pay back ~$800 for dropping it since I'm under a scholarship in-state. And I can't even afford to pay that back right now which means I might be temporarily barred from the scholarship next semester until I pay it back. Even worse, my parents don't know that I had to drop a course and was charged a lot for it. 

I've looked into Boro but they require a 3.0 GPA and I'm only in my first semester so I haven't gotten back my final GPA for fall, and I'm not sure I could even pull a 3.0 since I'm struggling in CS right now. And I'm not sure if University loans would be a good idea due to excess charges and interest. 

Is this a good idea? My parents would not be happy with this but I'm sure I could pay it off quick given the field I'm looking to go into (cybersecurity). I'd like to be able to do this without letting them know and dealing with this on my own if that's possible since I wouldn't want to burden them. If so, I'd estimate about $6000 which I think shouldn't be too bad. Thank you.

I was a mess when in 2nd year and was a depressed anxious shut-in by the time it ended, so I decided to spend a year out to get my shit together. Which I did. I got a lot healthier, worked a proper job and lost a ton of weight. All in all, good year and I thought I was ready to take on 3rd year. But now I'm back at uni, and I'm realising that the improvements weren't enough. I came back and passed all my resits (I had 4 because of how bad I was in 2nd year) but I still hate it here, I still can't make friends, I still can't motivate myself, keep up with the course, I still have all the mental health issues I had before, they're just less bad.

I want to have a good year that I enjoy and get good grades in. Just so I can graduate with a decent degree and a good uni experience. Neither of those seems seems like bad motivation to me, nobody wants to have a miserable time and then graduate with a 2nd class degree. Which is what I'm on track for right now, and I'm already having so much trouble just staying afloat there's no way I could actually thrive this year. And I can't just pure drop out now, because I've spent 2&lt; years and god knows how much money on this bullshit.

I wanted some advice on what I should do because the uni has been basically useless. The support team tells me to talk to my tutor and my tutor tells me to talk to the support team. 

Having spoke with a friend, the ideal situation seems to be: put all this behind me, move home and work a low maintenance job for a year while working on myself, transfer to a uni I can go to from home and finish up there. Then actually start my life up again. It seems best because I got issues, and I can't work on them out here alone, stressed and barely managing to keep going.

The money situation seems fucked. I have no idea how my dorm would work, nor how the maintenance loan would. As far as I know the uni would basically pause my course, so I wouldn't need to pay any more tuition than I need. But that's still all the money I spend getting out here, living out here for 3 months and renting a place here. But that's almost secondary to actually living a decent life, as long as the money is possible we'll make it work.

3) homework is open in a window of friday-thursady 11:59. you either get 10pts or 0pts. you cant get partial credit. it doesnt matter if you're assigned 32 topics for the week and you do 31. if you dont do 32 you get 0pts. 

4) ALEKS will decide when you need a calculator. also no calculators on the paper quizes ever. 

5) its a M/W/F class. M/W she lectures for 20 mins on a few of the topics then we do hmwk for the rest of class. F we get a 10 point quiz and then group work. in group work we get a packet of unfamiliar problems and we get to teach eachother what to do. (i take issue with this because i have bad anxiety about doing math around people) 

6) if you cant complete your homework you still cant complete those topics. why? well when the next hmwk cycle begins ALEKS locks every unit before it. you have to work to finish early to beable to get to those previous units. 

7) Knowledge checks!!!!! basically, ALEKS sometimes forces you to take a test (that isnt graded for the class by my professor) to make sure you actually learned the topics you completed. if you get a question wrong you have to redo that topic. see 6 for why thats horrible. 

8) if you have less than 4 abscenses you dont have to take the paper final, you can only take the ALEKS comprehensive. when asked about how hard it is Prof deadass says ""oh no one has had to try more than about 5 times."" like...the fuck? 

so. this being said we now arrive to right now. I've talked to my professor 3 seperate times about why this class stresses me out so much, and i ask for just a little bone, just something. maybe an extra day for homework, maybe being allowed to use calculators (im a bit bad at paper add/sub bc i go fast and make dumbass mistakes. i know how to do the algebraic concept but some topics take me hours bc i do small fuck ups), unlocking previous topics so i can be sure im still up to speed, less topics every week (week 1 was 25 tpcs, 2 was 32tpcs, this week was only 13 but they were very tedious and very difficult,), partial credit on hmwk, just...SOMETHING. 

i explained that ive already spent lots of time crying and stressing over this class and its so early in the semester. so she pulls up my student report and saw that last wednesday (week 2) i spent 4.5 hours working, and that i worked on my homwork a bit every single day. she asked me how many credits im taking (15), and when i  answered she simply said that it was my fault im stressed because im probably taking too many classes. i was like??? no???? i need to take 15 a semester to graduate in 2 years (im going for an associate.) i know the content of the class but the amount of work with all these resrictions is what makes this more difficult than even my 4 credit class. 

she didnt care though and she waved me away. this conversation happened about 2 more times after this. im upset and frustrated because im doing my best to make sure i succeede and following the advice of ""talk to professors early! they'll work with you if you're dilligent!""  but she just. doesnt care. it doesn't help that when she DOES actually teach its super grating to listen to because she talks like she's teaching 5th graders. i still do my part and take notes for things i dont know but im at a loss. putting so much focus on this class is fucking with my time management for my other classes' homework because i have to spent such a disproportionate amount of time here. 

ALEKS is also horribly finniky. i typed an answer as 13x-5x^2+13 and got marked wrong because it wanted -5x^2+13x+13. without stating anywhere that answers were ONLY accepted in standard notation. mind you tho, it accepts things like "" 45/9 "" and "" 2/8 "". 

Im currently doing my best but this class is making me despise math all over again, even though i know algebra can be really cool and im actually decent at it. how do i deal with this? should i keep talking to her? I've been thinking of just going to the department head, because im not the only person in this class struggling so much. I'm not withdrawing because i really dont have the money to essentially have wasted on the class and the stupid activation code for ALEKS.

I dropped out of high school due to truancy and proceeded to get a GED from a program suggested by my counselor. After the GED, they gave me an option of getting a free 2 year college degree at a local community college. I took the offer but since nothing has changed; I'm still struggling to keep up.I'm 18 and I'm practically lost. I'm going to college like it's still high school. I don't even know how the tuition process is like since the program I'm in covers it. I'm in constant fear of what will happen once I'm out of the program or would they kick me.

Back to my original question, I at the minimum need 90 credits and a 2.0 GPA to get a transfer degree to a state university. I'm not sure if I shot myself in the foot here or not by taking college level classes and not even dealing with the issues that got my kicked out of high school in the first place. I have a 2.58 GPA currently with 30 credits. I think there are retaking classes but I'm not sure whether or not my program would cover that too. Despite knowing I need to deal with my mental health I still am going to continue taking classes too. I'm not sure what will happen if I pause with the program. Somehow I got a 4.0 GPA in my last class so I would be taking a class with the same professor next quarter. I'm just afraid of not being able to transfer. If I can't, I will be truly lost. My whole goal was to get to a 4 year university and if I fail I don't see myself succeeding in any other way. With an average of 5 credits per class, I really don't have much time to get my GPA to a decent one. My guess is I need at least a 3.5 from what I've seen. I'm in the Seattle area so University of Washington is where I'm really hoping I would be able to transfer to.

I need help deciding if I should take intro to chem (CHE 105) or the continuation of CHE 105 (CHE 107). 

Background on my AP Chem class: My class was a guinea pig since it was the teacher’s first year teaching at an AP level. She did not have a good grasp of the math side of chemistry and did not offer many resources to help retain the information, giving to the fact that she was new at teaching AP Chem. I figured most of the course material out from YouTube, review books, and the hard-to-read textbook. I passed with A’s all year but still feel unconfident in my chemistry knowledge, and that is reflected in my 3 on the test. However, I still tested out of CHE 105. I have a month before university begins and am considering brushing up on my chem knowledge with online resources and such. I’m also open to the possibility of struggling and working hard to pass CHE 107, but I’m not sure how well I will fare considering my schedule/workload. It is my first semester and I don’t want to stress too much...

How were the introductory classes for chem compared to the next chem class? Did you take AP Chem, and how does it compare to college chem courses? Did AP Chem prepare well enough to surpass an intro course?

 I’m stuck between taking CHE 105 (even though I tested out + don’t want to retake a credit I already have) or challenging myself with CHE 107 (I’m unconfident about my success, though).

96,glipglops4life,1561160737,/r/college/comments/c3icuy/help_with_writing_a_personal_statement_returning/,"So 2 years ago I dropped out of college after my grades dropped low enough that I was dropped from the engineering program I was enrolled in.  There are many reasons why this happened. First and foremost is because I let it happen, I did not put in the work and it became a snowball effect. On top of that, I was really struggling with balancing school and finances. I did not have scholarships or financial aid and was not being financially supported by my parents. I was qualified for in-state tuition but it was a large state college in a very expensive city to live in. So I was drowning in debt. I worked a lot of hours and really struggled to keep up with classes, homework, and sleep. I have generalized anxiety and depression which added to the equation. My partner of 5 years had just joined the Marines and shipped out at this crucial time when I was still able to turn my grades around. This left me alone for 9 months trying to manage my mental health, finances, and school on my own.  I was unable to maintain my grades and decided the best course of action was to drop out and get healthy and reevaluate my goals. 

So, I have now decided I am ready to go back to finish my degree at a much more affordable University and live with a family member. I applied recently for the fall semester and was not accepted due to bad grades. I had feared this might happen so my back up plan was to attend a community college for a semester and transfer over to my desired University in the Spring. So I called admissions to see if they could help me find classes that would best transfer over from the community college. However, when I got a hold of admissions they told me that I already have quite a few credits and I should not go to community college. They wanted me to just rewrite my personal statement and talk about what has changed that will make me successful now that I am returning to college.  

I have a general idea of what has changed that will help me succeed which is: maturity, better time management skills, financial stability, I will live with a family member so my living will be much more affordable, stable mental healthcare, I now have a much clearer idea of what my career goals are... 

I just really want to get into this University this fall semester and am looking for guidance on how to write the statement professionally with the most impact.  Are the ideas I have listed out above appropriate for the letter? If so are those reason enough to admit me back? Any suggestions when writing this personal statement?

97,bettermentboss,1557269990,/r/college/comments/blxkjd/7_honest_things_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started/,"So you don’t want to spend $25,000 a year for college just to mess it up and have your life ruined? Great, let me share with you 7 honest things I wish I knew before I started college:

Number 1: You’re going to have to figure things out yourself

In college, there is no more hand holding and this means that your learning will entirely rely upon you. My experience was that in college, once you paid your tuition, having professors care about your academic success is rare, meaning that if you are struggling, you need to find ways to help yourself out. I remember starting university here in Canada and feeling totally overwhelmed in class and when I tried to talk to the professor, he would never make the time to go through my questions leaving me to have to work with his assistants in order to get the support I needed. Therefore, the first thing to know when starting college is that you will have to rely upon yourself in order to succeed.

Number 2: Networking is key

Sure, you signed up for college to party…I mean get a degree well one thing you cannot neglect is networking. Now, I know it is tough. As students, we are in a constant cycle of being bombarded by readings and assignments followed by midterms and finals which leaves little time to consider employment related activities. However, do you want to me the only one of your friends who graduates with no job prospects because you didn’t take the time to build relationships with employers? Therefore, the second thing to know is that networking should be prioritized when in college.

Number 3: Resourcefulness equals success

Honestly, I am not the smartest dude but I am probably one of the most resourceful. Being resourceful for me meant having a few high performing students in each class I could depend on for help on assignments when needed or to have available if I was given a group project to tackle. Alternatively, being resourceful also meant leveraging the school’s free services like resume writing workshops and networking fairs to help me find the best jobs possible. Therefore, the third thing you must know in order to succeed in college is how to leverage the resources around you.

Number 4: You will be judged based on your major

In high school, you were judged for just about everything but lucky for you, in college you will only be judged by one thing: your major. For me, I was always called a bean counter or a numbers nerd by my friends for being in accounting but guess is asking for tax help now…yeah you guessed it! Regardless of what program you are in, as long as you enjoy the subject and see a career path that will result from your hard work then don’t worry when people pass judgment on what major you chose.

Number 5: College is a precious time in your life

College is a fantasy land. You can sleep in during the middle of the week and any night is a good night to party. With that being said, college is still stressful and something you shouldn’t take lightly, but when in college, appreciate being able dedicate yourself to your studies and enjoy the lack of responsibilities that will soon enter your life once you start your career.

Number 6: Your grades don’t matter as much as you think

Sure, you’d love to bring home a good grade for your mom to put on the fridge but in reality your grades in college don’t matter as much as you think. My personal stance on grades in college is that you should try your best get the best marks possible but not at the expense blocking out all the other positive aspects. For instance, if you never attend social events, network or exercise then you are doing yourself a disservice because those grades you are striving to obtain probably won’t mean anything to you in the future. Therefore, the sixth thing you should know before starting college is that your grades matter but they aren’t everything. 

Number 7: Picking a major based on future earnings is wrong

We all want to make it rain but at what expense? I feel fortunate that my career as an accountant has been very enriching but for a surprisingly high amount of graduates, their field of work is not as satisfying as they would have imagined even if it is paying them a fair sum of money. I feel strongly that you should follow your passion when deciding on a major in college because if you love what you do then you will surely become good enough at your craft to support yourself financially. Conversely, if you choose a major based on salary, you may be financially solid but dread each and every day you have to work making your career one long slog. So if you’re deciding on a major right now, keep in mind potential earnings but prioritize your passion for the subject if you want to maximize what you get out of college.

When I first went to college I first went for general studies. then I was introduced to psychology and I fell in love with it. 2 years later I graduated from community college with an associates in psychology/sociology in the Spring semester. At this time I was still passionate about psychology. I started attending a 4 year university during the following Fall semester. At that time I felt myself losing interest in the subject, I didn't really like the atmosphere of the school or the small town it was located in, I was also going through a break up that really had a negative affect on my emotional health. I probably should of taken a break but I continued to go, unfortunately I ended up failing or dropping most of my classes my first semester there. On top of that I was driving 2 hours back and forth everyday since I couldn't afford a place to live. I continued to go for another 2 semesters with no clear idea as to what I wanted to major in. I majoring in English, and medical lab science for a semester each.  

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't take many classes in medical lab science to to my D in college algebra. I decided that to go back to community college to take intermediate algebra so I could be prepared for college algebra. I was eventually successful in attaining a B in college algebra, allowing me take the higher level courses required for my current biology major.  Instead of going back to the previous 4 year school I was able to find one out of state that would charge me in-state tuition that was only a 40 minute drive away. In trying to graduate as quickly as possible I filled my semester with as many classes as I could (I'm starting to feel the burn out). I've been doing well in most of my classes but I am struggling in a few (mainly chemistry, as I find it difficult to split my time between all 6 classes) and I'm sure I'll have to retake them, pushing my time of graduation even further. I'm now confident that I'd like to work in health care field or a tech related.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking for jobs for months now but so far no luck, as I'm tired of my current grocery store job and the pay isn't very good. I've been thinking of getting another associates degree in either applied science: biological and pre-professional sciences or computer information systems to better help me find a job in an area of my interest because job wise my psychology degree has done nothing for me. I already have my general education requirements completed so completing either of those degrees wouldn't take more than 24 credit hours. I have until 2021 before my FAFSA stops paying for college

I'm a first year student at a local private college. Coming from a family where graduating high school is an accomplishment, I'm often praised as being ""the only one with some sense in the family"" for attending college. The first half of this year, I questioned my decision to attend college but figured ""many people must have this thought and I've just gotta push past it"". I passed my first semester with little to no struggling and mildly enjoyed it. After Christmas break, I came back to college and continued but as of late, I don't feel anything but stress. Finding something that brings a smile to my face is rare, and my ""free time"" is spent stressing over what I'm doing with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

 I live in a rural southern state, come from a super poor background, and have to rely on others for a means of transportation. Luckily, I got enough money in scholarships/grants to cover my tuition with a federal loan to cover the tiny bit left over. All my life, I've loved anything computer related, I've dabbled in programming, building, and a lot of repairs for family members but my college doesn't offer anything of this sort. I'm an accounting major, and despite hating it, I'm pushing forward because the action of dropping out would essentially be the equivalent of me preemptively packing my stuff and moving out because I'd be kicked out of my home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trapped in a degree that I don't have interest in, I'm poor, the next closest college is an hour and 30 minutes away and its a community college meaning I don't have any option for housing and even if I did, I'd be unable to cover the housing costs. I've never felt this way before and at night, I find it hard to sleep because I'm worrying about upcoming assignments, my choice in going to college, trying to find other options for education, and many other things.

104,BravoTeam127,1542414333,/r/college/comments/9xrua7/anyone_else_struggling_with_a_professor_that_is/,"I like this professor. He's smart and teaches an interesting class.

That said, he is awful at teaching this class. He doesn't have a book, so the only materials to review for his exams are his lectures and his slides. Both are just so cringey. 

His slides are a shit show. Randomly organized, repeating facts and definitions in random spots, just so confusing to try to follow. His lectures are about the same. He lectures like he doesn't really know for sure what he is saying and kind of wants us to agree with what he has to say almost to be validated. 

That said, I feel for the guy. This class is part of a completely new program taught not very closely in this departments focus. It is an artsy class taught in the business school. 

He pissed me off so bad on my last exam though. His exams are also horribly organized. He has the normal 'choose a, b, c, or d' questions, but for some reason he mixes in these random 'choose all that apply' questions that look exactly the same. Like only difference is those four words at the very end in the exact same font. He'll also put in random fill in the blank questions as well. 

Now I am already tolerating this class to a point because I really feel like it is low quality and not worth my tuition. I am never disrespectful or anything in class. It's kind of like a just get it done and over with class. During the class after the exam we were discussing the exam. There is only like 12 of us in the class. I asked about the 'choose all that apply' questions. I asked him if he could bold that part or move those questions to be in sequence so it is not so confusing. This professor then calls me out and says, ""No, I will leave it for all of the adults in the room who read the whole question."" 

What a dick move, right? I mean I am not calling him out on shitty teaching, shitty slides, or anything else and he just goes out and makes a demeaning comment out of nowhere?! WTF. Never had such an immature reaction in my 4 years of schooling.

105,snicker_pups,1541459116,/r/college/comments/9uio3p/it_feels_as_if_nothing_is_working_out_in_my_favor/,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I am a second year mechanical engineering student at a university in the south (we'll call it U1) with hopes of transferring to a more prestigious and widely recognized school (making this U2). I had attempted to enroll at U2 straight out of high school, as I had more than sufficient test scores, but my GPA wasn't high enough due to me not taking high school seriously until the 11th/12th grade. I'm not upset about this, as I just figured I would complete a year or two at U1 and apply to U2 as a transfer student.

The problem is that I'm no longer sure I want to transfer. Between the great group of people I know at U1, along with the many great memories I've made so far, I'm starting to change my mind. The ME program at U1 is also decently reputable and definitely challenging enough. 

However, U2 is a much ""better"" school. The ME program, student life, location, prestige, and opportunities in general are all miles above those of U1. It has been my dream school for the longest time, yet I don't know if I'm cut out for it. Plus, my family and friends all know I have plans to transfer, so I feel as if I would let them down if I stayed at U1. 

To top it all off, the stress of trying to get into the classes I need is tearing me up. My time to register for classes in the spring of 2019 starts four days after first time slots. Four. Days. There go all the seats in the classes I need.

Oh, and not to mention the stress of living at home. My family is in the process of moving out of state so I had to move back home to help fix up the house before selling in December of this year. I will be staying in-state to keep tuition costs low, meaning I need to find an apartment, and where I plan to go to school dictates where I'll rent. But since I can't decide what I want to do with my schooling, I haven't even begun the apartment search, leaving me less than two months to make these decisions.

I just feel like I'm struggling. My GPA is slipping this semester at U1. I don't really leave the house because the commute to campus and my friends is too costly to make more than the two times a week I already am. My fitness level has decreased since I'm no longer motivated to go the gym. And lastly, my diagnosed depression of more than six years continues to get worse. 

Overall, I'm just a wreck. I don't want to come across as entitled or whiny, as I know there are others who have it much worse than I do. Frankly, I've been given some really great opportunities, and I'm truly thankful for them. But at the moment, I feel like I'm stuck in a rut with nothing appearing to fall into place for me like it seemingly does for my peers.

108,WangChoBo,1539275395,/r/college/comments/9nbhls/how_far_should_i_go_with_reporting_a_roommate/,"Hey all, Freshmen living in dorms here.

I wouldn't be complaining/reporting if there wasn't another friend who wants to move in here but my current roommate is making me extremely anxious.

Before moving in here, I had the opportunity to check out his instagram and the shit he posts made me extremely scared of me him. Since I'm an international student, I'm not entirely sure if it is a big deal or not but he has pictures and videos of him doing excessive amounts of weed and codeine. I didn't want to switch rooms as soon as I got to the dorms since my suitemates are extremely cool.

Just to list things off, he never goes to class. 3 absences result in instant failure. Its like week 7 now and I have no idea how he didn't get kicked out already. He sleeps all fucking day. He never gets out of bed till around 5/6 PM. He leaves immediately and comes back drunk and/or high at around 6AM. He's really loud when he comes back and he has his alarm go off at 7:30AM and it doesn't shut up till like 7:40/50. This doesn't particularily bother me until I have my day off since I usually wake up at 7; although I want to sleep in during my off days and it's getting even more stressful as midterms are coming up. 

I go to a school with a small population of 1000 students, so they're especially strict with alcohol and drugs on campus. And this guy brings 3 bottles of smirnoff in and puts it in the fridge and leaves it there. I eventually told him to remove it.

He once brought a drunk friend from high school reeking of cigarettes around 6AM and he then proceeds to sleeps on our couch with our guest blanket. They both wake up at like 3PM and my roommate leaves him in our room and he just stays there.

We have a roommate agreement saying that if we're going to have overnight guests, a majority of us should know beforehand. In addition, we also stated that we are going to clean the room every weekend. He's never herr during the weekends. My suitemates and I are the only ones whos been cleaning and he never shows up to clean. Oh and I also usually clean up after his mess whenever he comes home drunk. I would usually not clean it up but this fucking snorlax doesn't clean up afterhimself. And all the things he leaves behind bothers me so much throughout the day because it's in the way. 

I can't even complain directly to him because I'm so very intimidated by him and he's never awake. If he is, he's never here or my suitemates and I are asleep.

Oh and he also smoked in the room once, which is a giant nono in this campus.

I realize that he's not the worst roommate. I realize I can deal with him with only like 2 months left of the 1st semester. But seeing him and his actions stresses me out so much since he's just throwing away so much tuition money, meal plans (which he almost never uses), and also dormatory fees while my family is struggling so much just so I can go to this school. 

Now that there's a close friend who has his own problems within his dorm and wants to move in and replace him, I really want to report him. But I have no clue what to include and what to omit. I kinda don't want to completely rat him out as well because I just want to switch rooms with him.

Thank you for your time for reading this.

I’m currently struggling with parents in the middle of a nasty divorce - my mom is paying for community college tuition and helping me take out loans when I transfer next year, but my dad does not believe he has a responsibility to pay whatsoever. Neither of them set up a college fund for me and have no savings for it. 

It’s affecting things negatively, i.e. I’m now unable to visit my school (cross country) more than once before I attend because of costs. My parents both believe I am acting entitled and selfish for thinking if my dad isn’t paying for my tuition, he can at least pay for a cross country trip to help me out. My dad thinks I’m entitled and selfish in general to want him to pay for tuition. 

Both of them cite my age at 22 (worked full time and never moved out before this) as reason that I’m not entitled to anything. My mom is still paying, but my dad refuses. 

Has anyone dealt with this? Is there anything besides loans you did to help you out to support yourself? I’m working two part times while taking classes now, and actively seeking scholarships... is there anything else?

110,nilsamurai,1537520776,/r/college/comments/9hnq5a/dropping_out_of_college_indefinitely/,"**This is gonna be LOOONG and detailed. But if you have time and choose to do so, I would appreciate a read, with any advice you might have.**

I went from being a first year student in an intensive four-year biochemistry program at an undergraduate christian university to taking two really easy classes at my local community college. I also had my first panic attack in college after deciding this. During my first year of college I made a lot of good friends, *failed pretty much every class I had,* learned way more about myself and how I think then ever before, changed my spiritual/philosophical views pretty hard, and gradually changed from the optimistic/relaxed person I had always been, into a depressed and anxious individual. 

Now I work 20-30 hours a week at a local Wendy's and am a part time student at my community college. I'm unsure of what I want to do, but I've changed my dream from biochemistry researcher to psychotherapist. I love science, love music, and enjoy helping people through their emotional problems. I think I've found the right thing for me at last, but after having a rather terrible start to this semester (skipping classes, not doing homework, several all nighters, etc.) I think that I just can't work with the academic world until I have my mental/personal issues worked out. 

Also even after finally taking my ADHD seriously for the first time in my life, my psychiatrist hasn't really done much to help me (ok the meds were nice I'll admit), nor do I think he will do anything more. He says he thinks I should seek a psychotherapist (weird how that works out) and I'm currently looking for one right now.

So I want to officially get out of academia and work full time, until I'm ready to go back to college. **If that's enough information for you, then go ahead and comment, but if you want some more info on the situation, feel free to look at a LOOOONG list of pros and cons I typed out.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 1. I owe nearly 20,000 in student loans that I'm currently paying a small interest off of. Both the government and state of New Jersey will spike up the interest rates on my loans like crazy (ok really more the state of NJ, man this state sucks) if I don't attend a college at least part time.           

2. I can't get a refund anymore for this fall semester, I owe what I owe and I have to finish paying off my payment plan (at least its a community college tuition and not uber expensive private christian university tuition) whether I finish the semester until December or not.

3. Let us address the fact that I am an impulsive, anxious person that turns things into nightmare scenarios and always looks for the easiest way out, usually by quitting. 

4.My career goals will become ever farther and harder to reach. I'm nervous about delaying my future career into the unforeseeable future.

**Pros:** 1. Even though I LOVE the material in these classes (General Psychology and Music History) It's been a terrible semester already and it's just started, it would be stupid to not recognize I'm worse off than before and need to bail NOW. 

2. I have a steady job that I really like and have a great relationship with my coworkers and managers. 

3. I could work more rather than study and so pay off those loans quicker over time. 

4. I've been dealing with a lot of personal/spiritual stuff so its no wonder things are going bad, my mind is in too many places. And that's already its default mode so my thinking has been getting REALLY out there now.

5. I've been ignoring hobbies I love, like reading philosophy and science, running (I used to love to run my brains out, but now I'm an unhealthy sofa spud), playing music, hanging out with friends, and dedicating much needed time to my family. Maybe that's why it seems my depression has only been getting worse. I did the same stuff last year in college as well. Completely ignoring everything I liked doing and trying (but failing) to focus everything on work/school.

6. I haven't even come close to figuring out how to manage my ADHD, how to study, or other stuff that I should learn properly to become an adult. Struggling with school is only gonna slow that down, if not make it worse. Me not having managed my ADHD also makes me struggle with school even more. Fun viscous cycle there right?

7. My future is pretty undetermined, really. I don't HAVE to go to college, get a degree, and start my lifelong career. I don't have to even stick to this career as I move on in life. I recognize that there are more important things to me and I can change who I am whenever the time is right, whenever I want.

I’m sorry, this might get long. Currently, it’s 1:40 in the morning and I feel like blowing my brains out. I’ve been working on an essay/presentation for 5 hours and am nowhere near done but I’m so stressed I just want to give up and take the zero but I can’t. 

A little background: I’m in the honors program because it’s the only way I can afford to go to my community college. I’m taking four classes and on top of that working full time for my families vending business.

Life fucking sucks right now. I have to perform well in school to stay in the honors program or I won’t have enough money to pay the tuition fees which wouldn’t be a problem for me if it wasn’t for my parents. Last semester I didn’t have to work much and breezed through my four classes without a grade under a 96%. This semester I’m struggling to get just one A. My parents are struggling financially and it’s completely their fault yet they’re blaming me.

My parents fucking suck with money. They will sit me down and tell me I’m not working enough and the family is struggling financially and it’s my fault but that same week take a trip to California. My mom doesn’t have a job and offers to get one but my dad won’t let her because that extra $1000 a much in his words, “Won’t help with shit.” So while I’m trying to help with bills, I’m also taking a full schedule at school, trying to pay for my car, and trying to find insurance for my car because they dropped me from our insurance. My dad also hurt his back a couple weeks ago and still can’t do almost a thing so now I’m the only person that can work the business which involves servicing vending machines at over 450 locations across three states.

Isn’t this just fucking fantastic? I feel like I’m actually losing my mind guys. I’m sorry about ranting so much but I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this because my problems are my family.

113,sushiandtacos,1523561762,/r/college/comments/8bsyt8/trying_to_transfer_out_of_my_second_college/,"Hello everyone,

I'm trying to look for a new college at this point. Credit-wise, I am a senior but I checked with my school and because I wasted my time on major switches, failing classes, and taking too many lower-level credits, I accumulated 113 credits at my current institution.

I used to be a fairly good student. My graduation GPA at the community college was a 3.6 with an Honors Diploma. After I arrived at this school, it took a nosedive and I have a 2.2 GPA at the school (3.2 Cumulative GPA)... and for the first time in my academic career, I have been unhappy with school. I am currently taking the semester off, but I have so many complaints about the school I currently attend that I want to leave. I don't want to list them all because it'd be a longer read than a Stephen King book.

I was looking into how many credits it would take to complete my degree. I have 113 credits right now. I need 160 credits from that school to graduate, because I took too many ""junk"" courses that, for the most part, do not transfer anywhere else in the nation (I checked).

I am seriously considering leaving this school before I give them anymore of my money. There's a dissonance between the school's focus versus my career focus and my focus on my future. My career goals and college priorities are much different from when I initially transferred. When I first transferred to this school, I was just looking at the social scene and the quality of on-campus resources (there are many; this is a LARGE school). Now, I have a list of things I'd like to see in my next college:

1	Prepare me for a career in voice acting/music/anything that could give me an income stream
2	A program that allows non-majors to take acting courses and/or an *actual* chance to audition for their plays
3	A program with tutoring services; that will help me when I am struggling in classes
4	Decent Professors that are actually successful in their field and are not just using teaching as an income stream because their other career choice failed
5	Professors that want to see students succeed and will go above and beyond to assist them
6	A program in a thriving acting market in Florida where I can audition for projects or take classes outside of school
7	A program in a city or a suburb right by a city
8	A program that allows me flexibility of schedule
9	A Career Services Center that provides opportunities for me to work in the entertainment industry, either through internships, co-ops, job shadows, or jobs.
10	A college that will fully accept my A.A. as my Gen-Eds but give me the option to not transfer any credits from UCF altogether
11	I would strongly prefer a public college within the state of Florida. That way, I can take advantage of in-state tuition and lower costs
12	The freedom to explore the business side of the entertainment industry so I can prepare for what's to come.
13	A program that allows me the opportunity to get training in a flexible survival job
14	Coursework that is relevant to what I want to do

Some of this criteria should seem obvious. Obviously, you have no idea what kind of insanity I've been through.

I've used up almost 2.5 years of my financial aid. I'm really scared at the possibility of losing it, or worse, that I may needs to take over 160 credits to graduate. My GPA is too low so I can't apply for scholarships like I used to. The state of Florida requires 45 upper-level credits and I only have 3 usable upper-level credits. My GPS from the first institution was a 3.6, my GPA from this current college is a 2.2, and my overall is a 3.2 GPA. I failed 3 classes; two that won't transfer anywhere else. 

I acknowledge that I royally screwed up on many levels when first choosing a transfer school... big time. I want a chance to fix that. I'm concerned about tuition so I feel like I have to stay in Florida and attend a public university. 

So: What are my options Is there any way that I could transfer just the credits from the first college I went to but not the second, even after submitting it? At this point, I want those credits from the second institution gone. It's junk that won't apply towards anything. Do you know of any good vocational/trade schools in either Miami or Orlando, in case there's nothing for me? What are my options looking like? Can anyone give me some advice?

I'm in my third year of college. I'm studying Biology. I've been doing poorly in college for the past three years. My GPA right now is a 2.8. Semester after semester I keep making the same mistakes. I procrastinate, I get distracted, I put off assignments, homework, reading, etc. I know I shouldn't do this and I tell myself each semester, ""Okay I'm going to do things differently this semester, I don't want to make the same mistakes in the past."" However, I go right back to my old habits of procrastination, not studying, and not doing my work.

I find the reason why I keep doing this is because I'm not motivated. Instead of studying or doing my homework, I would rather watch YouTube videos or surf the internet. When I know I have an exam coming up in the next two or three weeks I tell myself, ""Oh I have plenty of time to study, I'm good."" I end up wasting a lot of time, and the weeks fly by. Then I find myself two days before the exam, not prepared and not have studied. I get too comfortable knowing that I have a lot of time to study, then time flies by. Instead of studying, I do other things. When I fail exams, I don't even feel that bad about it because it has become a bad habit.

I feel horrible because my mother asks, how am I doing in my classes. I lie and tell her I'm doing well, because I'm too afraid to tell her I'm doing poorly. She's going to be pissed because I keep making the same mistakes, and she took out a loan to cover my tuition. She's going to feel like she is wasting her money.

The reason why I'm doing poorly is because I don't really want to be in school right now. I want to take time off to sort out what I want to do with my life. The only thing that's keeping me from doing that is my student loans will start to go in repayment, and I would lose grant money from my school. They can't defer their grants. I lost my scholarship twice for not being able to maintain the GPA requirement.

I had a 3.9 GPA in high school and was number seven of my class. Now I'm struggling in college. High school was easy, but college isn't. I believe I wasn't ready for college and it's reflecting in my GPA.

I don't know what I should do. I don't want to keep doing poorly in my classes, and being further in debt. So what should I do?

I'm a 24 year old (turning 25) college student looking for some advice. I got accepted into college at 18. 

A short little backstory:
I abused and was addicted to a couple of different prescription medications during my early years in college. I somehow managed to go to school/class while being high off these prescription drugs (I lived on campus). I wasn't high 24/7 but was frequently taking medication recreationally.

I got into a big car accident and it changed my life. I took a leave of absence from school for two years, left the country, and recently came back. 
I deeply regret the decisions that I made but now I've got to live with them. I've made peace with my demons and have salvaged a majority of the relationships I destroyed. 

On the bright side, 
I’ve come back to the states with a new found motivation in life and wanted to continue my education at my college! The thing is... my overall GPA is horrific and I've been on ""early academic warning"" since the end of my 2nd year of college (low gpa warning). You can only imagine the amount of studying I was getting done with the amount of partying I was doing. I'm not proud of it. 

I only have a couple more units to take to graduate..but school is harder than ever. I find myself struggling and having a difficult time understanding some of the material. I honestly don't know how I made it this far and am quite surprised I hadn't dropped out of school while I was taking all those drugs. 
I'm in a sticky situation now. I'm struggling in my courses right now and have no margin for error left. I have very little leeway when it comes to failing another course... I'm honestly even too scared/nervous to talk to advisor about this. 

Can I salvage anything? Am I just wasting my time? Should I just drop out? Can I ever go back to school even with my horrific transcript?

I’ve attempted suicide during the first week of first year, and have been struggling with depression and mental health issues ever since. My cumulative GPA is around 2.5, and I am struggling this semester with only 2 courses. At the start of this year, I was so determined to start getting As in everything and just killing it all-around. However, due to my mental health issues, I'll be really, really lucky to get Bs or B-‘s after my finals. I am so worried that this is a poor investment for my parents. I've thought about dropping out and working, just to pay back my parents for spending so much money on my mediocre grades.

I'm always looking for part-time jobs, and am planning on doing an internship to pay for school myself. After I graduate, I will pay back all the debt myself, which will be made slightly easier by the fact that I don't want kids or a family.

I calculated that I can still graduate with at least a 3.1 cumulative GPA, and a major GPA of around 3.5. I really love my subject, and I want to graduate with my degree. And without trying to make any excuses, I feel like my health issues played a pretty big role in my failures. I’m confident that, if I can manage my health, then I can succeed like any other student. Nevertheless, I constantly worry about making my parents poor.

If I am indeed just wasting my parents’ money, just tell it to me straight. It’s a constant source of guilt for me.",college,"Parents are paying for school, feels like I'm stealing from them",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7hppo7/parents_are_paying_for_school_feels_like_im/,1512499194.0

I'm a junior at the university I'm attending, and I can not stand it anymore. There have been a lot of things leading up to this and I guess I'd like to vent/here some ideas on how I can make it better.
The reason I chose my university was because it was as far away from home as possible. I have some extended family around who are lovely, but my immediate home life wasn't great before I came here. School was always tough for me due to my learning disabilities, which went undiagnosed and untreated due to my parents stubbornness. Anyways, I moved here very excited and with a very positive attitude. My university has turned out to be... Less than. So far, I've had multiple professors where the university has refunded tuition and wiped student records if they failed because they've been so terrible. In my labs, we use shoddy equipment and broken glassware. Mental health support is there but so many students need it that there's no space so I go to off campus counseling.
My social life here has also been not so great. I've tried making friends but have been through a couple friend groups. I do my best to be friendly, but usually end up feeling like I've been taken advantage of. I tend to see others as a threat since I've come here. Ive been having a lot of trouble understanding this since I used to be social butterfly, and didn't have issues making and keeping friends.
My first few semesters were fine, but things have taken a turn for the worse. I've been having trouble with self harm, depression, anxiety, you name it. I can't find any motivation to care about my classes, but I know taking a break would lead to me never coming back. To be completely honest, I'd love to quit and never even hear the word ""college"" again. How can I make finishing this easier on myself? I'd also like to know if anyone has been in my situation and how did they deal with it?

120,michiharuharu,1509639498,/r/college/comments/7aclfl/do_you_think_university_scholarships_you_are/,"I'm thinking this may be a controversial topic, but hear me out. I'm talking about big scholarships like ones that are full ride or 50% of tuition that you are awarded your freshman year based on high school grades and honors. For example, in high school you could have had a 4.0 gpa and been apart of a ton of extracurriculars, so your college awards you with a full ride scholarship. However, the only stipulation to keep the scholarship is to keep your college cumulative gpa higher than a 3.0 and do a few volunteer hours. 

I ask this question mainly due to my friend and my college's budget cuts. I think colleges should look at more than just gpa for you to keep your university scholarship. Due to budget cuts, my college is offering less and less each year to students, yet still provides full rides to students who may not deserve it anymore. Yes this might sound harsh, but please listen. 

My friend was awarded a full ride scholarship her freshman year based on her high school grades. It's now her junior year and she's barley keeping the required gpa for her full ride. She complains about not having money because she spends it all on alcohol, but refuses to get a job and makes fun of people who are balancing school and work to pay for their schooling. She also complains about the required volunteer hours that she needs to fulfill to keep her scholarship. Additionally, she's majoring in something she keeps telling me she doesn't know what to do with since it's not going to get her a job. All of her classea are online except two this semester. The classes she has in person don't take attendance, so she hasn't been to class in nearly two weeks. However, she complains how tired she is when she does have to go to her 10am class for an hour. She isn't grateful for her scholarship at all. I'm not saying I should get it. I have my own scholarship, but I do know of others who are struggling to pay for their schooling.

On of my friends is double majoring and also cut ties with her abusive family. They won't help her pay for college anymore, so she's on her own and working full time on top of school. Someone else I know is an engineering major and he's studying non stop to keep his grades up in hopes of possibly getting a bigger scholarship all the while he's working which is cutting into his studying. These are just two examples, but because of cuts, I know there are more in the same situation.

I just think colleges should look at more than just gpa to determine if students should keep their full ride scholarship after freshman year.

I'm a 24 year old Biomedical Engineering student with a full time night job. I work 1-9am and go to school during the day. I'm currently taking 7 credits (it was 11; I'll get into that).

I've found through trial and error that about 9 credits is all I can handle while working full time, especially since most of my classes involve labs, so that's basically like another class. I'm finding it hard to concentrate due to mental illness, also I just moved out of my parents' house in July, so I'm struggling to find a routine.

Hence why I was taking 11 credits this semester, but dropped one class. This particular class is very demanding, and does involve a lab. Also, the lecture portion was from 5:30-6:45, which is normally when I'm sleeping (I usually sleep from 4-midnight), so I was falling asleep in almost every class. I was marked as ""at risk of failing"" due to a low midterm grade. I figured there was no way I could redeem this, so I figure I'll take it next semester.

My problem is, is it worth it to keep working full time if it means taking less classes (and being in school until I'm 30)? I actually like how I'm doing it, I'm not overly stressed, I still get the money I need for rent, food, bills, etc, and I still have a life. I actually enjoy school, so being here longer doesn't really bother me.

But I've had multiple coworkers (who all have degrees) tell me that pushing through, going full time, and getting it done is the best way to go, either because 1) it's cheaper because tuition goes up every year, 2) because I'll start to see the same people in my major and make friends, which is essential to success in college, or 3) I'll get out of my current workplace and make better money sooner (I've been here for three years and there's no room for advancement, plus my yearly raises are starting to get smaller and smaller because I'm making more money and corporate doesn't want to pay me more). A couple of them have suggested multiple times that I should go part time at work and focus on school, but I'm afraid that I won't have enough money to pay my bills (I'm already struggling and I'm still full time, but that could be because of the move and trying to settle into a new lifestyle).

Regardless of this, I went in bound and determined to have a good experience and make the most of out it. My university is a 4 year college with around 3,000 students, and officials told me this would be a good fit for me because of the tight knit community and rigorous academics. I have Autism, dyscalculia (learning disability in math), Generalized anxiety disorder, and depression, so I wanted to believe this. I tried to make friends at orientation, joining clubs, interacting with people in class, or talking to others online from my college with no dice. Everyone found their group during orientation or within the first month, I didn't.


I had a doctor's note describing my disabilities and that I needed accomadation, but the school decided to put me with a roomate anyway (THEY EVEN TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WANTED PROFIT) , and I hated it. It took them a month, and multiple visits to the school health center, for them to switch me to a suite with 2 others, and I couldn't get along with them either. They are close friends who were comfortable with the doors having no lock, and the shower being out in the open with no door, and were constantly sitting right outside my door. I tried to stay there for a few weeks, tried to force myself to adjust- doctor even put me on a cocktail of anxiety meds to try and help me be able to live there, but I couldn't. Dorm life is not for autistic people. I have a childhood friend that I have known for over 6 years that I stay with off campus, which is what I wanted to do originally, but the school said no, cause my tuition would have been free without the dorm fee! I've been trying for over a month to get a job but I don't think anywhere will hire me because the school makes me park my car 2 miles away- even though I have a note saying I need access to go to doctors appointments. I can't get hired on campus either.


No one on campus is very friendly outside of their preestablished cliques, clubs are largely inactive, or meet very late at night. One club meets from 9pm to 2 am on saturdays, and if I wanted to be in it, they told me I would have to come every single Saturday or I wouldn't be allowed to participate. 2/3 of the school commutes anyway, and no one cares about doing anything on campus, not even the freshman who they force to live there. I tried to do club sports, but I'm the only beginner and don't fit in, I don't think anyone likes me anyway cause I'm awkward. No one wants to be my friend. I don't think my professors like my either with the exception of one.


I'm in honors, and only taking one honors class, but the general ed classes are extremely hard, and worse than my honors class! I took AP in high school, so I expected difficulty, but not as much as I am facing. For one, no one here seems to care that I have a learning disability. I am going to math tutoring for hours almost every day except one every week, doing all of my homework multiple times until I get 100%, studying my ass off, only to barely make a C. I don't get extra test time, and I am barely able to scrape by. I cry because my math class stresses me out so bad. I want to major in computer science, so I thought maybe my programming class would be my solace, but it is just as difficult. No one knows what they're doing, I've tried to reach out to others in my class and they don't know how to do the assignments or are just googling them. My professor is only in his office when I have other classes, and I will probably have to sacrifice some of my math tutoring time to start going to computer science tutoring because I am so lost, we are moving so fast and no one can do the work that is assigned.


I go to counseling every week, I'm on antidepressants, and I'm trying so hard but nothing gets better.

123,sludgerants,1506922569,/r/college/comments/73qyt2/should_i_transfer_colleges/,"I'm currently a freshman attending Kennesaw State University in Georgia. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering and my school has a fairly good program for it. I'm pretty sure this major is what I want to stick with, but I'm contemplating transferring to the University of Georgia. I'm curious to know what others think based on my perspective.


Basically, for what I want to do, I'm in a pretty good place. My program is ABET accredited (which is pretty much a necessity for engineering programs), and it offers Aeropsace engineering as well which I think I'd like to minor in. You may be asking why I'd want to transfer. Here is a list of the reasons:


For one, my girlfriend goes there. Before anyone is quick to judge me or says I should pursue my career and not a girl, just hear me out. This girl is the one. I really love her and at some point she is the girl I plan to marry, start a family with, and spend the rest of my life with. We have been dating for almost two years and this is as real as it gets. Even if I don't transfer, we will still stay together. Transferring just will make us both much happier and make managing our relationship much easier. Although this is probably the biggest reason, it's not the only one.


UGA also has a Mechanical Engineering program. It's very new and not yet ABET accredited, but will likely be before I graduate (they are seeking the accreditation next year). It's also a big name school and I'm sure I'll still get a quality education even if it's a step down for me academically; however, they don't offer aerospace engineering as a major or minor and I'm interested in possibly getting a pilot license when I get older as aviation has always interested me.


Another pro to transferring, however, is that I'm struggling with feelings of sadness and depression a lot here. The campus of the university I live on and take my classes on is depressing. No one is social, I don't really have any friends after months of being here and don't think I'll ever really find anyone I'm compatible to be friends with, and I'm just overall lonely and miss my girlfriend (going back to first reason I want to transfer). This wouldn't be the case at UGA. I'm not a huge party person (it's a party school for those who don't know), but I have my girlfriend and other friends there as well as be able to likely make more friends which I don't see happening here. The people here just aren't my people.


The next reason is just that; I can't see myself here for another 4 years. Sure this school has a few perks such as cost, closeness to home, and a better program for my major, but it has so many drawbacks as well.


Overall, if this was too long and you didn't want to read it or if you just need something more concise to see:


PROS:


- I will be happier
- My girlfriend will be happier
- The food is better
- I won't be sad or depressed
- It's a big name school that will still offer a useful degree in my field (assuming it becomes accredited)


CONS:


- Overall tuition and costs is more expensive
- I will be farther away from home
- The mechanical engineering program is newer, not yet ABET accredited (although I am fairly certain it will be soon well before I graduate), and slightly worse than KSU's


In conclusion, I just feel like there is more to college than just building a foundation for a career. I know choices I make now will affect my future, but I need a social future and relationships too, not just a career and a job. I consider that just as important especially because I only have one life and can only experience my undergrad years once. I think I'm willing to sacrifice a little more money and a little better engineering program for that. I'm still questioning myself though and it's a big decision and I just am looking to see someone else's perspective. Am I being level-headed or is this a completely ridiculous thought? Any feedback at all is appreciated.

124,Aer0_FTW,1505063081,/r/college/comments/6z9f05/should_i_stay_at_my_schools_branch_campus_or_go/,"Hey Reddit,

Currently I am a first semester freshman at a Penn State branch campus studying IST (Information Science and Technology). Originally, I was planning on staying here all 4 years but after being here for a few weeks I'm not so certain. It's really hard to make friends here as it's a commuter school, and the IST major isn't exactly what I want. IST is the only major at this campus I'm at all interested in, but I'm more into more in depth stuff (computer science) but I couldn't place high enough in math for that. 

I recently found out that my school has a BS of Computational Data Science which sounds right up my alley and the entrance to major requirements are attainable, unlike pure CS. The problem here is cost. The major is only offered at the main campus, which would be quite a bit more expensive. Tuition here is around 13k for lower level classes, and 15k for upper level (my family and I are already struggling to pay even this, fucking religious private school tuition. Maxed out federal loans aren't enough). Main campus on the other hand, is around 20k, and that's not including room and other fees. Only way I'd be able to afford main campus would be lots of private loans, as my parents are refusing to take out parent loans and they really can't help at all with payment, due to the aforementioned private schools. I'm not going to hedge my bets on scholarships as they are a crapshoot but I'll sure as hell apply. 

TLDR: Do I stay at my current branch campus and do a major I'm not completely interested in, or do I swap majors to Data Science and go to main campus but have to take out substantial private loans for increased tuition and board?

My parents and I pay for my tuition. We've never paid for it on time and have sometimes had to take out loans to pay for it. In the fall/winter 2016/2017 we experienced a major setback, so much so that mom put her studies on hold. I had to take out a loan to pay for the majority of my own tuition. 


Family and I decided that I was going to transfer to the local university which has my program and would be a fine fit. Then proceeded to change our minds when I became more involved with my school by going Greek (Family and I made the decision to transfer literally the day after I invested non-refundable money to join, so at that point, I had to follow through). Just one issue: I decided to not apply when I was on-campus (which is given priority) so now I will have to apply through general housing. This is a huge gamble where housing is not guaranteed. Housing is the biggest portion of my tuition (over half) and the hardest to pay off. I don't want to continue having financial issues. 


Which is why, regardless of whether I get a space before the year starts, I'm considering staying home and commuting round trip (2-3 hours one way) twice a week.


**Pros:**

*Can work in my hometown, so I can make more money

*Would have my own space, instead of maybe (not likely) getting a single on campus or a double with a complete stranger

*Everything would be more accessible to me because I'd have a car at home

*Saving money ($4-6k)

*Would use study spaces of local and community colleges

*Mom could finish her degree because of the saved money


**Cons:** 

*Farther from my greek org which will definitely need me (only 2 other people) 

*Would most likely be tired from the commute

*Social life would indeed tank

*Losing independence by living with my family


You can definitely see that I'm pro-staying home. Please let me know what you think! Especially if you have cons I didn't list here.


TL;DR: Room &amp; Board is like $6k a semester. I'm cheap. I can't see that being worthwhile at all knowing that we would definitely be struggling financially with it. I had a issue with signing up for priority housing so now it's a gamble that I would even get a space on campus at this point. Am considering taking the train which is 2-3 hrs one way twice a week for school at least for the fall to save some money. I know I'll miss out socially but I'm a senior so that's not a huge issue anymore. I'd be saving $4k a semester. Refer to above pros and cons. Are there huge issues I'm overlooking? Help?!

I am a 17 year old girl who's current plan is to go to college out of state. I am moving to the state where my college is and living with my mother who is already there (however I will not be receiving in state tuition, that's besides the point). The price is hefty (39,000 a year for tuition + room and board + personal expenses) and my both of my parents don't qualify for a Parent Plus Loan. The most money my family will get to pay for college is $5000. I've applied for scholarships and despite being a minority women going into the STEM field and being a first generation college student I did not win any of the scholarships I applied to lol. Anyways my point being is that paying for college is a problem for my family that we don't have a solution for.

I've already talked to my family about potentially not going to college this fall. It's not for sure since we're still looking at options as to how we're going to pay and potentially getting another family member to cosign the loan. Anyways I'm really considering taking a gap year and just working and volunteering. I would also like to do some tutoring too.

I want to make myself more productive and get more experiences. Also I'm young, very young for a graduating senior and freshmen in college. I'm not even an adult yet (and I won't be until this September) and I'm not sure I'm ready for the commitment of college. I've been struggling with depression and mostly very severe anxiety this past year also and I really want to do something with my life that will make me happy now that I'm done with high school and I have the freedom to do so.

However the cons of a gap year are what's preventing me from going through with this. While my plan is to work, volunteer, and be productive I know myself, and I know that I am lazy person. I can see myself falling behind and not keeping up with my own education. I am afraid that I will miss out on an education and this gap year will turn into 2 years and I just won't end up going to school. I was also thinking about taking a semester off or so after my first two years of college, which I read was beneficial to some. I really do not want to go to a CC because I really want the freshmen experience at a college and I don't want to transfer in as a junior anywhere. I feel like if I took a gap year it'd be alright because I would be the age of most of the kids coming in.

Anyways thanks for reading that and as you can see I'm really conflicted. This has been a subject of stress but I know things are going to work out for me. I would just like other opinions.

I just finished my sophomore year of college at my local university. All of my classes have gone to three different majors, none of which have been ""right"" for me. I never had the motivation to do well throughout my entire educational career before college, and I still have no motivation or direction.              
                
I started doing an art degree but quickly decided to switch because of the bad job market for that. Changed to CS but switched from that because, despite my love of computers, I really hated even the entry classes. I then made a rash and not well thought out decision to start Electrical Engineering, despite struggling very hard with math and science throughout high school. I thought I could just ""struggle"" through it with hard work and dedication replacing actual aptitude. Went pretty terribly. I literally can't force myself to pay attention/concentrate even when my future depends on it. I get so easily distracted by anything.                 
                
At this point I don't know what to do. I feel like I've squandered these two years of time and tuition. I'm looking at a couple options but these still might be terrible, but what else do I do?                 
              
- *English major*            
    I've always been skilled at writing/reading, english classes have been the only ones I've done well in through high school and college. I'd like to maybe get a job writing in some capacity, or even go on to grad school and become a professor/teacher. *However* almost everything I read online is about how English degrees are a terrible idea and that everyone should go STEM. What are your thoughts on this? What if I'm too dumb for STEM?              
                 
- *Programming associates degree at local CC*             
     I'm wary of doing this because I've never been skilled at picking up programming, despite my interest in it. This would purely be to at least have *some* sort of degree that I could get a job with, instead of nothing.          
                
             
Thanks for reading, I'd very much like to hear your advice on what I should do. I feel lost, I feel like a failure, and I'm very worried about my future especially because I should be two years from graduating, and at this point I'm still basically 4 years away.            
             
**Tl;dr:** Wasted two years in college on 3 different majors, failed at all of them. Lost, don't know what do to.

Couple weeks ago I decided to study EE in SUNY Buffalo because of the low expenses there and the tuition is low, however, the situation got worse and now I don't think that is an option anymore.

I can either go to Coastal Carolina University, study CS(ABET accredited) for one year then transfer to the school I want, or go to a community college and then transfer. 
I only need to pay $9,000 a year for tuition if I decided to go to Coastal Carolina, I think that is cheaper than going to community college.
*Well, here are the colleges now on my list are Virginia Tech, SUNY schools, Georgia Tech (probably not xd)

SUNYs and Virginia Tech will accept me for sure, bc they already accepted me once, the real question is, am I able to get a decent amount of scholarship from them if I choose the first option and do very well in school?(Coastal Carolina)

So frustrated Q__Q

129,Prismatic_Overture,1493834626,/r/college/comments/69218c/would_like_some_adviceinfo_about_high_school/,"I have/had severe OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) but have been getting better at managing it recently. I have also been recently diagnosed with ADD (and am finally getting treatment). I left the public school system in 8th grade and attended alternate/therapeutic schools. One was for truants and people struggling with addiction (not me) and one was for people with learning disabilities (also not exactly me). 

Recently (the last two school years) I have been getting one-on-one tutoring from a teacher from my districts public high school (where I would be attending) and in direct contact with one of the schools IEP (individual education plan) managers who handles my case. I'm technically enrolled and have been working hard to earn the credits I need to graduate now that I have a better handle on my disabilities. I am one year behind, my peers graduated last year and are now in college. If I work extremely hard it's possible I can graduate by the end of this year, which I hope to do so that I can enroll in college this fall rather than next fall, because then I would be spending an entire year doing nothing.

I have been looking at different colleges and how to get in, and one thing I noticed was certain class requirements, such as ""two years of a language"". I have literally never been attending high school normally, and honestly wasn't aware this type of thing was important (I was kind of a shitty student anyways. Maybe my attitude was caused by OCD and ADD or maybe I was just an irresponsible asshole, I don't know). I've been totally focused on the credits themselves that I need to graduate high school, and haven't payed attention to things like performance (I don't get graded. I have absolutely no clue if I even have a GPA.) and advance placement and language classes. 

**So my question is**: Am I totally screwed? What would a college think of something like my history? Do I need to take two years of language before being considered, are those kinds of things soft or hard limits? If I do need to take a language, can I get the language credits equivelant to two years or is it really two full years? If I have to take two more years to do those things will it look worse that I was three years behind in high school? I will have graduated high school, but am I still in trouble because of this? Should I not graduate and instead get those extra things before graduating? I'd like to finish my credits in the next month and a half but if I have to take another year of padding classes instead of graduating so I can get into college, I will. Do they make exceptions for disabilities? Do they make exceptions for anyone?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm on a new ADD med so I got a little more into this than I meant to. I really appreciate any help/advice you guys can offer me.

Side question: are there scholarship/grant options for people with disabilities? My family cannot help me with tuition so any kind of financial aid would really help me. 

Also I'm not sure how good I would be with a roommate. My OCD stuff can look strange to people and I wouldn't want to inconvenience anyone by asking them to uphold strange cleanliness requests or stuff like that.

130,blahhhhh90,1490074798,/r/college/comments/60lvn1/freaking_out_not_enough_time_to_study/,"Okay, so I'm a full time student. I take 6 full courses, all major required and intensive. (i'm a junior, 18 credits) and I work 3 part-time jobs. I can't quit the jobs because i need the money to pay for tuition and living expenses. I can't study part-time (too late, semester is already started anyways, but just mentioning it because it's not an option for the future) or take a semester off because i'm an international student (part-time isn't an option in my uni, and taking a semester off = losing my visa and to start again i would have to completely reapply to school all over again gotta love immigration policies) 

I have no social life like AT ALL, and the only thing that I spend time on for myself is working out in the morning or playing soccer with my uni's women's rec team 2x a week. these days only once a week because practice times interfere with my work schedule. 

I also have Lupus, which sometimes comes with it days at a time of pain and fatigue and brain fogginess that is unlike any other. Immense stress makes me really vulnerable to infections. While exercising is also stress on my body, since i started it's actually helped me so much. But making the time to exercise reduces not only my time available to sleep but also to study or even just sit and get my brain organized. 

I'm struggling with making the time to study, get adequate sleep, and take care of my health and eat and stuff too. I'm constantly walking into shit, forgetting and losing things, and forgetting what day it is or where i'm supposed to be. I'm usually a super clean and organized person too who's notorious for always having her shit together, so it's also stressful for me that i don't quite feel like myself.

I would quit soccer, but it's the only social interaction I get and the only thing that makes me happy and like...lets me get outdoors because every waking moment that I spend is in school, in the library, or at work. 

I've already barely passed 2 quizzes this semester, and that means that my chance at getting an A in those classes is already lost. I HAVE to get A's though...because I plan on going to grad school, and I need to raise my GPA to get a scholarship (scholarship = less necessity to work 3 part time jobs so....) 

so i'm writing here now because i'm desperate. I catch up on readings for classes when i'm standing in the sardine-packed subway going to and from work, and in between classes. I eat like once a day because i don't have time to cook anything decent or money to spare eating out. My weekends consist of me locked up in the library CATCHING UP on stuff i couldn't do during the week or the previous weekend...and i'm going insane trying to get back on track and be more adequately prepared for more surprise-quizzes. I already have 2 exam soon and i'm not even close to prepared nor do I know when i'll be able to spend time preparing without having to do it all at once last minute! 

[this is my timetable] (http://imgur.com/a/5r7qk)

it's spaced out in intervals of 15 minutes, and obviously doesn't include time spent eating, using the bathroom, having a conversation with someone that wasn't planned, running errands and cleaning and stuff that's not consistent. And the only reason I would choose to not go to the gym in the morning is because i need to sleep an extra hour longer. Otherwise, everything in there is fixed and I can't do much about it. When I get even 15 minutes off of my schedule i freak out because, like I said, my time is limited and precious. I can't even date anybody because i'm just too freaking busy to meet people. 

I care a lot about my grades, and I want to be perfect and be the best and smartest and create excellent opportunities for me to get into good grad schools...but I don't want to be tired and sore from sitting in a chair all day with poor posture and a weak body, or get fat and ugly from lack of exercise and self-care (which would also make dating in the future when i get more free time a hopeless endeavor) 

there MUST be a way, somehow, to balance this out without putting my health even more at risk or losing my mind. please help, I don't know what to do. I wish I could just win the lottery or get a big scholarship so I don't have to struggle like this. I can't even attend school colloquiums and special lectures because of work!

In terms of stateside schools, I've been looking into Georgetown for their School of Foreign Service, George Washington, Johns Hopkins, University of Virginia, School of International Relations at the University of Denver, etc.

However, I've also been recommended schools in the U.K. like St. Andrews University or London School of Economics and Political Science. These are clearly some of the best schools in the U.K., but I'm struggling to determine how they stack up against American universities such as Georgetown or Johns Hopkins.

I do have to note that normally, the U.K. schools are priced MUCH lower with a much more reasonable tuition (~60k for Georgetown, ~20k for LSE).

Assuming I get into all of these schools, and disregarding what I like or dislike personally about them, what would be my best option here - purely from a ""what school will look best on my job application"" standpoint? How is the academic reputation of LSE or St. Andrews' compared to Georgetown or George Washington?

I am a junior who recently transferred to major in this (https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/agriculture/majors/agricultural-education-and-communication.aspx#2) and I think I want to switch to this (https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/agriculture/majors/family-youth-and-community-sciences.aspx).

I chose my current major because agriculture is a way of life for me, I have been involved in it for most of my life and it is the field I want to work in after graduating, and my career aspirations are to work with a non-profit within agriculture doing some kind of communications or project work, it seemed like a fit. I came here wanting to learn how to communicate...i.e. writing, social media, graphic design, and how to apply that within my community. I want to stay in Florida after I'm done with school I think. Eventually (like 10-20 years down) I want to teach and maybe get a Master's degree.

I'm just not happy with the coursework or the people in my current major. I know leadership is important, but it's not everything, and they try to take us away from focusing on actually communicating about agriculture to ""interpersonal leadership"" and other assorted b.s. It's bad enough that they pull in faculty that have no experience in the field itself, only ""leadership,"" and don't understand when I have to be gone two weeks for an internship at the industry's largest convention [and how prestigious that is]. The more classes I attend and other departmental things I attend the more disgusted I get. I've talked with my ""adviser"" and all she says is just get over it, not everyone cares about agriculture...then why do you teach in a college for it??? I dread class...dipwad ""adviser"" also put me in 8 a.m. classes every day where up to 45 PERCENT of overall grade is based on attendance and somehow that's okay and because registration for all of them is ""departmentally controlled,"" meaning they can do this and I couldn't do anything about it. Needless to say I don't have much fun here at college..

I'm not at this school because it's ""UF"" like all the pre-meds that are everywhere that have 100s of schools to choose from, I'm here because I get my Bright Futures and instate tuition and it's the only school in the state with agriculture. Out-of-state sadly isn't an option...little too much financial burden and I would like to stay somewhat within agriculture and FYCS would help me do it. Thoughts?

134,Gawdtillajr,1473285011,/r/college/comments/51nsyh/delayed_graduation_due_to_one_course/,"Hi Reddit, 

This is my first post in this sub, but I have been lurking. Okay, I am in, what is supposed to be my last semester of college. I am going for my bachelor's in Interdisciplinary Studies. 

I was previously an Elementary Education major, but, due to Illinois strict reigns on their teachers (my mother is a principal-soon to be a superintendent), I do not think that is the right career for me. 


Now, with the new major, I have 21 credit hours left to graduate. There are two required courses for the major (6 credit hours), and the other courses just have to be upper level (15 credit hours). On the student portal, both required major courses have no pre-or concurrent requisites listed. 


After talking to the advisor, she claims that they cant be taken together and that one is a prereq. Both classes cover completely different topics, and without the second required course, my graduation will be delayed until May. My parents are only willing to let me live at home and help pay for schooling until December. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and had to take two years of off school. Next year, both of my younger siblings will be entering college and my parents cannot afford all three of us. They pay about a quarter of my tuition now, and are struggling to do that (but very willing and very supportive). 


Basically, the school wants me to wait an entire semester to take 1, 3 credit hour course in Sp2016. I think I can handle both courses at the same time, and it would be financially feasible to take all the courses now, while I have help. I believe that it is a waste of time, and my money, to pay tuition in order to take 1 course (it will be tuition plus the cost of 3 credit hours, about 4k that I know I wont have). Right now, my tuition can be covered by myself, my parents and FinAid. 


Do you think I have grounds for any argument here? I am meeting with the advisor again, tomorrow morning, and she says she can explain in detail, why they cannot be taken together, but I cant see myself waiting 6 months to take 1 course. I put all of my money into this semester already, and im not seeing the same course at any of the community colleges near me. 

ETA: 

Here's another problem, im not sure of what the actual problem is because it's not making sense to me. I took Child Development at Ohio State. Now, at OSU, child development is NOT considered an upper division course because they feel that the content is not hard enough. 
Here at my new school, Child Development IS an upper division course. I looked at the curriculum and it pretty much matches up. Theyre saying they cant count it as an upper division course because at OSU its not an upper division course. That doesnt make sense to me. The work is the same, the course is the same, but they wont give me upper division credit. I got the okay to take both classes but i cant go over 21 credit hours. I assumed they would count the Child Development course.

Hey guys! I've compiled this handy little list for you and weighed out their pros and cons. Some of these websites have overlap with the sidebar links, so check those out too!

**1. [The Common App](http://www.commonapp.org/):** Obviously. But what isn't so obvious is this site's helpfulness beyond the ""Apply Now"" button. The site is *jam-packed* with videos answering tons of questions that have crossed every applicant's mind. If you don't find content that answers your questions - you can tweet to their highly responsive [virtual counselor](http://www.commonapp.org/virtual-counselor). Clicking literally anywhere else besides the ""Apply Now"" button can actually be extremely helpful - and it's something most applicants miss. 

**2. [The College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/):** Now look, I know the site may not be the prettiest on the *outside*, but I beg of you to give it a shot, and you will definitely change your mind. This site is absolutely golden if you're struggling to find universities which suit you. It has an easily accessible [database of statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/SurveyGroups.asp?group=2) to help guide you through the first stage of applying: choosing your university. And let me tell you, it really isn't always Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, or MIT - even though they may come to mind at first.

**3. [IvyApps](http://www.ivyapps.org):** Alright, alright. Let's say you're a big shot and want to apply to one of these top universities. One of the most helpful resources I found during the application process was a database of full applications and essays that were accepted from previous years. IvyApps has a database of over 20 full applications and over 60 essays accepted to top schools. [Here](http://ivyapps.org/essay-got-into-5-ivy-leagues/) is one of their essays which was accepted to **FIVE** Ivy League Universities. Reading essays isn’t for everyone, and if you think it isn’t for you, I still recommend you take 5 minutes out of your schedule to give it a shot! 
*Payment Warning*: Their other content does cost money to access ($14). 

**4.  [Federal Student Aid](https://fafsa.ed.gov/):** So as most Redditors know, US university is expensive. Like, [REALLY](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years) expensive. And since not all of us are heirs to cottages in Martha's Vineyard, we all have to find a way to save money. FAFSA is a really good website which can tell you what scholarships and aid you are eligible for. The first thing you should do, before you even put pen to paper and draft your essay, is sit down with your parents and have a talk about money. After the talk is over and they develop ulcers over tuition prices, show them FAFSA, and be their financial hero of the day. You may be surprised at how much financial aid you are eligible for.

**5. [Good 'Ol Sal Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat):** By now, everyone should recognize the soothing and supple voice of the one and only Sal Khan. I mean, he's probably the only reason why any of us got grades good enough to even be *eligible* for college. But it turns out Mr. Khan now teaches just a little more than algebra and economics; he's teamed up with the College Board to produce lessons specifically designed for the SAT. So sit back, relax, and press play as you learn how to ace the SAT. I highly recommend Khan Academy, and as I like to say: a video a day keeps the anxiety away!

**6. [CollegeExpress](http://www.collegexpress.com/):** It's all about the money. And beyond financial aid, it turns out you can save even more money - yeah you heard me - MORE. Just by having hobbies and being good at school. CollegeExpress has been the best search engine for scholarships in the USA that I have found so far. A little clacking of the keyboard and *voila!* Thousands of dollars at your fingertips. I really do recommend you check this out, because way too few people actually make use of the free money, all because they were too lazy to write a few hundred words. I can assure you that if you've survived high school you sure as hell can survive a few extra hours on the computer.

**7. [yconic.](https://yconic.com/):** Simply put - this is the Canadian version of CollegeExpress, but in my view, it is much more easy to navigate and use. The landing page says it all - over a hundred million dollars are available to you if you spend a few minutes on the site. Few minutes on site --&gt; few thousand in savings, now that is some return on investment a hedge fund manager would beg for.
*Side Note*: I'm literally not exaggerating when I say you only need to spend a few minuted on the computer - some of these scholarships only require you to put in your name and email. Now that's cool!

**8. [The College Board](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat?navId=gh-sat):** If you’ve made it all the way down my post - congratulations, you’ve earned the reward of the most stressful yet helpful website on the list. The College Board is the hub of *ALL* relevant standardized tests: from APs to SATs to SAT IIs (yes those exist). What I recommend you do on this website is the following: make a checklist for yourself. Research all the standardized tests they offer and make a list of all the ones you need. Add registration dates to your calendar, and if you haven’t done so already, **MAKE A CALENDAR**. You don’t know how many kids wait until the last minute to study or register - make this your first move in setting yourself apart.

136,oceanblue143,1462745843,/r/college/comments/4ignd8/im_struggling_in_my_sciences_courses_what_should/," I am currently a freshman, pre-dental on a behavioral neuroscience track with a minor in studio art at a decently competitive school. My issue is that in my general biology and general chemistry courses I understand the material but do absolutely terribly on the tests even though they give partial credit. Last semester I believe I ended with a 2.5 and 2.25 in chem and bio, but 3.5s in my art and writing courses. In a week I will likely see the same results from this semester, if not 2.0s for the science classes.



 I know I perform very well in art, public speaking, writing classes and the sort, but still love to learn how the world works and almost see the classes I'm good at as not as valuable/worth the tuition. But my GPA is doing terribly because of my performance on the tests/quizzes, and they are unacceptable grades for getting into dental school even though I've done many dental programs and shadowed over 50 hours already. I chose behavioral neuro because I love and am great at psychology and learning about neuron-type things. 



The only other career that I am really interested in is medical illustration which is also very competitive. I've somewhat had an epiphany recently that I could be happy simply being a mom or a school teacher and study simply what I enjoy in college, but for some reason I can't fully accept this in terms of fully giving up on the pre-dental track. With the major and medical illustration I would be taking pretty much the same courses, anyway. I think it is organic chemistry next year that is freaking me out the most. 


This year I have also struggled with severe anxiety, OCD and depression and had to go on medical leave for a week this semester. The stress I can't help but put on myself about my science classes are the main reason this year has been so hard on me. I've been with tutors, academic advisors, therapists, psychiatrists, the works as well as having a therapy dog on campus to help me through this year. 


I'm looking for advice- if I improve my grades somehow for the next three years, do I have a chance at dental school if I mention about how my freshman year was not a good reflection on my general performance because of the mental health and other struggles I faced? How much would dental research help along with a ton of additional shadowing hours? Should I repeat general biology or chemistry? Should I wait and see how well I do in other pre-requisites such as physics and calc?

tldr; struggling with my freshman science courses, still a shot at dental school or should I just explore and give up on the track?

I'm in an amazing school for a BA in Game Art.  I transferred in a year and a half ago so I didn't get to experience all of college here.  I'm proud to say I have an awesome background with different art classes at my other colleges that got me to where I am, but I still feel behind.

I only just learned how to model in 3D one year ago and since then I've been bombareded with awesome tools that I now know how to use.  Back when I wanted to be a graphic designer I had a lot of design/art/software already in my skillset, but now I've only had a year to learn literally the entire industry.  During this time I didn't even get to do all the fun things at my college, events, networking events, make friends.  I've been too busy learning.

Now that I'm finally settled into the school and mindset of being a game artists, I'm upset that I have to think about graduating already...  I JUST got here it seems.  My portfolio is lacking because I only have beginner things.  I'm STILL learning the basics.  I still haven't networked enough.  I just don't feel ready to be a part of the world.

I'm not worried too much about the set back because there seems to be a lot in my favor:

- I have time (spring and summer) to actually use the skills I learned from homework assignments
- I can build my portfolio, one that really represents me
- I can look for work in the Winter after I graduate (more opportunities than summer?)
- I have one more chance at a summer internship
- I can quit this shitty part time job and finally work full time in spring/summer so I can FINALLY be out of SOME debt (I'm struggling)


Questions:

- Are there any benefits to graduating in Fall?
- Does it cost more per semester if I go for for Fall only as opposed to the whole year combined?
- Am I ineligible for internships for summer if I'm not ""currently enrolled"" aka for Spring semester?  Or can I be enrolled for Fall 2016 and be eligible for some internships.  I dont want to be considered some random, I still want to be seen as a student at my college in my off semester.
- Any tips/advice/stories?

Nobody told me about the option of Medical Withdrawl from classes, so every semester I'd end up failing and registering again the next for the same ones. My doctors always said ""there shouldn't be another stone"" so I always had hopes to keep going to classes. Well after three semesters of that I was dismissed from the university for a poor GPA and I am currently at a community college, which left me with another year of stones, and I'm looking at third enrollment for these classes I've been trying to take for three years.

The problem now is my financial situation. A good chunk of my hospital bills were stayed by my savings which no longer exists. Some were taken care of through hospital assistance, but the rest are in collections. Now as far as I've been told, until those are out of collections (paid, not being paid), nobody will loan me money privately to go to school, even with cosigners. My poor GPA lost me all grant money, and I only get about 2000 dollars in subsidized loans which pays for less than one semester of tuition. 

I have about 15k in debt from multiple outpatient treatments, as well as an outstanding bill from university before I can go back. Do I have any other options besides quitting to work? I've been working to pay for tuition, but I cant afford tuition at a real university once I repair my GPA as I'm already struggling pretty hard to meet the payment plan as it is.

Does this even belong here? Maybe /r/finance? I'm so lost and I feel like I'm drowning while the school does things like drop me from my classes after I pay, I don't feel welcome. I don't have anyone to turn to for advice out here, so I turn to the internet.",college,Do I have any other financial options?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3e9a7f/do_i_have_any_other_financial_options/,1437624543.0
139,[deleted],1425401804,/r/college/comments/2xsw7n/starting_over/,"I am currently a junior at a four-year university. I was a good high school student and managed to secure a full scholarship to my local uni but due to health issues of both the mental and physical kind, I have been unable to perform effectively in college and will likely lose my academic and housing scholarships this semester.

I started as a computer science major and in my zeal to learn more about computing, I completely disregarded my basic sciences freshman year. In the middle of my sophomore year, I realized that I was more interested in medical research than software engineering (which is what my school's CS program essentially amounts to). I am now struggling in intro-level sciences because the last time I took basic sciences was in high school and I never developed the study habits for learning material that disinterested or did not come easily to me. Due to my awkward course completion and late change of heart, my graduation date is delayed until Spring 2017 at the earliest.  

Ideally, I would like to start over. The tuition for my university is too high without a scholarship so I'm thinking of transferring to a two-year, redoing calculus, taking my biological science pre-reqs, and then attempting to secure a transfer to a cheaper four year if scholarships are inaccessible. 

I am hoping that a community college environment will allow me a little more breathing room and support so that I can learn some effective life and study skills while also allowing me time to get a better handle on my health. Also, when I do begin the four year search again, I will know what to look in a university that I was ignorant of the first time around. 

I'm planning to bring this up with my counselor but I'd like some uninvolved opinions as well. ",college,"""Starting over""",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2xsw7n/starting_over/,1425419804.0
140,SuliAwesome,1408994434,/r/college/comments/2ek19m/which_american_uni_would_be_my_best_bet_at/,"This is my first post, so if I did something wrong, that's why.

I'm an international student from the Middle East. I've been attending private American schools since preschool up until graduating from high school a few months ago. Anyway, for the past few years my goal was to attend college in the states, but my parents flat-out said that they won't be supporting me in any way as they are already struggling financially. This is due to them being irresponsible with their savings, my older brother being autistic and my younger brother having $132,600 worth of debt because he got his pilot license from the Oxford Aviation Academy.

My grades are pretty good; a straight 3.9 accumulated GPA on my high school transcript (I'm a hard worker, didn't fool around in school, though now I find myself wishing I did). I got accepted at the University of South Florida, but all the aid I received was like $320 (I'm guessing this was because I didn't apply for financial aid). I did compete in my country's scholarship program (which gives you the opportunity to study literally anywhere you want), made it from the couple of hundreds to the top sixty candidates, but failed to make it to the ten winners.

Now I've registered with the local university (Uni of Bahrain) for a computer science major with the hopes of transferring next year should I get a merit scholarship from any uni in the states. My classes for this term are Calculus I, General Physics I, Computer Programming I, and ENG Language Development (an English class designed for public school students with literally zero knowledge in English, I'm being forced to take it). It's a poor university, with conservative beliefs (I don't consider myself religious), and a stupid standard of education. I could literally get expelled if I was seen shaking hands with a girl. Not to mention that I have to deal with my religious family; my dad wakes me up every day at 4AM so I could just walk two streets to the **** mosque. Every. Day. No kidding. For the past eight years. Then there's the four other prayers and the constant nagging. I respect him so I do as he says (though he's driven me to depression more than once), but college was supposed to be my getaway. 

Anyways, I need advice. What universities do you know (doesn't matter if they're 500th ranked state schools or private ones, the more suggestions, the better) that would likely give a full or half tuition merit scholarship to an international transfer student (next spring or fall term)? I wouldn't mind applying as an undergraduate student freshman for this spring or next fall term since I'm aware that most universities offer these big merit scholarship packages to freshmen, not transfer students.  Please don't suggest need-blind universities like Amherst or Dartmouth (I don't think I could get in anyway), I want to know my safest bet. Advice, suggestions, anything is welcome (I'm kinda desperate here).

Don't know what the TL;DR is... sorry.",college,Which American uni would be my best bet at getting a merit scholarship?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2ek19m/which_american_uni_would_be_my_best_bet_at/,1409012434.0
141,iswearimachef,1408083277,/r/college/comments/2dm3cy/am_i_crazy_or_is_something_weird_going_on_with_my/,"I'm a junior who was supposed to start nursing school next week. Except I'm not. My department is screwing me over. The problems started in the fall. I had taken all of my prerequisite classes but two, and you needed permission numbers to get in to the classes. I did everything I was supposed to do, and my advisor said ""oh, we'll send you the numbers next week."" But she didn't. Then, the next week, I emailed and she told me I would have to wait for grades to post, and the next week she told me to wait for some processing. Then the school closed for Christmas. When it opened back up, I emailed and emailed and emailed, and then the classes were all full. So I had to spend my time and money taking a chemistry class instead of what I was supposed to be taking. Well, I called to complain, and the advisor had left a few days before. I had no advisor for 2 months. Well, it was all okay, because I could just take the classes that summer. The next problem happened when I was supposed to get my acceptance to nursing school. My school has a policy that qualified students who started out as a freshman have automatic acceptance. I qualified and was guaranteed by my old advisor that I would get in. Then, come April, I didn't. I called my advisor, and she didn't answer. I tried to make an appointment, but she was booked up. I even called the dean of the department, who sent me straight back to my advisor. Finally, I got an email saying that she had a cancellation and she'd meet with me. I actually got my parents to go with me, because they obviously don't listen to me, so I thought they'd listen to someone who paid the tuition. Well, we finally got her to look at it, and surprise! There had been a clerical error and I was supposed to be admitted. Well, I got admitted two days later. Now I had to get the permission numbers for summer. I had to email almost every day for two weeks before she finally let me have them, the day before class starts. Well, my classes started for the summer, and I started struggling with one of them. Now, I'll just say that my grades have never been perfect, but if I'm not doing well, I won't go down without a fight. So I went to her office every week asking for tips, studied for 2 hours every day, went to every class. Then my homeworks and quizzes started disappearing off of Blackboard. Like it never happened. I'd taken them and made good grades, but they were not even showing up. It was ridiculous. I asked her for study tips all the time, talked to my (different) advisor several times, worked really really hard. But I only made it out with a 72. (Nursing classes consider a 74 or lower failing.) Now I'm a semester behind. So I called my advisor, who sent me to my old pre-nursing advisor to get the permission numbers ONCE AGAIN. It's been a week, and I still haven't heard back. 

I know that I'll sound crazy for this, but I think they're trying to get me to drop out. Withholding permission numbers, rejecting me from the school? I think they're trying to weed me out because I only have a 3.0 GPA when most of the other kids have a 4.0. We have one of the highest employment rates (97% of graduates have job offers before they even graduate) in the state. It's like they take the kids who are most likely to fail, and make them fail before they can mess up our statistics. I know that failing the class was on me, but everything else feels so out of my control. I feel like they're just playing me like a marionette! Am I crazy?

TL;DR: Feel like department is trying to weed me out through immoral means before I start the program. Also might be paranoid.",college,"Am I crazy, or is something weird going on with my department?

142,TornadoOfShelter,1393191678,/r/college/comments/1yqhbb/seriously_considering_transferring_but_not_sure/,"So I'm currently an out-of-state sophomore undergrad engineering major at the University of Michigan. I did great my freshman year and came out with a 3.6 GPA. I was piling on debt, but I didn't really care that much because I just assumed I could get a job after college and pay it all off in no time.

Now that I'm nearing the end of my fourth semester, I'm kind of struggling with classes. I'm passing them, but some of them just barely. Due to this, the pressure of the debt is starting to catch up to me.

I've been looking into options a bit, and a transfer to Penn State seems like it could be good. The tuition is about half what I'm paying now (I'm from PA), and while it's no Michigan, it's still a good school. It's also about an hour and a half from my home, so that's nice.

The only things really holding me back are the amazing friends who I have here, the fact that I would be going to an (somewhat) inferior school, and just general sense that I shouldn't change schools just because.

143,[deleted],1353624609,/r/college/comments/13n2e1/the_college_bubble_the_combination_of_economic/,"Since we were young, we've been told that with hard work and determination in high school we would one day make it to college. Once there, if we succeeded with graduating, we'd get a degree which would lead to a well-paying career that would allow us to invest in our future.  With college tuition now leading in the nation's debt with the growing amount of 830 million dollars, we are stuck asking: Why is the college-loan system failing? The College Bubble was a term used to explain the effect of the nation's current financial crisis and college tuition constantly on the rise. That is creating the bubble of debt that will eventually burst. College tuition rates have skyrocketed up 29% in the last five years. The average school year for a standard four year, for-profit college now costs $27,293 and on average only two out of three students are graduating due to not being able to afford their college education. With the economy in a recession and losing over 8 million jobs between the years of 07-09, graduates are struggling in the job market, as well as paying off their student loans (Parker). During the beginning of the recession, many industries felt the collapsing of the economy, industries like that of the stock market, real estate and even oil! All industries but two: healthcare and colleges. During this difficult time, colleges are prospering at student's expense and graduates are not seeing the benefit. This makes the expenditure of college and the hard work of graduates, a poor investment. The government has tried to help students with government aid and programs for low-income graduates, but has failed to fix the problem. Colleges are charging too much for an education that even with government aid and loans cannot be affordable or paid off by a graduate in this struggling economy. The college loan system is failing students due to an endeavoring economy, over college spending causing higher tuition rates, depleting wages and declining job market. College tuition and the loan system that is in place to fund it must be modified to compensate in order to lower student debt. 
	College tuition has obviously risen to unmanageable amounts for college students, but why? It is due to the college arms race. Colleges are currently spending huge amounts of money on their campuses and recreational activities in order to encourage more students, which also means more money. Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder was quoted saying, ""Every campus has [to have] it’s climbing wall, you cannot have a campus without a climbing wall""(McArdle). In 2009 alone, colleges spent a total of 10.7 billion dollars on construction of new facilities like gyms and nicer dorms in an afford to recruit more students. (Parker). Students will pay more money to attend a college that has a favorite college sports teams. When it comes to NCAA coaches, Brady states statistically that the average salary for a NCAA football coach was is $1.47 million in 2011, which in the last six seasons has climbed up nearly 55% (Brady). If teams meet performance goals, coaches will, in addition, receive bonuses. Such expenses made by colleges for sport teams, may be leisure for a student but how does this help them with a better quality education or with their crippling debt? Students are paying for something that in no way betters their education, just the notoriety of the college. Colleges have found many ways to capitalize off of their students in order to afford such expenditures. Some 4 year colleges require that you must be on campus for your first two years of attending with them. Room and board cost an average of $8,887 in the school year of 2011-12, that is up 4% since last year (College Board). It would make sense why they would require that you stay on campus, if it only put more money into their pockets. College books are another expense of students which colleges are benefitting from. Books are also required by colleges in order to attend classes and are not included in tuition. The cost of college books has tripled in the last 10 years, costing an average of $200 dollars (Parker). Colleges will publish their own books, require students to buy them, then update or revise them every year to make the book obsolete causing students to have to by new ones every year and making the resale of them, nonexistent! Colleges will work with publishers and receive kickbacks for using books they publish. Administration for college also feels the advantage of higher tuition rates. The president of Yale receives salary that has tripled from $591,709 in 2000, to $1.63 million in 2009 (McArdle). 
	Some experts argue that the rising cost of college tuition is due to federal aid programs. David Schnittger, aide to Education and Workforce Committee, argues that, ""The federal government should not have to automatically subsidize hyperinflation,” that ""there is no pressure on [colleges] to keep their rates down [due to government student tuition assistance programs]"" (Colin). What they don't take into consideration is that government aid is normally only given to low-income students. Middle and upper class students don't receive such aid. So how is it that government funded aid programs are to blame for the rising tuition costs? Now with the average cost of graduating at a 4 year college at $27,293 a year (Parker), it is easy to see who is truly profiting from an attending and/or graduated student. Colleges are capitalizing off students in a poor economy, and once out of college there is no guarantee employment will be waiting. 
	In 2008, Americans lost over 10.4 trillion dollars in the financial crisis. Between 2008-2010 over 8.3 millions of jobs were lost. The government tried bailing out the country with  4.6 trillion dollars and was only able to recover 1.1 million jobs, .9% percent of jobs. That is 4 million dollars in cost for each job recovered (Parker). Boyce Watkins, a finance professor at Syracuse University is quoted saying, ""[College] is certainly an investment. The question is whether or not you get your return on that investment in actual financial capital... [and] this blanket notion that going to college will guarantee you a better economic future is not always true""(Billitteri). In 2009, the numbers were at 12.5 million unemployed, which is 8.1 percent of the American population. The numbers have continuing to rise leaving the total count of unemployed at 17.5 million. With unemployment at the highest it’s ever been in the last 25 years (Katel), it's easy to see that even with the investment of college education, the job market is not in a state of stability leaving the college graduate to take minimal paying jobs, move trades, or move altogether to an area which is hiring. All of which is at a cost to them. 
Many people can't afford to move, so they need jobs to come to them. This is one of the least discussed, most challenging problems in the labor market right now...This is the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began tabulating this data just after World War II. Most of the unemployed—62.3 percent—are out of work because they lost their job, higher than any point since 1982. (Boushey)
Some argue that college degrees do increase the likelihood of getting employment. The fields of healthcare, engineering and computer science have seen a sharp increase of employment within the last five years (Billitteri). However, are all students obligated to study in fields that are hiring so that they may make a high enough income to pay back student loans? If so, where will our educational teachers, earth science specialists and art specialists come from? Chances are these programs will lose funding. All these degree areas are feeling the economic downturn, does that mean that all students should have to pursue a degree that they don't wish to pursue, in order to guarantee enough income to pay back their student loans? Part of the American dream is to pursue what your passionate about, not to conform to the demands of society. Though some argue it is because of the student's degree choice, if all students were to graduate in a degree that was hiring, wouldn't that cause an abundancy of applicants? Making the job market for those jobs hiring like the rest, not hiring? College graduates not only face the outrageous cost of tuition but once finishing their degree they are stuck in a dead end job market which they cannot avoid. 
	With both college tuition and unemployment at record highs, it is not hard to see why the college loan system is failing. What once was the American dream has now turned into the national debt. With colleges spending too much on non-educational expenses and leaving their students to flip the bill in this economic downfall, it’s no wonder the college loan system is not helping the college graduate. The college loan system has to not only take into consideration the economy's state but the college's spending. While the nation is trying to recover and grow from the current recession it is important to recognize that student borrowing is working against our economic interests and the source of why that is happening. In order for the college graduate to pay off their debt, there must be employment after college and if that is not a guarantee, colleges must reevaluate their expenditures. Until the economy recovers from its current crisis, student debt will only worsen and end up not only costing the American graduate, but the nation as a whole.
