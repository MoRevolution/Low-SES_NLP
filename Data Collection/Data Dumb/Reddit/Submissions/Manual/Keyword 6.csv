For personal reference, I spend around 200 dollars a month on food, 375 on rent, 60 on gas, 150 on utilities, and 100 on miscellaneous stuff. I make around 900 at my job, and an addition 100-200 through doordash/instacart. I live in an apartment off campus, have a 500 dollars a semester meal plan which covers some lunches for long days on campus

*Coupon, Clearance, and More*

I hate this tip because it makes me look insane to my friends but I save money so I don't care. Walmart is the exception but most grocery stores have an app or printout with coupons and sales. Study and clip the ones you buy for yourself. Don't buy something because it has a coupon, only clip ones for stuff you already buy. Most stores have a clearance section, try to find the meat section and buy and freeze that meat, meat is the biggest expense I have on groceries so finding this out saves me 20-30 bucks on meat alone. Without coupons, clearance, and all that, my grocery bill would probably be almost double than it currently is.

*Plan your Spending*

I never raw dog my spending, I always have it planned out. For me I have in my calendar app my errands and how much I need to spend. For example, I go grocery shopping for 20 days out so on October 20th, I can spend 110 on groceries. I also plan some fun things like maybe 20 dollars for bath things, or 10 dollars at a fast food place. This just makes it a lot easier to budget and you get better as you learn your habits and needs. I don't put my entire budget on it because I like their to be some wiggle room to go on a spontaneous cookout run or something and you never know what's going to happen.

*Check your accounts everyday*

This won't save you any money but it does allow you to pace yourself and your spending. When I wake up, I make sure to check my bank account, credit cards, and Venmo (and school grades but that's not financial, just a good habit.). This just shows me how much I have, how much I am spending, and how much I can continue to spend. It also just makes sure there's no fraud, surprise purchases, or subscriptions. I also had financial anxiety my first couple semesters where I would be too scared to check balances and therefore would spend terribly. So getting in the habit and getting comfortable with viewing your balances is key to having everything in order. 

*Please don't get into addictive habits*

This is a more honest mistake I made, I got into vaping my senior year of high school in the pandemic and still struggle with it, honestly I don't do it often, just in the morning and at night but it still takes around 50 dollars a month from me that I could use on better things. If you are on the fence about these things, just stay away and use that money on things that will bring you honest joy. My friend quit and she's spends the money she would on vaping on bath and skin care and stuff like that.

*Store Brand is going to be your new best friend*

There are of course, store brand things that just don't cut it, but try to make some substitutions and see that grocery budget go down a lot. For example when I go grocery shopping, I will get store brand pizza rolls (they are 10x better than totinos), cereal, chips, and fruit snacks, pasta, sauces, cleaning wipes, paper towels, etc. most of them are the same and made in the same factory, you'll live. Sodas, hair products, etc I get name brand because those are just my afforded luxuries. 

*Plan those luxuries*

You can budget all you want for necessities but 99% of the time, you will slip up and that okay, we all do it. I decreased this in myself by putting on my calendar budget, 20 dollars on a date night with my boyfriend, or 50 dollars on an Amazon haul on apartment stuff. This just allows me to just be able to have a bit of fun while staying on a budget

*Go off campus as soon as you can*

On-Campus living is very expensive and while you are not paying for it now, you will soon. Most campuses have a 1 or 2 year mandatory dorm living experience but see about getting an exemption or something to get off campus asap. When finding an apartment, skip on the big corporate housing like those 20 building apartment complexes, and find a local, realtor. Ours just owns like 5 2 or 3-unit houses around town and personally takes care of them all. The rent is amazingly cheap, and I live close to campus in an actual house instead of student apartments which tend to be shit often.

*Cut down on Services and Subscriptions*

If you are in college, I know its tempting to get doordash or ubereats but I promise you its not worth it. Go pick up the food if you really wanted to get takeout food. With subscriptions, always look up student discounts. For things like Hulu or HBO, try to set something up with your friends to split the bill, most allow 2-3 people on at the same time so see about spllitng up that 12 dollar Hulu account.

*Be Smart with Drinks*

This is just an nsfw tip but very useful and a little shady. Be safe but try to just get alcohol handed to you. Typically friends will be open to share and just drink what they have or what's handed to you by trusted people, its expensive, I did not pay for alcohol for the first 2 years of college from this.

1,Overhuill,1665966932,/r/college/comments/y5wo1x/my_roomate_has_been_acting_very_alarming/,"A few months ago I (19M) had moved into an apartment just off campus. To help pay for the apartment I posted about it on our schools app (We basically have a social media app for our school). Soon enough some guy contacted me and we quickly arranged to copay for the apartment

The first few months were completely fine- he is rather more outgoing than me and was out very often throughout the day. We vibed well enough together- not enough that I’d consider us friends, but definitely enough to where we are “good” acquaintances. But he was a very chill and laid back guy

But starting a few weeks ago I noticed a significant shift in his demeanor- he became much more quiet and reserved. He started giving off a rather ominous vibe and didn’t go out as much as he used to

Then came the first several big red flags- he started closing the curtains during the day (Normally I’d do that and he’d immedietly open them back up), but more importantly, he was evidently more irritable and would be rather passive aggressive now when I talked to him

I was going around my room earlier today when I heard a weird click. Normally I would brush it off but for some reason I decided to look around my room… and found a camera. The camera was positioned in a way where I couldn’t see it normally- and it was pointed directly at my bed- in MY room. I have no idea how legal this is since technically it is his apartment. I would normally start looking for other places at this point but the apartments around here are very expensive compared to the one we are in.

Now what drove me to post this was what happened an hour ago. We were both in the house before I left to head towards the dining center (maybe a 15 minute walk). Now it was already dark- at night I always make sure to be paranoid while walking alone since we are in the middle of the city. So one fun times I had casually glanced behind me I saw my roomate maybe 30 feet behind me walking too. He had the exact same hoodie on as he did before but now his hoodie was up even though it wasn’t raining. Normally I wouldn’t think twice about this- but due to his recent behavior I immedietly was put on edge and decided to test him. When I reached and enter section I took a very sharp left and started walking away from the dining center. I glance and sure enough he followed. I decided to do it one more time and took another left at the first oppertunity (Which means we are now walking backwards). When I saw he did the exact same I banked into the first open building I could find and stayed there. He never came inside

I’m at a friends house for the night and I just want to ask… am I overreacting? I don’t know it could very well just be stress from school but honestly I haven’t been too stressed out. Is there literally anything I can do or could I really just be freaking out over nothing?",college,My roomate has been acting very alarming,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y5wo1x/my_roomate_has_been_acting_very_alarming/,1665984932.0

I’m on my fifth year over here because I took a gap semester during Covid. I’m from the west coast and I am really starting to despise each day that I am here. I have really bad anxiety, and depression, and I am really wishing that I went to a school on the other coast. Things haven’t been easy at home with my family, but I really miss them and feel like they’re the only ones who could make me feel better. Maybe I’m just acting like a child and need to grow up and deal with it. but everyday I seriously question my life and my interactions with people because I don’t feel like I’m living my truth. I don’t know why I though it’d be good for me to go to school over here since I’m such a homebody. I don’t have motivation to go to clubs or meet people. I’m going to an expensive university and if I withdrawal from here now, I won’t get any tuition refunded. I just don’t know if I can last here another semester too.

I go to a land grant university, and like most land grants, it's in a small city. I have a great advisor here in my program, I enjoy my classes enough, I know a couple people who go here, and in general I don't mind going to this school that much. It's not perfect, but nothing is yknow? I just hate living in the town so much.

My biggest problem is transit. I don't own a car because it's too expensive and I don't have (and probably couldn't get) a driver's license. This was never such a big issue until the city discontinued bus service on weekends and limited it during the week as well, now taking transit is just a bad experience and I'm more or less stranded in my apartment unless my parents can come here or I'm on campus during the week. I can walk to campus, it's only about 2 miles away, but any commercial business is much farther away than that. 

I also just don't like living here. I prefer big cities, and a lot of people say they prefer small towns because there's less crime, but here I've experienced more things like random people yelling at me, harassment, getting followed and even chased more than I ever have been living anywhere else. It's also well known how much theft occurs on and around the campus (particularly for bikes, but it extends to other things as well). 

I don't want to sound like I'm whining or anything, but it just kind of grates on me living in a place I dislike and having to do so for another 2 years to finish my degree. I've already transferred before so I don't think it would be smart to do so, and I kind of just have to deal with it more or less. My experience at every university/college I've studied at or visited or anything is that unless you're at a very integrated urban university, the campus always feels separated from the city or town around it, and I definitely feel like that's true here as well. Like I said, I don't mind the campus and university, but once I step off campus I just dislike being here.

I'm curious to know how others feel about this. I know a lot of people move to my university from all over the country and the world, and once you've made a big decision like that, it's pretty difficult to justify leaving, and that's kind of the situation I'm in as well except I'm in state so I'm not that far from my hometown and everything like that. Do a lot of other people feel like they kind of just have to accept living in a place they don't really care for in order to complete their education?",college,Hating the town my college is in,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y4zm66/hating_the_town_my_college_is_in/,1665888526.0

LSU Pros: my gf is going there, Its close to home(I’m from br), majority of my friends will be going there, parents want me to go there. 
LSU Cons: expensive, i would have to live at home bc dorms cost too much

ULL Pros: my cousin goes there and he wants me to come live with him, i think it will be fun if i wanted to branch out more, it isn’t as expensive as LSU 

ULL Cons: far from home, farish from my gf and friends, idk anyone going there

SELU Pros: Dorms are really nice, the least expensive of the three(I pretty much get to go for free), Ik a couple people going here, it isn’t too far from home 

SELU Cons: my gf isn’t going there, None of my main friends are going here, Idk who I will hang out with and a lot of people I don’t like are already at this school.

so i'm currently in my first semester at community college for a criminal justice degree, the hope is to eventually be a lawyer, but that's a solid 7 years away. before starting this, i went to cosmetology school for a year and i absolutely LOVED it. it was my dream and it was what i had always wanted to do in the first place. unfortunately i developed allergies to hair product and color from over exposure, and had to drop out with only 1/4 of my program left.

took me a while to get myself back on my feet and put back together, but in the end i decided to pursue law. i've always been interested in it &amp; did mock trial in high school. so far i love my courses that are major specific! 

but i am a little concerned about realistically how long 7 years is, and how my degree might not be too useful if i don't end up going to law school at the end of those 7 years. i guess i'm kind of looking for a fall back plan, and something a little higher paying while i work through college?

so i had the idea to look into nail tech school. it's a 300 hour program (12 hours a week for 6.5 months) and it would go perfectly into my schedule with the classes ive already enrolled in. the cost isn't crazy expensive (about the same for a semester at my community college) and it's offered by the cos school i went to already. they might even accept some of my prior hours towards this program.

so my question is: how realistic would it be to do this nail program for 6 months while in community college, so that for the next 6.5 years, i'm making around $19/hr and have a fall back plan? it's 4 hours a night for 3 nights a week, and i already have connections in that field for after i get licensed. how would this affect my college education? anyone else who did trade school and college and made it work?

It’s so fucking cliquey and I’ve never fit in here, not once. People join their activities and form their circles and don’t even want to talk to people outside of them. I’ve tried joining clubs, talking to people in class, etc. Everyone just looks at me like I have three heads so I just move on. I keep my head down when I’m walking around because I don’t even want to make eye contact anymore.

I have a small group of about six people that I’m really close with and I recognize this is more than a lot of people have, so I don’t mean to sound ungrateful. It’s just so lonely here because I have no connections outside of that small group, so my day to day life is spent almost completely alone. I can’t remember the last time I ate a meal in the dining hall or with someone else. The one time I did get into a relationship, he abused and stalked me so I gave all that up too. 

There are no fraternities or house parties here so I started going to bars, but I didn’t have any friends to go with me, so I stopped.

I went to the Fashion Institute of Technology in NY and am 50/50 on my experience. It was a great school to learn about the industry, but expensive for the education (depending on what you study). I studied fashion business and remember one of my finals was on the color wheel. lol. Not to mention most of my finals were open book / we received a work sheet prior with almost all the questions that would be on the test. 

I ended up dropping out because I got a job in the industry, so my experience is rather limited. However, had I had the money to go to school without any burden, I probably would have finished my degree. 

Another note, I remember a majority of the teachers telling me that a degree is not an important factor in getting a job in the industry- which they were 100% correct.

In the end, I was stuck with 30K+ in student loan debt for 1 year of schooling. Not *too* bad, but my biggest complaint was the school would throw random events throughout the year. One of them was literally a huge carnival event in front of the campus. That was something that defiantly rubbed me the wrong way. I remember thinking, this is what my tuition is paying for ???! lol

It has drastically gotten worse over the summer after I came back from college when I started traveling for the first time. I realized once I got home how much better somewhere else might be with my fiancé. 

My brother resents my mother. We have a pretty close relationship. Every week or other week there is a huge blowup with the two of them, which causes me a lot of stress, anxiety, and depression. My mother also dumps her emotions onto me, and I can't take it much longer. I turned into the parent instead of someone she can confide in as her daughter or best friend. 

I've looked into living nearby the school (I am in California) and it's either too much or nothing available at all. The campus dorms are just way too expensive as well. I have nowhere to go if I want to move out but out of the state where my fiancé lives. We are long-distance till I am done with my bachelor's degree, but I'm not certain if I want to complete it yet due to my lack of options and my mental health deteriorating due to my home situation. 

I'm almost 21, and I would be finished with my degree early next December a week or two after Thanksgiving if I continued going to school here. 

My mother and brother are supposed to start therapy soon (my mom starts in 3 days) and my brother started going to the gym with me during the week. I encouraged him to reach out to a therapist soon for anger management but he kept blaming everything on my mother. 

Do you guys think it is valid to withdraw till I'm in a better mental state? I have 0 motivation to continue my studies and can't see myself doing this for another year here. I know two semesters isn't a lot, but I honestly don't think I have the strength to do it. I think I would transfer my credits to a degree that is offered online once I'm ready to give my degree another go. I just can't keep living here for too much longer or I might honestly lose my shit.",college,"After this term, I'll be 2 semesters away from graduating with the highest honors, but my home life and college are not where I want to be.

15,eittome,1663108207,/r/college/comments/xdkptj/how_do_i_appeal_fafsa_as_a_independent_student/,"Its a long situation but ill try to make this post as short as possible. I decided to go back to school at 24 because I couldn't afford it as a dependent student. Im now independent and got fafsa figured out. I was excited because after going through expenses of tuition with an advisor I would have money refunded back to me that would help me greatly with living expenses and books/supplies.

My tuition was way more expensive than expected because the fees were not included also my major has its own price too and on top of all that i have new student fees to pay. Most of my grants and a small scholarship went to pay just tuition. I was hoping for 4k refunded back but I got 2k back. 2k is alot of money but the town i live in is very expensive. To make matters worse my affordable university housing fell through due to overbooking so i have to look for housing at normal city rates. (Just for this semester im hoping ill to get it next semester). I do have work study but its capped at $1500 so that’s about $300 a month and I got a 1k subsidized loan and a 3k unsubsidized loan.

I did a bit of research regarding appealing my financial aid but the school’s website makes it seem like you can only appeal if you are in a very bad situation (deaths, accidents, having kids) OR if you are a dependent student and your parents are not cooperating, and that if approved for the appeal you’ll most likely just get a small a higher interest than normal loan to get by. The school I went to a few years ago just had a normal appeal, but my current school is so specific with appeals for some reason. Im assuming its to ward off students who want to negotiate offers, but its unclear why so specific.

Im an independent student with no assets (not even a car). My savings isn’t a lot because I have been working to pay off medical stuff. Based on my 2020 tax returns I didn’t work because of surgeries, and I lost my job because of the pandemic. I had a job before moving for college, but I worked for a lab and the pay was nothing. Also, as an independent I have no parents in the picture/parent help, and fafsa didn’t even ask for my parents’ information. So, I’m 100% on my own.

Basically my question is:

How do I appeal as a independent student when the schools website gives very specific reasons to appeal?

 I want to be awarded more grants for at least this semester until I stabilize myself and earn scholarships to help. I will even settle for a subsidized loan, but I am very hesitant regarding unsubsidized loans because of the interest rates. I already paying off debt with interest and I know how it adds up and I can’t imagine how much it will add up after 3 years until I’m done with school, its just setting myself up into a bigger issue in the long run. Its available if there’s an emergency but I don’t think it should be anyone’s go to especially since I’m going to a instate public university. I haven’t been able to buy any books, supplies or even a computer because I’m in a situation where I have to save for rent. I work 2 jobs and it will not be enough especially since I lost my affordable housing this semester. In the end its just a cycle because you worry about work and paying bills and you fail classes and loose fafsa too.

Please note that this issue with surprise costs has been an ongoing issue with many students at my university so I am not the only one (I also went through everything with someone at the university, so I did make an educated decision to come to the uni), but a lot of students can appeal because they are dependent of their parents and can use their parents to change their fafsa if needed. Also, my school has a lot of rich kids, I wonder if this is a reason why the school is strict regarding fafsa appeals but as a nontraditional independent student I feel forgotten in a way.",college,How do I appeal fafsa as a independent student when the schools website gives very specific reasons to appeal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xdkptj/how_do_i_appeal_fafsa_as_a_independent_student/,1663126207.0

It’s a private college with expensive tuition that I cannot afford alone, the jobs condition was that I remain full time.

The college is an online only college so I called them up and sent in a form with basic information about myself and okayed the college to ask my high school for my transcripts. The college needed my income verification but I had just gotten hired so didn’t have a paystub yet, they also needed FASFA and a letter agreeing to my jobs team thing. There was a deadline of august 28th? 

Anyway I called the next day and they told me my rep was too busy and he’d call later, no big deal. Never got that call. Called the next day, same ordeal. Okay. This time told no more than 5 days. I wait 5 days still no call so I call once more, still rep is too busy. No emails or anything. So I forget about it, I figured they didn’t want me to attend. In that timespan my job forcibly made all full timers part timers due to the budget not being able to afford full timers so now I definitely can’t afford this college.

Anyway both deadlines pass which was august 14th for FASFA and employer letter and august 28th for everyone else to submit applications.


I got an email yesterday from the college after a month of no word, it wasn’t a YOURE ACCEPTED but a if you’re accepted these are your actions and a if you’re not accepted yet here are your actions.

Now I’m confused, am I accepted? Do I have to formally tell them I no longer want to enroll? Did I enroll without knowing?

20,A-_-ok,1662334571,/r/college/comments/x613lh/help_need_helping_deciding_for_a_big_decision/,"Greetings,

Hope whomever is reading this is having a great day!

I need advice on a life changing decision, and thought seeking advice here could maybe help me with making that decision.

I am an international student studying in the USA. Since I was a kid I have always wanted to become an Engineer, that was my goal. But I could not get a good offer from a US university with an Engineering school. So, I choose my second option, which does not have an Engineering school. I came to that school last year majoring in Computer Science, though was not too happy with it, but it was still in the tech industry, which was my career path.

Throughout the last Spring semester, I applied to transfer to schools who have an Engineering school. Eventually, I got admitted into one the issue is, I got a bad amount of scholarship money, as it is a small tech school, but prestigious. This all happened during the summer, when I had a summer job. I have Arab parents, so as soon they heard “Engineering” they were happy and said we would help pay for the college, though they would be paying double the amount of money…. It was a hard decision to transfer as during the year I spent at my old university, I have met a great roommate, made a lot of friends, networked with the faculty, planned to study abroad, and was involved on campus. It was very hard for me to let all of that go, but my parents kept telling me to transfer as it is better “career” wise. Through their pressure and work pressure, I was basically working on the transfer form / process “blindly”, I was doing all the work but hesitant on the inside.

Now, I finally transferred and spent a week and took a few classes at my new school. Each day I was there I was in strong discomfort and not belonging. Some of the people here a bit weird and not social. They just like to go to class and come back and sit on their phone or PC. I have noticed that with my roommates, I barley know them because they do not talk…  

After all of this, I want to transfer back to my old school. I feel like this school is amazing, but expensive for my family. They said they can do it, but it is a risk. And I don’t want my family to struggle if a financial burden comes up, as they are putting a lot of money into this, and my home country is not a stable place in anyway, so those funds could be used in case of an emergency.

This is a story version of my long story. My parents were against the idea of me staying at my old school because, they think friends won’t go anywhere and I can meet new people. And I can leave study abroad and travel later, and most importantly, the new school is better academically. They told me not to think emotionally and think in the long terms (That Engineering is better than IT career wise). But after the one week I had at my new school, I feel unhappy and in discomfort. I feel like if I was to come back, I will still do study abroad with my best friends, enjoy that, pay 2 times less and study for a good degree, which is Information Technology. But I am stuck on that decision…

Is going back to my old school and studying IT for 2 times less the money (25K / Year) a good investment? Or shall I stay at my new Engineering school pay double the amount (60K / Year), and basically putting all my money in one place? (That Engineering school has great internship connections and a great return on investment rate.)

Lastly, I feel me and my family could use this money to maybe help me get an MA degree if I want, or help with my brother’s studies, or simply save it for anything. I feel like it is a big risk that my parents are putting most of that money into my education.

Could I be wrong and simply missing my friends and my old school? Or am I thinking logically / sustainably in terms of the costs?

Any advice or suggestions would be great! This is a very difficult and daunting decision for me because of how big / life changing it is…!

21,Fit-Orange-4136,1662233350,/r/college/comments/x52o5z/second_bachelors_or_masters/,"hey everyone. 

so i graduated with my first degree less than five years ago but i want to go back to school for a second bachelor’s degree for a few different reasons. 

a) i barely graduated with my first degree. i’m afraid that my grades are not good enough for graduate school in the slightest as my grades suffered in the second half of my college career due to some very difficult personal circumstances. now that i have turned my life around i feel like i will have a better chance to succeed. 

b) my degree didn’t really teach me or show me everything i wanted to learn about working in my industry. i want to study a different field that i think will be advantageous and to my benefit in pursuing my career goals. 

c) the second degree (masters or bachelors would make me eligible for more job opportunities. 

i’m stuck though. i don’t know if a second bachelors degree or a masters would be the better call. i feel like i’m too old for undergrad but not impressive enough academically for graduate school. 

plus with the current state of the world, going back to school at all just feels like a silly waste of time, even though i would love nothing more than to have another chance to study and do well academically and professionally. 

the masters would be more expensive and plus like i had mentioned i’m not sure if my grades would really be good enough for grad school. but i just feel a little silly going for an undergraduate degree at my age (mid 20s).

 i’ve seen some people from other posts say it would be a waste of time since most employers just want to see “a degree” and it doesn’t matter what the degree is actually in, though this hasn’t reflected my experience in job searching tbh. i’m just in a place in my early career where i feel stuck and i feel like i still have learning to do due to my circumstances and previous limitations. 

so second bachelors or masters? pros and cons? has anyone here done a second bachelors degree? 

i would sincerely appreciate any thoughts and insights. thank you all :)",college,Second Bachelors or Masters?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x52o5z/second_bachelors_or_masters/,1662251350.0

At my school, the CJ degree is in the school of liberal arts and I constantly hear people bashing liberal arts degree’s. I feel like criminal justice isn’t really liberal arts, however our school just needed to place it somewhere. 

The reason I’m asking is because I am a senior, and I regret a lot of decisions I made in college, including my degree choices. 

1. I started out in aviation, took a $13k loan to get my pilots license, and got it! But then I decided to switch majors because the aviation major was too expensive for me and I did not want to be almost 100k in debt. I should’ve saw this before but I was young and right out of high school and just thought flying would be cool. I do want to be a pilot as a career, but I want to fly for the military. 


2. I also have an interest in criminal justice, so when I changed, I decided to get my degree in CJ, however I do not know if I made the right choice or not because of the job opportunities IF the military for some reason doesn’t work out. Also, it is also more discouraging when I see constant slander about liberal arts majors. I understand getting a degree in music or art would be bad but is CJ bad?

Spoilers, this is about student loans and student loan forgiveness but I think this story is important to tell. For those who don't know me or know much about me, I am a mechanical engineer and I graduated from the University of Florida after 5 years of school there. Right now, I definitely have a great and very comfortable life, this has a lot to do with my career path as well as many other factors. I currently have 10 Professional Engineering licenses, have currently applied for my license in 4 more states and plan on applying for more, and I also have a Certified Safety Professional license. For most people the qualifications I have are like ""end game"" stuff, like pinnacle of their career and most people stop after getting any one of what I have which of course is not my style. All of that said obviously it was not easy getting here but, save for some of my closer friends most people probably don't know how hard it really was.  


Originally I had gotten early admissions into Virginia Techs Mechanical Engineering program when I was a senior in high school, of course like most HS students I was excited especially because the deal I had been told since elementary school was ""you get good grades and get into Virginia Techs engineering program and you will go there and go far"" and obviously I held up my end of the deal and got in, not only in but in early like before most of my friends even had the opportunity to apply anywhere. Fast forward to orientation, I was visiting the school with my mom and I was IN LINE to get my student ID. It was a dream come true, at that point I called to sort out the financial end of this journey and that's more or less when I learned that there was no money to pay for this and because I was out of state 4 years would be roughly $200,000 dollars with classes, books, rent, food, etc. I didn't even get my student ID what was the point. But more dreadfully I didn't apply anywhere else because why would I? I mean like I said... I HELD UP MY END OF THE DEAL. I knew that I got in the November of my senior year and you couldn't apply to FL schools until like Jan/Feb so I didn't need to. Granted most people would have probably taken a year off or given up or whatever I don't know I don't think that way, so I IMMEDIATLY set up a meeting at UWF who, at the time, DID NOT HAVE ANY ENGINEERING PROGRAM. I applied with literally 2 weeks before classes started, and thankfully I had a 4.28 GPA so the doors were swung open for me. I decided to ""create"" an AA degree that focused on Engineering pre-requisites (Calculus 1-3, Physics 1-2, Chemistry, ect.) and did it, I applied to UF and UCF and got into both (my GPA was like 3.8 or something so I was favorable) I of course chose UF as they are known for their stellar Engineering program. But, rewind to what started this situation, lack of money. I had been paying for UWF out of my own pocket entirely (no student loans) not in short due to the fact I could stay home and live rent and food free. But now there is the challenge of UF with rent, food, and a more expensive school. This is what my next 3 years was. I would serve tables/work at marinas/generally bust my ass EVERY summer. 3 months of getting as much money as I could. Then I would go to Gainesville in the fall and first thing was to pay THE ENTIRE YEARS worth of rent, then I would go to the student affairs office and pay for THE ENTIRE YEARS worth of classes. This way I would know exactly how much money I had left to survive for the rest of the year. 95% of my days were the same meals (save for special occasions/friends chipping in for a fun house meal) but those were, 2 eggs, 1 piece of white toast, and 2-3 sausage links for breakfast (most days), Nature Valley bar for lunch, Plain Peanutbutter sandwhich w/ pretzel sticks and red Gatorade made from powder for dinner. For 3 years. I rarely went out and when we did it was usually something cheap like $1 burger night at Mother's. I am glad I don't drink at all because I couldn't afford it, which also means I didn't really party in college (not that I cared) but the big whammy was I got through all 5 years of Engineering School with NO TEXTBOOKS. THAT FUCKING SUCKED, do you know how hard that is? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A FUCKING DIFERENTIAL EQUATION IS? DO YOU KNOW THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUCKIN AWESOME TO BE ABLE TO STUDY WITHOUT NEEDING OTHER PEOPLE? YEA FUCK I'M MAD THINKING ABOUT IT. I would see people fail a class and all I could think is ""how the fuck can you afford to do that?"". But I did it, I went through all 5 years and you know what. I toughed it out, I ""pulled myself up by my bootstraps"" or whatever bullshit people like to say. I paid for ALL OF IT MYSELF. I had NO BOOKS, I ate A METRIC FUCK TON OF PEANUT BUTTER, and I have NO DEBT, NO STUDENT LOANS, and I'm not going to lie...I have a GREAT appreciation for my degree and what I had to do to get it.  


Fast forward to now, like I said I am successful, have a great house, make good money, and am very very comfortable. And it did it all with no help financially, and worked very hard, and went through an ASS TON of struggles but I did it and would do it again. Blood, sweat, tears, pain, all of it, I know I could do it again if I had to and I know it CAN be done since well... I did it.   


So what about that guy who didn't work as hard as I did every year? The kids who  just took loans and could concentrate purely on studies and not worry about all the shit I had to worry about? The ones who got do have a crazy fun time and have a carefree college experience before entering the real world? Do I think they should get that money just GIVEN BACK, no issues? Where I worked like a dog and stressed out?  


Do I think student loans should be forgiven when I had it so bad? ABSO-FUCKING-LUTLY. I swear to god, I would pay ANY amount of extra taxes to make sure that NO FUCKING BODY has to go through what I went through. Your college years should be spent not only learning and guiding your life toward a career, but it should also be your ""last stop"" of pure carefree life before you start the real deal. And schools tuitions and books and all of that nonsense ROBS you of that. It robbed me of it. That isn't to say, I didn't have fun in college and made great friends and had good experiences. But god.... I cant even imagine how great it would have been if I had NO FINANCIAL STRESS.  


I will end this story with a quick counter argument to something I have read a lot in regards to Student Loan Forgiveness or Free College. And that is ""if its too expensive don't go to college do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" and you know what that argument is BS, I love math, I love engineering, THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO. and I DESERVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. As far as ""you don't need a degree though"" Like I said currently I have 10 Professional Engineering Licenses and have applied for it in MANY more states and you know what the first question after your name is? ""Where did you go to school, which engineering did you study, when did you graduate""  


So ya, for my life I absolutely needed a college degree, and yea even though I never had student loans, I absolutely think not only should ALL loans be forgiven, but all future tuition and books should be free. If we can bail out decrepit billionaires we can pay for our future citizens.

i struggle with social anxiety and making friends and i’m really worried that i’m just going to be sitting by myself at home all the time. they’re all making plans with their high school friends already so i’m just worried about stuff in the future (what’s new lol). i also won’t be able to go home until december/january because a flight home is way too expensive and i’m determined to finish school here since it’s costing me so much money already (aka no dropping out and giving up for me).

27,alenamalina,1660517737,/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,"So I'm in a bit of a weird situation. Last year, my major changed its requirements about two weeks after the drop add period and I basically finished my major first semester of junior year, and finished my degree requirements last semester. But I really didn't want to graduate early at all. First off, I had really bad mental and physical health issues, and I had actually been trying to take the past two years off for that specifically but my parents did not let me. Why I listened to them I'm not sure, since I pay for college and rent myself with financial aid and multiple minimum wage jobs. This was incredibly difficult, at one point I ran out of money and couldn't afford food, and I started having daily panic attacks and a couple of strokes because of it. But also, part of me was mad at my shitty three years of college and I wanted to have a normal year. I knew this year's tuition would be covered by financial aid and scholarships so financially it wouldn't even be that bad of a decision.

Regardless, I'm going into my fourth year majoring in International Relations. When I was making decision I also thought, hey this will be cheaper and better than paying rent at home and job hunting for a field that I know I cant get a job in yet because I don't have enough experience or connections. I can work and save up for my last year and continue to network, especially since the IR field really needs connections and college was online for year and a half.

But the problem is, I... kind of hate my major. I've hated probably since about second semester sophomore year and I've been too stuck mentally to change it. I know, it's completely my fault and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions, but it still sucks. I originally wanted to get a masters in IR and work for a think tank or for the state department, or maybe work for a nonprofit. At first I actually liked the major until I started learning about the corruption in the field. Honestly idk what I expected. I went to college to learn, not to necessarily train for a job. 

Now.. I just want financial stability. After being abused and harassed at my minimum wage jobs for so long I can't stand being financially unstable and I don't want a job that pays $40k after obtaining a graduate degree. When I first went into this my parents actually promised to pay for half my tuition and rent, but because of family issues I had to start supporting myself starting sophomore year. That shit is incredibly fucking difficult on around $11-12 an hour, especially when jobs refuse to give you enough hours. I am tired of working hard for terrible pay. Basically, after going from a family that was relatively well off to struggling to survive, my priorities have shifted. I no longer want to help people for work and I'd rather do some job I tolerate and do what I enjoy outside of work, including activism and learning about politics.

I've found that the only thing I really enjoy in this major is data analysis and research. I think working with R is fun and I never understood why people were struggling with it. This past summer I did some RA work for my professor and I'm doing my own research project this semester, and I'm also working as an RA for another professor.

So I've thought about a relatively different career path as a data scientist. I like working with numbers and I feel like this will make me a livable wage. I've thought about adding an information science degree, since it'll give me the skills I need to get into this field. But I've also thought about going into grad school. Here's where I'm unsure. Should I basically get a second bachelors in information science and go into data science, or should I just whatever classes I can in programming (like for R, SQL, and python), learn the rest on my own, and apply to grad school for data science? Or, can I learn these on my own and get a job in data science with just my bachelors in IR?

In terms of cost, I have this year's tuition and living accommodations covered, but I'm not sure that I'll get aid for my fifth year. I know I can potentially get a local scholarship and maybe a few grants, an interest free loan from a local scholarship, and I know that since this isn't technically my second bachelors I can also get loans from FAFSA. I've also thought about bootcamp, but to be honest its more expensive than what I would pay for one year at my state  university.

Is it worth the time and investment? Or am I just fucking stupid",college,Adding a major senior year,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,1660535737.0
28,throwaway10241123,1660436124,/r/college/comments/wnslz3/i_hate_my_college_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hey everyone. As I have about 3 weeks left until I go back to school, I am absolutely loathing the idea of going back, but I don’t know what to do about it. I really really hate where I go to school and it’s hard to deal with now that I’m back home (and loving it here).

I’m from Southern California but go to a large private university in NYC. It was my dream school, so I instantly decided to go there. It was extremely expensive, but I’m very fortunate that my family has the means to provide me with the education. That being said, while this school has given me a lot of opportunities, growth, and experiences, it turns out that I just really don’t like it.

In any case, I feel really stuck. The first factor is that I’ve landed an internship for next summer with a nearly guaranteed full time offer to follow. It’s a really great, high-paying program at a great and prestigious company. It’s also nearly impossible to get into, so I can’t let this opportunity go and try another time. The important thing is that it’s contingent on me maintaining my current course of education (same program at the same university).

The second factor is that since my family is paying for my college, they exercise a larger degree of control over my academic path. While they let me study whatever I want, they won’t let me take any gap semesters or years or anything like that. I suggested to them that since I have the credits from high school, I can take an upcoming semester off to recharge and can still graduate on time. They flatly rejected it with no argument. They would like me to transfer because they see that I’m not happy at my uni, but not with the needed gap year until next admissions cycle. Also, I can’t just go and not take their money, as my university costs so much that even with my high paying job after college I couldn’t afford to pay it back (not at these interest rates).

In any case, I just don’t want to be at this university anymore; I want to be somewhere closer to home in California, but it’s too late to transfer to anywhere at roughly the same level as the program I’m in (think UCLA, Berkeley Haas, USC Marshall) without waiting a year. I feel so stuck and don’t know what to do. I really can’t stand living in NYC and going to my university, but I have no recourse. I am trying to find ways that I can go online but my university is trying to be fully in-person again.

Most of our friends (including myself) are either in-state or live in a neighboring state. She has experienced a lot of culture shock in moving north and blames a lot of it on money. When we first met, I completely agreed. The northeast has a large wealth gap, leaving less of a middle class and making conditions very poor for the working class. While she is right about the northeast in general, it is not right how she takes her frustration out on individuals. Our friends are by no means wealthy and a vast majority pay their own tuition or take out loans. Personally, my parents were both unemployed for all of my high school years and as a result, I receive financial aid, plus I work two jobs.

She throws it in people’s faces a lot (“you would get it because you’re rich” “I’m not rich like you”) and all of our friends have agreed it is hurtful. As a result, she doesn’t pay people back unless they remind her several times and when she does pay them back, she complains people are “focusing on money too much.” Just this week, I let her use my card on a $100 grocery bill because she forgot hers and I had to remind her four times to pay me back, which she seemed very upset to have to do. It’s gotten to the point where she is talking badly behind all of our backs and pushing us further away.

When she is telling stories about her friends from home, there are a lot of details that sound completely out of reach for my economic situation, such as attending $500 music festivals twice a year or driving sports cars or touring Europe together for the entire summer after high school. She also gets checks in the mail from her family a lot and her parents even shipped her a BRAND NEW car as a surprise present last year (the surprise presents are really common. Her mom sent her three new pairs of EXPENSIVE shoes as surprises last year, too). She’s made fun of my car before (it’s about 15 years old) and when I told her it hurt my feelings, she said it’s “the one nice thing” she has and I’m “taking my life for granted.”

As I noted, before I knew her this well, I agreed with her that the northeast is incredibly classist and inaccessible for most people. I have no doubt she is experiencing culture shock. Still, she can’t insult people or ignore her own privileges. Every time I try to correct her about things (such as saying her friend whose parents own several large commercial rental properties grew up “poor”) she gets quiet or even angry.

I currently live in Texas, attending a CC, but will be transferring to UT-Dallas in Richardson, TX come January; without going into too much boring detail, I am in need of health insurance, preferably sooner rather than later. 

I do not qualify for Texas Medicaid - I applied last month and called today to see if there was an update and was told that, while it has not been fully processed and won't for at least another couple weeks, I do not qualify because I do not have a child. I am 24. I do not have a full-time job as I left my previous employer of over 4 1/2 years to go back to school full-time. I do work part-time/as needed as a substitute, but it doesn't make much when I have to consider gas money + bills. I file my own taxes, I have for years, so I cannot be claimed on my Mom's tax return. 

She does not have a health insurance that I can be placed on, either - she only gets coverage through the VA as she is a disabled vet. Dad is not in the picture. 

Does anyone, preferably also within Texas, also know of options I could look at? The $3.3k UT-Dallas offers annually will be a little too steep for me, as well. 

TLDR: I need health insurance, do not qualify for Texas Medicaid, cannot join my mom's plan as she just has VA coverage, and the insurance offered by my Uni will be too expensive.

I was optimistic. I chose the cheapest school I could find that supported my major. I had received two scholarships from my school. I qualified for federal aid. Perhaps it would all be enough to cover the cost of my first year. But it wasn’t. I received the bill, and to my dismay, came short by $12,000. I had never liked the idea of loans, having heard countless horror stories over the years, but I asked my parents to co-sign anyway. They refused and I’m inclined to believe that’s a good thing, as it made me reconsider wether college was really necessary, even if it would be easier than other options. (For my major it’s not, but I acknowledge that for some it is.)
                 I did a bit of research and a lot of calculating, curious to know what kind of outlook would await me had I been able to borrow loans for school. In the worst case scenario I would NEVER, ever be able to pay off the debt because the interest would outpace what I could contribute. In the best case scenario, it would take me 17 years to pay it off, if, and only if, I spent every single dollar I had on my loan. That would mean almost two decades barely scraping by, forced to give up any small joys in life. That would mean no fun trips and outings, no new video games or other personal items, no gifts for loved ones, not even so much as a movie ticket.
             But realistically it would be much harder than that to pay off because there would be necessities I would have no choice but to spend money on. Most household appliances and essential devices (such as a phone) are designed not to last longer than 5-7 years. I would have to replace something at least twice in that time frame. And a set of clothes lasts about 1-3 years depending on quality and how often it’s worn. That would mean I would have to pay for a new wardrobe at least 3 or 4 times. Each one of these purchases would push the time it takes to be debt free further and further. It would be quite possible, even, to find myself under the hand of the law if I simply couldn’t pay. 
               With these facts in mind, it’s safe to say that education is no longer about teaching the youth, passing knowledge to the next generation, nor empowering people with better career options. it’s about marketing, profits, and most importantly, lining the coffers of those who sit at the top. The only person benefiting is someone you’ll likely never meet, someone who certainly doesn’t care about you. 
          Yet people talk about student loans so flippantly, as if it isn’t completely disastrous for a nation to enslave the majority of its young with unplayable debt. From an early age we’re pushed in this direction. At first we’re asked what we want to be when we grow up. It’s an innocent enough question, but that’s not where it ends. We’re drilled all throughout school to achieve good grades because if you don’t, no college will accept you. In high school we’re told to join clubs because it will look good on college applications. Then we’re presented with aptitude tests to see what career we should pursue and as we get closer to our senior year, we’re hounded to pick one, assured that college is the only way we can obtain it. Afterwards we’re urged to apply to colleges and enter private scholarships we’re not likely to win. We’re sent home with pamphlets for our parents, informing them of all they need to know to fund our success, including loan options. Meanwhile, the whole time we’re being marched right into the gaping maw of a wolf. 
         The whole idea of higher education has become predatory. Why else would there be an entire market dedicated to private student loans? Surely they wouldn’t exist, or be as prominent as they are, if there was no one at the other end reaping in the benefits. Colleges also gain in this process because they know no matter how high their asking price is, students will still attend, enabled to do so by private loans. The schools get paid with no risk to themselves, meanwhile students build their futures overtop sinkholes. This incentivizes them to continue raising the price of tuition and fees year after year. And raise it they shall. Over the past couple years I watched as a few schools I had been prospecting raised their tuition by 10% per year. While other institutions didn’t take such a dramatic price hike, they still make a steady climb of at least a couple thousand per year. I doubt any one of them has a reason to quit anytime soon, and I imagine the same thing is happening in schools all over the United States.
          In the end, I chose to spare myself the nightmare and walk away, though I’ll be looking for less expensive ways to reach my goals. As a message to anyone reading this, think long and hard before you sign on that loan. Do your research, figure out how much your target career pays vs. the cost of living. Then take into account interest rates and how they’ll affect the overall cost of loans after you graduate. Remember that federal loans add up too. Look at all your alternative options.

+Fresh new start
+Programs more aimed to what I want to major in
+In a area where all the major companies in my craft are.
+Ability to test into my needed classes to still graduate in 4 years

-Is a public out of state school, is going to be similar to my old school as majority of people going there are from the state (feeling like a outcast)
-Still isn’t my preferred location but is still close to it.

+Is still in my state, cheaper and not to far away from home
+people here are from my state(not feeling like a outcast)
+If everything works out perfect (which I doubt) I can spend one more year at the school then try and transfer to my dream school but there’s no promise especially as a junior
-I messed up terribly, low gpa and credits might have to 5+ years
-Does not have the same major opportunity’s like the MD college 
-Rejected from every major and my intended one

+Try to transfer out after one year?
+Profit???????
+Might be able to take classes in my dream location

Some background information: I’m a senior in high school and I have a contract with my school because it’s too expensive for my parents to afford without financial help. It’s a very small school with only a few hundred kids in total. 

Throughout my years of highschool my contract has only required me to maintain above a certain gpa (which I’ve been doing) and to play in two of my school’s sports. However it only knocks off a very small percentage of the tuition anyway. I’ve gotten quite good at volleyball over the years because my mom forced me to do it but I’ve always hated it. My other sport of choice was softball because I’m actually quite fond of it. 

I always told myself that for my senior year I’d take it easy and finally stop doing volleyball and choose a different sport. I made the mistake of telling this to the sports director and he ended up telling the principal. The principal then sneakily changed my contract and added volleyball as a MANDATORY sport, and if I didn’t fulfill it my contract would be void. I hate volleyball because my mom makes it miserable for me and I don’t enjoy it whatsoever. 

Just to show how desperate they are for me to join: toward the end of this year when I didn’t want to go to the volleyball interest meeting for next year I had to hide in the bathroom because they sent people after me to force me into the meeting. However hiding didn’t work because they ended up threatening me to go. How nice. I just want to focus on my studies and not lose my mental health over doing a sport I hate.

I plan on making a document and presenting it to the principal as to why this entire situation is ridiculous in an attempt to get him to change it back to the original contract. Do you guys have any compelling information I could put in this document??? My friends and their parents said that what the school is doing is illegal but I don’t currently have any proof for that.

There is one program at MSU in Bozeman, but that is too far away and I cannot be away from my accounting job like that. I was looking at other programs, but out of state tuition is just so much more expensive! I see some online programs at schools like Eastern University. I know once you get into the work place essentially nobody cares where you went to school unless it was a very prestigious organization, but do you feel like a online schools like that are worth the money? If not, I am also open to an suggestions about universities or other options available.

41,OldOpportunity7492,1656306701,/r/college/comments/vlnpl8/feeling_incompetent_and_worthless/,"Hello. So this is a very raw, very insecure wall of text. I need advice on my very desperate situation. 

So i was a very good student all throughout high school. Good with maths, physics, biology. 

In the 2nd semester of 11th grade, quarantine hit. I stopped studying all together thinking I'm finally free from studying. 

I start painting again and keep doing it instead of studying.

I become pretty good at it, take commissions and such. Start seeing potential in taking commissions in dollars because USD is expensive in my country, and if i worked as an artist consistently I'd make better money than engineers and some doctors in my country (they're awfully underpaid, when you convert it to dollars. An average artists pay in dollars is much higher. So if i am paid by people who use USD I'm paid higher.)

I of course choose painting over studying again. I always knew I had no interest in any academic major, and hated studying despite being one of the top students. Just knew that I'd choose engineering if i had to choose one. So, easily i choose painting over that hell hole of stress and sleepless nights. Because I have a rough estimate of how it's gonna be based on my high school experience. Procrastination, laziness, stress, getting good grades but still feeling aimless. 

Here comes the university entrance exams, I'm delirious because I didn't study at all for the most important exam ever in someone's academic life. 

Get a pretty low score, it was expected though. It was all calculated. I would go into a major that pays well despite being easy to get into and easy to study, teaches valuable things etc. (Economy and finance) doesn't take too much of my time so I can spend more time drawing. And I would guarantee a 4 year university diploma by the time I'm 22, and maybe be successful in arts both level wise and financial wise. 

If i were to actually study for it though, and gotten a grade that i usually get in school, i would've chosen engineering, STEM. and I know I would've gotten it. 

But it just wasn't possible because of life circumstances (family being neck deep in depth, trying to make money from art so we could survive, telling me ""there's already an engineer in the family, becoming a doctor doesn't suit you, becoming a veterinarian doesn't shit you, what are you gonna do, stick a hand up a cows ass?""), and deciding to do art. 

Ever since i have gotten into the major I've been feeling highly insecure. I've been feeling sad to notice my scientific skills evaporate. I am aware that economics and finances is just not an impressive major. And I don't think it suits me at all. I know that I can get into a much better major, but people don't know. They assume im dumb and I hate it. I can see their energy change when i tell them i study economy and finance. I've even had a taxi driver tell me ""ew, what are you gonna do with that major? It's pointless.""  I hate it when people ask me what major I'm in or how much i scored on the entrance exam. I dread it. And it makes me angry because I don't deserve to feel this. I'm a good student, I'm smart, I'm hardworking. So why do I feel these things? Fuck. 

I'm starting to go practically insane. I'm considering retaking the exam to get into an engineering major that i know I won't enjoy, just to let people know that I'm not stupid. I feel people don't see my excellence in high school and how I was easily passing their architecture major daughter that they've been bragging about for 2 hours and comparing me to her. I don't like it.

People automatically assume my IQ is low. It's getting really irritating. I've not met my expectations in any area. Despite being a professional in art, despite having the highest gpa in my faculty across all business majors. I cannot feel satisfied and it makes me really sad. 

I hate being in the same major as people who couldn't care less to study. People who get all up in my DMS to ask for notes and how to solve a problem. 

It makes me feel like i wasted my academic potential. 

In terms of money, I'm good on that department, for sure. I make decent money from art. I've learned to crypto trade and make accurate observations (please don't make jokes about crypto-bro business major student, i cannot take it at the moment. Maybe later.) 

But i just cannot overcome this suffocating sense of INCOMPETENCY. 

So i look for solutions and one of them that is harder to solve is retaking the uni entrance exam. 

Okay, let's say I took it. I studied for a year (will reduce the time i spend drawing, learning to crypto trade etc.) Let's say I won the major in a good school. 

The score you get on these exams only last for a year, if it passes that then you'd have to retake the exam again. 

So let's say I got into the school, to show people that hey. I'm capable of this. This very thing that you accuse me of not being capable of. 

Then what? 

I would probably freeze the school. So i could continue drawing and doing my business in peace without this thing prying at the back of my mind every single day. 

Then what? 

Drop out of school? Go back to school and hate your life? Drop out and feel insecure that you don't have a degree? Get into the engineering major and maybe regret quitting econ and finances?

I have a feeling I'll feel insecure no matter what I do. 

How the fuck do I get rid of this?

(Sorry for poor English and grammar, not native and haven't slept tonight due to thinking about these things. I'm extremely sad at the moment. Not sure what i expect from this either, words of affirming? Strangers saying ""hey, don't sweat it."" I don't know. I just want someone out there to know about my struggling. I have no one to really talk to about these things, without them judging me. 

Thanks.)",college,feeling incompetent and worthless,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vlnpl8/feeling_incompetent_and_worthless/,1656324701.0
42,TK_Lax16,1655790190,/r/college/comments/vh5zqt/after_my_chaotic_freshman_year_i_am_evenly_split/,"The title pretty much sums it all up. If you look at my post history, you can find a trend that shows that my first year in college was, socially, chaotic. With the school year starting in September, it took me until March to find a solid friend group that respected me and considers me a good friend of theirs. This was not always the case. 

Beforehand, I had a very shaky “friend group” that quickly collapsed in of itself. Me and my  roommate were in this group. However, one of the members of this “group” (who we will address as Emma), took a bitter dislike to me for seemingly no reason. She would make fun of my clothes, my room, my shampoo, my passions, etc. She would also pride herself on being such a “good friend” for me while never once inviting me to anything. Overall, she was a complete bitch. However, my roommate (who I was originally really close friends with) ended up falling in love with her and have been dating since. 

Since then, my friendship with him has taken a complete nosedive to the point where it is pretty much ruined. This evil bitch turned him against me (long story that deserves a post of itself). This didn’t happen overnight, it slowly happened over the span of months. So even though this “friend group” was formed, it quickly fell apart after two months. As a result, my roommate and I, from November to around March, slowly formed a new solid friend group with actually great guys. Even though our original “friend group” fell apart, Emma could not leave me alone at all. She would constantly make up random, fake, shit about me. Such as the fact that I was, for some reason, planning to kick out my roommate from the friend group, I was apparently talking shit about him behind his back, that I am trying to ruin their relationship, etc. Unfortunately, he believed her lies over me, which is quite a shame. 

However, I did find solace in the fact that this friend group of mine is now solid and will most likely not fall apart. However, this year for me was way too dramatic and chaotic (in both good, but mostly bad ways) for me. Since we are all rooming with each other next year, including my former roommate, I am afraid the drama will live on even though we all hate my former roommate’s girlfriend. 

Furthermore, I am afraid that the college I am at will not give me the experience I want. It’s a small school, less than 5,000 undergrads with no nationally ranked sports teams and also does not have Greek Life. It’s technically near a town, but the town sucks. There is nothing to do for college aged people, the town is mostly designed for families and the elderly. Everything is expensive af, there are no bars, and all the stores and restaurants close by 9, sometimes 10 on special occasions. There is virtually no party scene that I like. The only “parties” that happen on campus are crammed gatherings in dorms or off-campus housing. They’re boring, uneventful, unenjoyable, but the only type of “parties” to occur. Because of this, many students take Ubers and trains to other colleges to have fun. It’s not that bad of an idea, but it is VERY inconvenient to do so and I am tired of going bankrupt because I am spending lots of money on Ubers to get to and from places (before I even spend money on my night out).The academics of the school are fine though, as well as the commute from my home (I am a residential student by the way. I mean “commute” as by traveling to and from the school for holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc). ",college,"After my chaotic freshman year, I am evenly split down the middle on whether or not to transfer schools and have endlessly debated about this for months.

Being totally honest here if my tuition wasn't paid for by Bright Futures I wouldn't have even bothered with this bullshit. Florida education is only good for one thing... getting a job in Florida.

When I was applying to Uni's I was pretty much told ""I ain't paying for shit"" by my single mother, so I ended up going to a shitty commuter school 40 min away from my house. She refuses to file the FAFSA cause she's kind of fucking crazy (still love her tho). Going in I had no clue wtf I wanted to do, ended up changing majors 4 times, starting with Computer Science to Biology to Psychology to Business Analytics and finally settling on Management Information Systems. Going onto my 4th year with 12 classes left which I'll probably finish in 2 more years (5 years total in college) cause that's how long my scholarship'll be good for + it's easier, don't really care that much since I'll still be graduating at 22. 

Point is I fucking hate it here, I don't spend much time on campus because 

* A. I just wanna go home or somewhere else, after class I always feel like I've spent too much time there 
* B. It's a shitty Florida University that doesn't even have a football team (Every single U.S. University pumps most of their budget into their Sports teams. Considering that this is a Florida university we're talking about that speaks volumes about the quality of education I'm receiving) 
* C. I've always felt like I could've gone somewhere better If I went into more debt. Would've been a stupid idea considering how much I think College is a scam but ik it would've made a more enjoyable college experience.

Cause of my lack of campus involvement and a good amount of virtual classes (cause why waste gas driving 40 min to and back) I've pretty much made 0 friends here. I still hang out with homies from HS and some other peeps, but I literally have no incentive to go out of my way to talk to people. The clubs are also shit too, not much variety.  Also doesn't help that I see a lot of people I went to Highschool with, kinda makes the experience feel even more lame. The worst part is not only do these fucking vampires force most people into debt, they make us VOLUNTEER on top of it. Imagine being someone that takes out $6000+ in loans a year for bullshit along with working a job to pay rent, to be forced to do over 100 hours of volunteer work like you're still in highschool. The real kicker here is that you're not even guaranteed a job once you graduate, only 50% of graduates are employed. That just shows how much the boomers have leeched our opportunities, only 13% of those old retards went to college and they made more money in their prime than Millenial and Gen Z combined. This shit should be free. Paid for by the tax money that goes to the Military industrial Complex and Israel instead of the American People. If you don't support free college you could say the same shit about Highschool, which BTW a College degree now is the same thing a Highschool degree was back in the 60's and 70's (back when it cost almost nothing). Too bad we live in an Oligarchy where politicians would rather give tax cuts to their corporate donors instead of giving us Healthcare.

Now you may be wondering ""Why aren't you taking advantage of campus networking?"" Well because I honestly don't give two shits about my education. My reason for going to college was 50% parental pressure (Angry Cuban Father (who died when I was 12) was a dentist with an Ivy League degree and my mom has a bachelors in Bus. administration) and the other 50% me thinking It'd be stupid to skip out on the 100% free tuition I got for getting a 30 on my ACT. 

Were it up to me I would've majored in History. I'd actually feel engaged with what I'm learning + my biggest strength has always been writing. Why didn't I do that? Waste of a scholarship. There's two types of degrees: Degrees that force you into becoming a k-12 teacher or ""Job Training"" degrees that can get you a decent paying job (Engineering + Business). That being said I actually like learning about the Business world a lot, the information system aspect not so much. But the Truth is I don't see myself making a career out of this degree at all. Fuck graduate school too as Sam Hyde once said ""Thats the loser route"", a massively expensive time waster. I've always hated school, why tf would I want more of it? I'd just wanna make money at that point.

I believe in this life we either follow our dreams or we live out our lifespan. Working as a Systems Engineer sounds fucking boring. If I'm still having to write job applications in my mid 30's that's a big sign I didn't work hard enough on my goals when I had youth. The 9-5 is Creative Suicide, fuck real jobs (btw before any of you call me lazy I worked retail from Sophomore to Junior year on top of taking 12 credits per semester, I HATED that shit XD ). In an ideal world I'm some famous Hideo Kojima guy who's created a badass IP with comics, video games, anime, tabletop rpg's, etc. (We'll have to see how that turns out lol) 

I'll probably work a job or two given by my degree (has to at least be 70k salary), until I have enough money to start working on my actual dreams. Who knows if Florida's the right place for that though, opportunities and getting the right people to work with is all location dependent. 

Bottomline is I think I've wasted a good 3 years of my life, going on 4.5 to 5 in the near future. College is what you make of it, and personally I haven't made jack shit. Why? Cause it really wasn't for me.  Also let's be real here EVERY single thing you learn in college could be learned online or through books, even better if you find the right person who can teach you the skills necessary to follow your dreams. MENTORS &gt; COLLEGE. A burden will be lifted off my shoulders once I graduate, I'll probably have more time for personal endeavors. Hopefully whatever job my degree gives me doesn't completely suck that away from me.

45,Timely-Sundae4419,1654186890,/r/college/comments/v3cmtb/just_got_dismissed_from_nursing_school_need/,"Hey guys and Congrats to all the new grads!

So, I recently just got dismissed from my nursing school due to not bringing up my GPA to 3.0. I was already on academic probation from last year fall semester due to getting a C in my Pathophysiology class and it dropped my GPA below 3.0(in my program all classes nursing and prereqs must be a C+ or higher). I retook Patho this past spring and was able to get a B-, and a B in my Microbiology class, but unfortunately, it only got me to a 2.9 GPA, so when the semester ended, I received a dismissal email.

They gave me 2 options:

**1)**  **If I want to continue in**  **the fall with a change of major, I must meet with a new advisor and my academic record will be re-reviewed to determine my academic standing for the upcoming semester by July 17**  
**2) Submit an appeal letter to the Academic standing committee and submit a letter of support from the Nursing Chairperson by June 27**

OK, so I made the decision in April that after the spring semester was over, I had no intention of returning back to this school because it’s just way too expensive. I found a bridge Nursing program at my local community college( I also attended this college a couple of years ago and received a Liberal Arts degree in 2020, then transferred to this private 4-year I'm at now) that is partnered up with a 4-year college that allows students to get their bachelor’s degree within 1 year ½ after the completion of the associate's degree. I think this is a better option for me because I won’t have to spend as much money on tuition and I can work in a hospital after completing my 2 years and still be enrolled in receiving my bachelor’s degree.

**I wanted to complete 2 semesters of classes to boost my GPA at this community college FIRST, then maybe next year Fall I would apply for the community college nursing program**

**So, is it worth appealing this when I have no intentions of returning back to this school?**

**Should I transfer to this community college or admit as a new student?**

**Any advice is greatly appreciated, Thank you!**",college,"Just got dismissed from nursing school, need advice pls",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/v3cmtb/just_got_dismissed_from_nursing_school_need/,1654204890.0

We have this one prof who in the beginning, was no show at all for three weeks at the start of the semester. We've messaged her about it, and it took her an additional 2 more weeks to schedule a class for some reason. 

When the day of her first planned class happened to be on student week, where online synchronous class can't be held, she didn't bother setting a definite date at all when the class will be rescheduled. She didn't even bother posting recordings, or material for us to work on by ourselves in the meantime.

Now, she's set a class on the second to the last month of the semester, and I didn't attend. This was last Saturday. Some of my classmates attended but most of us were so turned off by her rude behavior of not doing her job so we skipped. She didn't even give a new assignment at the time and now she's messaging us asking if a 3pm-8pm class would be feasible, which is COMPLETELY out of her schedule slot on the roster.

TLDR:
&gt; 0 Class meetings until recently
&gt; No modules or lessons properly given
&gt; No explanation or examples for some assessments
&gt; Never follows her class schedule
&gt; The Part-time Prof package

She's only given one real assignment and that was towards the middle of the semester where we had to follow a step by step tutorial but that was it. The only assignment we had in her class. 

Is it even worth it to attend her class at this point? Because honestly we've told our adviser about her behavior and nothing was done at all. Feels like the school doesn't give a hoot and all we can do is tank this prof during evaluations. I'd rather focus on my classes where the prof actually shows up as well as my thesis.

I recently just finished my degree a year early (thank god). She’s still undecided on what to major in and what school to go to. Her family makes too much to qualify for low income aid, but I think she’s too focused on “the college experience” and “dream school” thing to consider the weight of the decision when it comes to the big things like finances. Her big brother recently finished up his first year at college, who did the same thing with picking the school he wanted before getting an award letter. Their parents took out a 10k loan to send him to school, and next year they’ll do similar I imagine for her (hopefully, they could definitely do a 180). She’s even taking dual credit courses which is great, but isn’t considering whether or not they’ll transfer to the schools she’s looking at and whatnot. For the record, her brother goes to WVU tech. The two schools she’s considering is Marshall and Shepherds Univ (both in WV), and from what I’ve heard is that both are notorious for not giving much aid. 
It’s completely her decision, but I feel it should be an informed one. I was wondering if anyone here went through something similar and could share how their experience went. I just don’t want her to waste money or time by ignoring reality, that’s a tough lesson to learn.

As the title suggests, I’m a full on arts, humanities kid with many philosophy classes under my belt. Science always fascinated me and I love the ocean, animals in it, and just knowing how nature works. I just never felt smart enough to go the science route. Friends and family have recognized me for my talent in the arts, music, and overall being an abstract thinker. Art school was too expensive, went a different route, loved my ethnic studies courses, department, colleagues, don’t regret it at all and it lead me to many opportunities. 

Of course it’s difficult to find work with it without being a teacher or social worker or something along those lines and I found myself in marketing, comms, and data work. I HATE IT! Now that I’m older and years out of college, I’ve learned better study habits and wanting to make choices of my own and reach for those goals that felt impossible because I already limited myself to being an artist, not a scientist. 

I’m beyond excited to absorb new knowledge and be a fresh sponge but I’m terrified of not being “smart enough” to understand the course material. Meeting with my faculty advisor tomorrow.

53,Brian-the-Burnt,1651675845,/r/college/comments/ui8chl/im_39_i_just_finished_my_first_degree_after_a_25/,"I set a goal to finish my first degree before my 40th birthday, and now that final grades have posted, I can officially say that I am a college graduate with an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming. My final semester was 25 credit hours and consisted of the following courses:

* **Assessment Prep 1CR** - this is a 1-credit course that is essentially a big study group in order to earn some industry certification related to our field. It depends on your major, i.e. Networking majors will take CompTIA Network+, and so forth.
* **C# Programming (with lab) 4CR** 
* **Java Programming (with lab) 4CR**
* **C++ Programming (with lab) 4CR** - this one was probably my hardest class the whole time I've been in school thus far. Pointers are welcome to return to hell at their earliest convenience. The exams were also extremely difficult in this class.
* **SQL Programming (with lab) 4CR** 
* **Windows Operating System: Client (with lab) 4CR** - relatively easy, but a ton of assignments. This one was integrated heavily with the TestOut Windows Client Pro course.
* **Microsoft Office Applications (with lab) 4CR** - relatively easy elective because the rest was quite heavy.

I was able to finish this semester with a 4.0 GPA by having no life whatsoever. I don't recommend this for most people because it was hard. Really hard. And I didn't go from 12 credits to 25 the next semester, either. I started with 17, 11 (summer, so accelerated 8-week classes), 21, 25. The ramp up helped me find my tolerance levels and get experience in what I could handle as I went. 25 was *almost* too much; I finished with a 4.0, but C++ was a weak A the whole second half of the semester.

As I mentioned, I wanted to finish up my first degree before my 40th birthday, which was about 2 years from when I started. After I started, I decided I wanted to go faster, and then I decided I wanted two degrees. I've finished one and finish the other when they offer my last class to complete the program in Fall 2022 (AAS Software Engineering).

I have been accepted at Oregon State University in the Computer Science program, so that's the next step on the journey. I'm still in the process of getting everything together for admissions, filling out scholarship applications, and so forth, but I hope that a lot of my credits will satisfy transfer equivalency because non-resident university is much more expensive than resident community college.

If no one has any questions or comes here looking for my experiences as an adult student going back to college after many years, here goes:

* You're only too old if you decide you're too old.
* You will feel like the old guy/gal in class, and you will think people are judging you. *They are.* That's what people do. Not all of them, but you know. **Focus on the goal.**
* Older people are scared to go back because they are afraid their ""old"" brain won't be able to handle new information. Nonsense. You just need to start using those parts that you haven't been using. Much of what you did will come back, and you'll learn a lot more.
* Take a degree that you can use to enhance your life, your career, or that you can use to get a better career, and don't throw yourself deep into debt. As an adult learner, you have an advantage in budgeting, finance, and life experience. **Use those skills and make it happen.**
* You're older, and long experience has revealed everything you like and everything you don't. You're in a great position compared to most college students because you know what majors fit you, or at the very least, you can throw out the majors you know you will hate with cheetah speed.
* This is so important that I'll say it again. **FOCUS ON THE GOAL** I've had the self-doubt, the questioning, the imposter syndrome, the depression, and everything else that comes along with it. This is a major change in your life. It's going to be weird sometimes.
* And my biggest excuse before I started, and I told myself this for years: *It just takes **so long** to get a degree. I'll be X age when I finish.* So? And once you get started, it goes quicker than you think. Think of how fast time has flown up to this point and then tell me that a couple years is too long. And besides, I finished one degree and I'm one class short on another after 3 full terms and one summer session. If it's too long for you, there are ways to speed it up.

If anyone has any questions or needs advice, ask away. If not and you just came to read the story, thank you for taking time out to hear my story. And since most here are also in college, I want to wish you the best of luck in your education, your career to follow, your exams if you haven't finished them all yet, and your life going forward. &lt;3",college,"I'm 39.

54,UpAHillToTheRight,1651645936,/r/college/comments/ui0cxy/roommate_issues_is_it_common_not_to_talk_to_your/,"A brief backstory: My first semester at my brand new university (I was a 1st-year Junior when I moved to my first dorm) I had a quad-style dorm with 3 other roommates. 2 fizzled out, and I was left with just 1 for a bit. 3 days before the semester starts, we randomly get a 3rd, and we all felt like we clicked right away. Things were good for about 2 weeks, and then the 3rd me and the one roommate were not getting along. I feel like I have an opinionated, yet reasonable personality, but she had a opinionated and non-reasonable personality, so we just were kind of clashing a lot. That 3rd week she got very aggressive with me (I do think drugs/alcohol were involved) and I decided it best for me to just switch rooms. After the room switch, I noticed she posted some nasty stuff about me on social media (just messy, fake stuff trying to incite more things) so I got an order of no contact against her and obviously blocked her promptly after I moved out. This order prevented both her and I from ever directly talking to eachother on socials, tagging, etc., as well as in real life. Also, we were not allowed to talk through 3rd parties like mutual friends.

After this, I got placed in a room with 2 other girls who were friends and roomed before. They knew each other well, partied together, were heavily involved with frats/sororities, etc. and I don't think either was super serious about school since they seemed to party 3 days a week, every week, skipped classes frequently, etc. This is not an issue for me though, nor was it ever, although I am (and was at the time) 21+ and they did ask me to buy alcohol for them, to which I refused, and they seemed a little annoyed. It never felt like there was problems between us, although they did act a little distant, sort of ignore me and not really include me with their plans, etc. I understand they aren't obligated to invite me, so I never really counted it against myself, however obviously it would've been cooler if they would have included me. Again, I didn't really care about this too much as I usually don't party/go out every week and only feel like doing it occasionally. This being said, I did offer to take them with me  shopping and made an effort to include them or try and help them out since I did understand that they didn't have cars with them or means of getting to the stores they may have wanted to. I just tried to be pleasant all around. (Please also note, I wasn't trying to be weird and asking ""can I come with u guys"" all the time. For the most part, I only asked once or twice and they said that things prohibited me from coming to the parties, which I felt was kind of a lie, so I never really asked again.)

Flash forward to one day, immediately after getting pretty drunk at a bar with friends, I come back late and leave my washcloth hanging off the shower caddy and clearly made a mess on the counter from getting ready for bed. I know this is gross and annoying, but being drunk is sort of my excuse in this case. I had an event to go to at 5 am the next morning, so by the time I woke up and got dressed, I'm out before I even remember to clean up the counter. I obviously got a text later that said that my roommates needed to talk to me. (Also, before anyone addresses it, I totally get it that we all pay expensive rates to live in a dorm, and I should not be subjecting them to my messes. I totally get that, however it was, over the course of all but 3 weeks in 2 semesters, only once and I made a very clear effort to never do it again. It was just a busy night, busy morning, and it was cleaned up in less than 24 hours.) Nonetheless, I swallowed my pride and prepared to allow my roommates to say whatever they wanted to me, and not say anything back really, even though I did, deep down a bit, feel like they had their own set of issues I would address at a totally different time. (They both ate my food pretty consistently, helped not only themselves but their guests to my drinks, some alcoholic ones included, to which I just promptly stopped buying eventually after I realized, and they did leave some of their own messes occasionally as well, to which I'll get into later). The talk never happened, which I was actually sort of bummed over because I did want to apologize for it, and all of our busy schedules sort of never allowed it to really be discussed again in the future. I never felt like held hard feelings or grudges, it was sort of forgotten and we all still remained relatively pleasant.  

Flash forward to next semester, the roommate who originally asked me to talk ends up moving out due to some unrelated problems. For about 3 weeks into this semester, I live with the other roommate who recently acquired a bf. She proceeds to leave trash around the apartment pretty much daily, never changed her trash can (that was actually mine that I let her use, obviously) which eventually acquired an odor from the feminine products in it, and she and her bf even left used condoms laying around some places too. I almost didn't want to say anything to her because I'm quite sure her bf was the one responsible, but I was really getting to my wits end with her and her boyfriend closer to that 3 week mark. She eventually tells me her best friend upstairs had a bedroom open that she was moving into, so I would inevitably live alone in my 3 bedroom dorm ( was totally cool with it btw). Also please note, the semester prior, with that other roommate, I did inquire about something she was doing which resulted in her snapping very aggressively at me, threatening me, trying to incite a physical altercation, etc., so that's why I was very apprehensive about bringing up an issue with this roommate. Like, I'd just been through a lot and wasn't really prepared to deal with the fallout yet again. 

Now, the issue comes in now with the aftermath. Obviously I blocked and deleted the aggressive roommate from all social media, but I did notice that slowly I lost contact with all other roommates. One deleted me from social media (not upset, just curious), another one I'm pretty sure blocked me months after she eventually moved out (also not upset, just sort of interesting), and the one who moved out last sort of never really talks to me and we just kind of avoid eachother now. 

I get with the circumstances that happened why some might have chosen to delete me, but I'm just confused as to why really? I don't feel like I did anything that warranted being blocked, but then again I don't really know what happened. She could have deleted all social media, I just don't know. I get roommates don't always stay in contact, but I really don't feel like I've deserved to have been avoided like this? I wouldn't say I'm hard to live with or anything, I try to be positive and bright, but for some reason roommates and I have never seemed to click... Is this common for any of you? Also, if there's any tips or reasonable critique, I'm happy to take it. :) I just am struggling with my mistakes and it's sort of making me feel bad even though I tried my best to fix all of them.

Hi reddit,
I have to decide in the next few days if I should stay at my current college. 
I went Out of State for college, about 7 hours away, and it has been alright. I made a few good friends and am doing great in classes. I just don’t know if it’s still the place for me and I miss home a lot. I came here with my brother but he ended up transferring, and I would’ve gone to a different school if it weren’t for him coming here too.

Pros of Current School:
-More opportunity for growth
-Have made a few great friends that I don’t really want to leave behind.
-Safer campus
-No kids from my Highschool lol
-Better housing

Pros of going to school closer to home:
-Have some great hometown friends
-Closer to family
-Better at sports
-Better location; in the city, not a small town.
-Better social scene

My current school is a tad more expensive but only by a few thousand dollars. So don’t worry about that. Also both schools have my desired majors. 
I want to add that I love the friends I’ve made here, but I feel like they’re the only thing keeping me here.",college,Should I transfer colleges?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ufroo7/should_i_transfer_colleges/,1651396140.0

This happened to me at all 3 math courses I took at university and without lectures I failed every one of them. 2/3 professors refused to help me. For me it was especially hard because I have a learning disability and have autism and ADHD. I was homeschooled as a child and wasnt diagnosed with any of these issues until I was an adult.  I ended up having to drop out of university after 6 years in college just because I couldn't pass the math. I ended up owing around $50k in student loan debt (still do) living paycheck to paycheck.  To this day it infuriates me the math department head and the teachers are still employed by that school. I read their reviews on rate my professor (math department head is a calc teacher there) and see so many students saying the same things about them I did.   


Last semester I wanted to learn more about computers so I took an introduction to networking course at community college. My boss was nice enough to pay for me to take this class (on the condition I send him the course materials so he could learn too). I loved my professor. He was a nice guy. Class met twice a week. He would give a lecture on Tuesday and Thursday the class was a Cisco lab where we went into a server room next to the classroom and hooked up cables to switches and went back in and hooked up cables to laptops. These were group assignments. On the surface it would seem the class was more hands on but the problem I dealt with was all the homework was using this online software program called ""TestOut"". Basically you had to set up computers in a virtual lab online. The problem was this was supposed to be an in person class. If I wanted to learn it online I would have taken an online class. I didn't really learn anything from this class because my learning style does not absorb information that way. I need to get my hands involved. Why couldn't we be setting up cables on the actual computers? We were doing commands on a laptop with Cisco software but we couldn't have a few old desktop PC's we could take turns configuring?  


I just think if you take in person that means you want the in person experience. I don't know why colleges do this. It especially hurts those of us with special needs. Not everyone can learn from memorizing a bunch of stuff. I suck at learning that way. All the classes I ever did well in were project based classes. Like essays, powerpoints and speeches, even science labs (depending on the lab). The classes I struggled most in were the ones like math where you were bombarded with huge volumes of information. I also feel like colleges let down a lot of people with the one sized fits all learning approach. I hold universities to higher standards though.

65,ThatBroadcasterGuy,1648856538,/r/college/comments/tu4ziw/ive_been_thinking_about_going_to_college_but/,"I've never been to college at all, out of high school (graduated in 2013) or otherwise. The primary reason is because I didn't buy in to the hype about college. In my mind, I thought of colleges as money-grubbing organizations that prey upon naive young adults. My view on that has softened since then, however. I'm also somewhat of a nonconformist whenever it's practical to do so.

So instead of going to college, to a broadcasting school whose program lasted only one year. That was certainly better than spending four years cooped up in lecture halls and being buried in books and racking up mountain ranges of debt, right? I graduated from that program in April 2015, and started looking for jobs in the broadcasting industry. Radio or TV, it didn't matter. I should mention that I've never had a paying job before in my life. I was hoping that by going into broadcasting I could avoid a minimum wage job and jump right in to a career.

Fast forward to 2018, and I couldn't find one single position in the broadcasting field that didn't require experience. Needless to say, I felt defeated and gave up on broadcasting entirely, coming to the conclusion that broadcasting was just a passing interest and something I didn't want to seriously pursue.

I have since switched my interests to the IT field. Seeing the happy and successful lives of the people I went to high school with who went to college has caused me to reconsider my decision not to go to college.

Now, here's where the ""but..."" in the title comes into play. College (here in the US) is expensive, as you all are probably aware. Like really, really expensive. If I'm going to spend that much money on getting a piece of paper, it'd better be worth my while. I don't want the same thing to happen where after graduating (in four years!) I can't find a job in my chosen field and have to start all over again, with even more debt than I did going in. I already have student loans to pay off from the broadcasting school. I simply cannot afford to take on even more unnecessary debt. Maybe IT turns out to be yet another passing interest. Then what happens after that? Change careers and go back to college for four MORE years and rack up even MORE debt? No, that would be ludicrous. Four years is a very, very long time to spend learning. In that time I could be doing things that are much more productive than sitting in class. Am I focusing to much on the cost? Maybe. But I think that completely ignoring it isn't helpful.

And it's not like any competent college would accept me anyway. It's been less than a decade and my HS transcripts, ACT scores etc. are probably in a landfill somewhere by now. In addition, I'm 28 and by the time of graduation (if I started now) I'd be 32. That's just way too old and the admissions people would kick me out of the building the first chance they get. I'll admit that that's probably an irrational fear, but you get the idea.

I'm autistic. Mildly so, but still autistic. I did have some interest in going to college after high school, but my parents said they would move there and physically visit me every day. That's something I just couldn't abide. Isn't one of the aspects of college life learning to live away from home? Least in my view it is. I believe I could live away from home if given the chance, which I haven't gotten all my life.That's another factor which influenced my decision not to go to college.

I could go on but I think it's time to conclude this post. Am I totally missing the point? Are there ways to get higher education without incurring mountain ranges of debt? Are there ways to ensure that I have the best shot possible of landing a career? Is college less boring and mind-numbing than I think it is? Am I overthinking all of this?

66,judgejurythief,1648567624,/r/college/comments/tr4kpj/transferring_as_a_freshman_or_sophomore/,"Hello, I want to ask a general opinion. I’m a a freshman art student at a private art college thinking of transferring to a public college.
Would it be best to submit a transfer application for the fall 2022 (right now) or spring 2023 (during my 2nd year) semester? 

Currently I only have uploaded grades from last semester (fall 2021) and an art portfolio. I have the minimum gpa and college credits but I’m not sure if I should wait until I have more grades to show for.

Also, it’s extremely close to the deadline and I’m trying to get transcripts together in a rush. But since transfer applications are a bit competitive, I kind of want to see if I get accepted so I’ll have the choice for next semester. My current school is somewhat expensive and if I get accepted I would like to have the option to save the money.

Can anyone give me advice? It would be great if an art/GD student or transfer student can give me insight.

I have something that I have been working on lately and need some advice. I want to go back to school for a career change and get a certificate in Financial Planning. My end goal is to get my CFP and become a financial planner and work mostly with investments. However, I have two options available to me. I'm hoping that one of you could help me with this.

**Route 1 (Go to school)**: I currently live in Utah and a college close to my has the third-best Financial Planning program in the entire country. The program and faculty are highly ranked and the department consistently wins competitions in Financial Planning on the national stage. The Cost also wouldn't be too expensive compared with education in the US. The program would take about a year and I could take classes in the summer as well. The benefit of taking classes in the summer would be that tuition is lower. All in all, I think it would cost like $16,000 for tuition for the entire program. The program also has a 90 % placement rate, and the 10 % that doesn't get a job don't do so because the Personal Financial Planning in Utah is saturated. This means that I would be more likely to leave the state after I finish. All in all, I think this would be a good move.

**Route 2 (Find work)**: Utah is a nice place but it is getting really expensive. The cost of a home is already 600k. I honestly don't see a future for myself here. I have been thinking of moving somewhere a little cheaper and finding a job in a financial institution as a financial advisor. Some companies like Fidelity Investments actually offer a tuition reimbursement program if you want to obtain your FINRA Licenses and CFP, as well as having great benefits overall. I don't know how hard it is to get a job, though with little experience in the Financial Sector. 

So this is what I'm up against. What do you guys think? Do you think it would be more advantageous for me to stay in Utah for an additional year and get this certificate? Or do you think I should move, get a job with a company and work while they pay for me to go back to school?",college,Should I go back to school or find a job,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tosl49/should_i_go_back_to_school_or_find_a_job/,1648325676.0

I graduated in June 2021 with a Finance degree and coming up on one year with nothing to show for it. The pandemic screwed up my internship search and so I was never able to do one while in college. Before the pandemic I was working low skill jobs like amazon warehouse and grocery stockrooms to pay the bills. When the pandemic started I focused on just finishing strong since there was a lack of opportunities. I've been applying to financial analyst jobs ever since graduation and have had a total of maybe 10 interviews since then.

 My most recent being 2 weeks ago. The team told me they loved my background and would like to talk to me again after I've gotten some experience. They suggested I seek out an internship in corporate finance and then call them up after I finish that. The problem is I don't qualify for internships now that I'm almost a year out of school. 

I come from a blue collar family and was the first to go to college. I chose Finance because of the lucrative career possibilities but underestimated how hard it actually is to break into this field. I feel like I shot myself in the foot by not going into Accounting, and now I'm considering going to grad school for a Masters in Accounting. I feel like I know what to do differently this time and it would be my second chance to get it right. An expensive second chance but a second chance nonetheless. 

A lot of my friends from college have been struggling too. A good number of them went straight to grad school or will be going this fall for a second chance. The ones who are employed are in fields unrelated to their major.

69,ECdudis,1647296770,/r/college/comments/te9j38/global_young_leaders_conference_at_george_mason/,"Hi! I don't know if this right sub to ask to, but I don't know where else, so if you know a better subreddit for my question please redirect me there. Anyway, so back in January I got an invitation to attend the Global Young Leaders Conference(GYLC) at George Mason University in DC and NYC, and today in school I got a letter which contained the invitation and some other promotional material For those of you who don't know what this is, according to their page it is:

*Set yourself apart in today’s globally competitive world. At the* ***Global Young Leaders Conference (GYLC)****, you will be inspired to expand your horizons by fully exploring cultural differences, gaining firsthand exposure to the challenges of international diplomacy, developing your passion for international affairs while exploring a future career, and gaining a fresh, new global perspective.*

*This 10-day leadership journey provides an out-of-classroom learning experience and rigorous curriculum that equips students from all 50 United States and more than 145 countries with the confidence, independence, skills, and global competitiveness required of the next generation of leaders.*

*At* ***GYLC****, you will develop into a true global citizen, acquire in-demand leadership skills, and get the travel experience of a lifetime—all in just 10 days. You will have the opportunity to visit international embassies; participate in Global Issues Workshops, during which leading authorities present various 21st-century challenges impacting our world; and hone the communication, decision-making, and negotiation skills you need to be a 21st-century world leader.*

Now, the tuition is around $3,200, so it's not exactly cheap, and I believe the program doesn't cover transport to and from the campus (plane tickets) and considering I live in Bolivia, a considerable distance from NYC, it might turn out to be too expensive, especially since it's during summer where tickets are usually higher-priced, and because I would probably travel with my parents. George Mason University isn't that good of a college either, as it has a 90% acceptance rate and is ranked around #150 nationally. But if I do decide to go, I'll be going for the unique travel experience, not for the university. Some of my friends who also got invited want to go and say it's worth it, but others say it's a scam, and I kinda agree with both points of view. So I wanted to know your opinions on this, if anyone went to something like this and how did it go, is it worth it, or if you rejected the invitation and why. The due date for enrollment is closing in, and I don't want to miss the opportunity if this is actually worth it. So please, if anyone knows more about this, tell me. Thanks!

70,Consistent-Dare8455,1646846514,/r/college/comments/tacr2t/what_should_i_do/,"I'm looking for some advice on my life because I feel kind of lost. 

I graduated with a bachelor's in history from a university in the Netherlands. I thought I was going to be a history professor. Unfortunately, things didn't really turn out the way I wanted to. I figured out that college professors were more researchers than teachers and I'm more into the teaching aspect. The education system in the Netherlands was also very tough, much tougher than American high school. Because of this, my grades were very low. Most of students over there get Cs. Grade inflation isn't really a thing.

Because of this, going to grad school isn't really an option, unfortunately. My grades are just too low. My biggest priority is to get a job as quickly as possible. However, I also want to think about the future. I have been thinking about a couple of different paths that I could take:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Going back to College and doing another Bachelor's**: This is one of the things that I have taken a look at. I don't want to do this, but if I want to get an MBA or go do graduate work, I will most likely have to do this because I will be accepted into a masters program with my current low grades. The greatest con is that it takes too long and can be quite expensive. 
* **Doing a certificate to get new skills**: This would be my preferred route. It would only take a year and I would be learning applicable skills. However, I probably still wouldn't be accepted to graduate school. 
* **Going to Graduate school**: The main reason I would want to go to graduate school is to level up in my career. I still have a passion for teaching and would definitely see me teaching in my spare time. The only question is how I can get there.

So what do you guys think? Is it worth the cost to get another Bachelor's degree? Or are there other paths I should look into?

71,KindaNotSmart,1646793188,/r/college/comments/t9xhbj/study_tips_productivity_tips_that_everyone_can/,"I bullshitted my way through 70% of school. The last 30% are hard STEM classes that I cannot bullshit my way through. A combination of adderall and discipline allowed me to establish good study &amp; productivity habits that I still employ when I'm not taking adderall. These are numbered but are in no particular order. 

1) Downtime

If you have an iPhone, use the 'Downtime' feature during mornings. It's under 'Screen Time'. Essentially, every single app &amp; website is locked for you during the times that you set. You can set certain apps and websites that are needed, such as email and school portals etc as 'Always Allowed'. When I wake up, I have a bad habit of staying in bed for a while browsing my phone. Setting my downtime from the morning to afternoon allows me to not get caught up on social media, forcing me to get out of bed and get my shit done. 

2) App Restrictions

You don't actually have to follow the restrictions. Under 'Screen Time', see which apps you use the most. Mainly social media apps. Set 1 hour restrictions on these apps daily. You don't actually need to follow these restrictions. Once the app is restricted, you can choose to 'ignore restriction for 15 minutes'. Do this throughout the day as many times as you need. Again, I have a horrible habit of going through social media and not realizing how much time I spend doing it. Throughout the day, basically every time you want to use the app it'll remind you that you've passed the limit, and if you click 'ignore for 15 minutes' then once 15 minutes shoots by, you'll realize it instead of spending an hour on your phone thinking only 5 minutes have passed. I estimate that 90% of you reading this are on Reddit avoiding your other responsibilities. Restrictions will help with this. 

3) Timers

When I'm studying, I usually take constant breaks. Studying has the opposite effect on me as social media; 10 minutes of studying feels like an hour of studying. Setting timers allows you to see how much time you're spending while you're studying. My method is to set a timer. 25 minutes of studying, then a 5-10 minute break depending on how burnt out I am. Time your breaks too. Bathroom breaks count as your breaks, you can't take your 10 minute break then go use the bathroom

4) Libraries/Study Rooms

If you don't like studying in public, you should suck it up and do it anyway. When you're home, you're surrounded by comfort and distractions. If you take the time to leave your house and go to the library, you're committing to study. If you stay home, you can stop anytime you want. 

5) Rewards

I love steak. I eat about 1lb of steak on a daily basis. Every time I go steak shopping, I'll by packs of cheap prime New York Strips, but I'll also get some expensive wagyu steak. I leave it in my freezer, and I'm not allowed to eat it unless I get an A on a test or hard assignment. Overall, I use wagyu steaks as rewards for things, not only for tests/assignments. It's good to reward yourself. 

6) Posture

When I first started developing my study habits, my posture was terrible. I'd lean forward and my head would be facing down for hours. Once I left the library, my body would be stuck leaning forward and the muscles in my frontal upper body were very tight. It was terrible. I practiced sitting up straight, and rather than facing my head down, I'd keep my head straight and face my eyes down. It was hard the first few times, but now I can comfortably stay at the library for 8 hours and not feel like a train wreck afterwards. I'd say posture is one of the most important things on this list. 

7) Exercise

It's a fact that we study better after we've exercised. Exercise also helps with mental health. You don't need to go lift heavy weights for 3 hours. A nice walk, a small run, anything physical before you start studying will help. 

8) NUTRITION AND HYDRATION

If you don't focus on nutrition and hydration, you need to reevaluate the way you see yourself. You are an animal and a machine. Water is the root of all life. Water is our fuel. I see water the same way a car sees gasoline. I NEED IT. I drink 1.5 gallons per day and I always feel great. My ex literally drank 1 tiny cup of water per day and ate 2 tiny meals per day and she never had energy to do anything. WE ARE BEASTS. WE NEED FUEL. WE NEED WATER. WE NEED FOOD. If you take no effort in getting in your protein, calories, and hydration on a daily basis, then don't complain that you don't have energy. Furthermore, STUDYING TAKES ENERGY. I'm a gym rat. I track my calories and my macros, time my meals throughout the day etc. I see my study sessions as workout sessions. Every hour you study is 1 set of brain curls. If you're not properly feeding yourself, you aren't going to study well, same way with working out. On days where I know I'll be at the library for a while, I will fill a medium sized water bottle full of fat free milk (Fat free has no cholesterol) and take it with me, along with protein bars, protein shakes, and gallon water bottles. The natural sugars in milk are fine for you even if you're cutting. Brain power uses up carbs, so a nice cup of milk or orange juice while studying can help replenish you. 

9) Sleep

This one is obvious, and I'm sure everyone has read tips saying get more sleep. Time is precious. When you are dead tired while you're studying, your brain is less engaged, it takes you much more time to process information, and you retain much less information. If it's the day before the exam, alright understandable to stay up late cramming. But on the days leading up to the exam, make sure you're getting your sleep or else you aren't retaining any of that information. 

Get some melatonin, it's an OTC drug that is naturally found in our bodies and is responsible for sleep. As a matter of fact, melatonin production increases when it's dark. So if you're staying in a lit up room with screens on full brightness, you aren't going to get sleep. Make sure your room is as dark as possible and turn down phone brightness. 

10) Fashion over comfort (situational)

This one might be weird to some. It's situational depending on your personality. Personally, I feel happy and confident when I'm well dressed.  Even when I go to the grocery store, I like dressing up. My mood can be swayed by how I'm dressed. If I dress like a celebrity and go to the library, I'm more likely to be happy and stay longer because I enjoy being dressed up. If I dress up in my hobo clothes to be comfortable since I know I'm staying a while, maybe I'll be physically comfort, but my mood will be lazy and tired since my comfort clothes are my lazy and tired clothes. Again, this is situational. If you are happiest in a hoodie and sweats, then by all means go with that. 

11) Classical Music

I normally hate classical music, but you aren't going to retain information well if you listen to songs that you know the beats/lyrics to. When songs I know/like are playing, my brain is subconsciously following along with the beat since I know the beat. You want your entire focus to be on studying. On Spotify, some things I search up while studying include ""calm piano"" ""calming classical"" ""lofi study"". Find whatever works for you. The beats can't be catchy. It has to be background music. Classical music is also known to help with focus. Tie this idea back to number 3: Timing. Listen to classical music the 25 minutes that you're studying, then play your favorite songs during your break.

12) HEADPHONE VOLUME

I'm not sure what is shown for other headphones, but on iPhone with AirPods, you can control the dB of your audio. Basically, even if your volume is turned down, there are certain sounds within music that can exceed safe dB levels. When studying, your goal is to have background music but be focused on studying. You don't want to damage your hearing for background music. Most of our headphones are automatically set to the highest decibel level, which Is 100 decibels and is as loud as an ambulance siren in your ear. The lowest decibel option is 75, which is as loud as a vacuum cleaner. If you're like me and you're used to absolutely destroying your ears, it'll take you a bit to get used to these lower levels. But like I said, since you're listening to background classical music, it doesn't really matter. Feel free to turn the dB back up during your breaks when listening to songs you like. Sounds - Headphone Safety is where you can find this feature. If you set the slider all the way to the bottom, you can max out your headphone volume safely. 

13) STRETCH

Even with good posture, when typing/taking notes, your body will have a natural tendency to lean forward, resulting in tightening of your chest and frontal shoulder muscles. During your breaks, go to the bathroom and get in a nice stretch. Get some paper, lay it on your flat out hand, and put your hand against a wall with a straight arm and tilt your body/chest away to get a nice stretch in your chest. Stretching is very important and it replenishes you. 

14) ROUTINE

Any other fellow gym rats know that gym isn't an ""option"" in your day. My days are planned around my workouts and any other duties I have. I'm never like ""eh I won't do it today"" because it's part of my routine. You need to make studying this way as well. It's good to plan out what times you will study. My mornings and early afternoons are for school and work. My mid afternoons are for gym. Once it's around 4-6PM, I'm already done with my workout, almost done with my daily caloric intake, already showered, and my only other obligations are to go study. Then I'll go to the library, bring drinks and snacks, and stay there until 11 - 12.

I moved out of my hometown to go to school and take seriously my studies and work hard towards a degree, and now it seems like I am focusing more on having to pay my bills to live in this city, instead of being able to focus on school. 

My rent is so expensive, I work 2 jobs- one full time and then I had to pick up another part time job to help towards bills. I usually have 12-14 days now each week and I have no choice. 

My mental health has been awful and I just can’t mentally handle school right now. I’m trying to not give up but it’s so hard. I have absolutely no will or motivation to do my school work, I absolutely dread it, and I have no care for any of it right now. The days that I do have off, I just can’t seem do my work because I’m so exhausted all I want to do is lay on my couch all day. 

I was thinking of dropping another class with a higher work load, in hopes that will make the rest of my work load easier and less stressful. Are you able to drop classes or withdraw, after a month of the semester? I do not want to give up, but I don’t know what to do because I feel like I can’t do school right now. 

I’m in therapy for OCD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and my therapist said she would be more than happy to write a letter if need be for supported reasons of having to drop a class due to my mental state. 

I just can’t do it right now. I was so happy to be in school and now I just have no will for it. I think I just decided to take on too much and with work it’s just stressing me out and exhausting. 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

I live in Michigan if that is needed to know if there’s a difference of withdrawing rules per each state.

My parents have established that I can pay for my state school (Rutgers) and I could go there, but any other school outside of the state would be too expensive. Even though Rutgers is a good school, as dumb as this sounds, I really don't want to go there. It has a bad rep at my school and its purely an ego thing for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently enrolled in a CSU and absolutely hate it. I met nobody I call ""friends"" on campus and had to switch dorm rooms TWICE due to roommate and housing issues. I had one in person class last semester and have only one online and the rest in person this semester, but in person classes are delayed until mid February and I am absolutely dreading going back to live on campus. Two out of the six classes I'm enrolled in are either going to be dropped or swapped as the professors are asking WAY too much from the students (I fucked up by not reading the ratemyprofessor reviews) and or requiring extremely expensive course materials that can only be purchased through the professor. Another class I'm enrolled in was supposed to be an in-person class but changed to an asynchronous class the day before the semester began. I am extremely disappointed in my class picks and was already wanting to switch schools but this solidified my thinking even more. 

I understand that there is a required 60 units or about two years worth of 15 units in classes per semester required to switch from one college in California to another, but if you are going from one CSU to another is it any different? Even if it's the same situation I will most likely end up at a community college until I am eligible to return to a normal school.

85,Woat_The_Drain,1639269885,/r/college/comments/red0eu/american_colleges_are_a_scam_even_for_stem/,"**TL;DR: American colleges prioritize anything else over teaching and do not run a tight ship.** 

**WARNING:** All the examples I give are from the university I went to, but I went to a highly acclaimed American school and I know many people who got a lot less from other ""better"" schools who paid a lot more than I did. It also goes without saying that all of these examples are much worse at most American ""party"" schools where they prioritize teaching and career prep even less, and I know a lot of people who went to these types of schools.

**I know what you're thinking: ""This is some kid who didn't do well and didn't find a job so he is blaming his problems on something else."" Actually, this is further from the truth.** 

**I graduated with an engineering degree with a high GPA and I easily got a good job in my field after graduation. I am satisfied with my life at this point.** I definitely learned a lot in college, but I can't help think that I could have learned a lot of this on my own without spending 10s of thousands of dollars or at least what I got out of college was not worth the price. Even with an academic scholarship for 50% off tuition, I still paid a ton of money. I was really funny to see that athletes got priority in an institution that was supposed to be about learning. I actually almost became a starter on one of our best varsity teams since I was recruited, but I figured it would be a waste of time since I don't want to spend 4 years playing sports instead of learning. Athletes had the same scholarship I did, but with a 0.5 point lower GPA requirement and with preferential treatment in course scheduling. I get that athletes need to get priority to schedule things around practices and games, but this just proves that American colleges prioritize sports over actual learning.

I used to be a college advocate because people in my industry frequently told me that they prefer college graduates over self-taught people because in college you learn the meaning behind all the principles that you are taught and you could therefore be creative and extrapolate them to engineering new things. Despite this argument, I kept noticing that all I need from college are these key explanations, and professional instruction, which is what I got, but I still think the price I got them for is a rip-off. Some of the best professors I ever had agreed with me. In class they would say ""Tuition is ridiculously expensive and the price that you guys pay per hour to be here is unjustified so it's in your best interest to pay attention.""

I think that this is caused by colleges falling prey to chasing profits. **There is nothing wrong with chasing profits since it is a great incentive structure to make your product better, unless it causes your product to get worse...**

American colleges nowadays prioritize selling ""The College Experience"" over learning and being tough. They love to raise tuition so that they can pour millions into sports facilities, professors' research that sometimes isn't very useful, and random events that totally overpower the actual objective of being there: actually learning. I loved the ""College Experience."" Partying and having fun with friends and going to events and being able to discipline myself as an adolescent to get my life together was great...but I can do all of that without paying tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately this has created a perverse incentive structure where student ""happiness"" is prioritized over learning. Colleges will get more student satisfaction and good reviews if they make their classes easy, super informal, and have the professors bow down to the students. American adolescents love this type of stuff since they are immature and have been sold this type of lifestyle. And I don't blame them. Why would you go to a school with hard classes and strict professors, when you can get the same degree from a school with a similar ranking/reputation with easy classes and pushover professors?

I went to a pretty good engineering school, but I would not send my future children there. At least, I would not give the school any of my money. There was so much blatant cheating, professors that changed grading schemes and gave extreme curves because we were so lazy, and students would show up to class late and in pajamas just to play on their phone the whole time while their parents were paying dozens of their hard earned dollars per hour for their kids to be there. 

So many of my classes were easy A's because the professors were basically afraid of upsetting the students. And I remember so many classmates prioritizing taking a ton of easy freshman-level classes as electives over actually practical ones just so that they could get their degree with no effort. I despised this. I thought ""You were blessed enough to be born in the U.S. into a middle-upper class family and have your parents pay for your degree and you have the audacity to sign up to learn nothing in these easy classes just so you can get the participation award."" Each year we had a credit limit of 20 per semester and any credit amount over 12 credits was just charged as a one-time ""Full Time"" tuition, so someone taking 12 credits would pay the same as someone taking 20 credits. I made it a point to take 18-20 credits EVERY SEMESTER of my college years, except my last semester when I took 16 credits of Graduate-Level courses and focused on my job search. I was paying them money and I was going to get my money's work

Not all bad classes had bad professors. Many of my professors were geniuses who had a lot of good stuff to say, but they were not held accountable for their class not being worth the money. I thought it was disgusting that these smart men and women had the worst organization skills that I have ever seen. We used the ""Canvas"" software that most schools use and these professors had no clue how to use it. They would also forget to upload essential material that they said they would, spent the entire semester grading assignments that were due in the first week of class, changed the rules of the course as they went, and were disorganized in general. I had a professor who never used slides or prepared material. This was a highly technical, mathematical, and logical class. He just had a list of topics to cover per lecture and he would actively write out the lesson as he went. His verbal explanations were better than any supplemental material and he taught us deep explanations as to why these mathematical structures operated as they did. The problem was that he wrote everything in a Google Doc in Arial font, including diagrams written on the fly in Google Drawings with a laptop trackpad . Thus, looking back on the notes was effectively useless. He also made new rules on the fly like ""pop quiz every week to encourage you guys to study"" that only happened twice before he forgot about it. He also barely wrote essential planning info down like test dates or test info. Now, you may think: ""OP, you are complaining about college being too easy, but get mad when the prof doesn't spoon feed you the info."" I'm not mad that he didn't spoon feed the info and wrote everything during class, like how college used to be (which is cool). I am mad about his lack or organization and me spending much of my time dedicated to that class trying to guess what would happen next. I learned a lot of essential info from the two classes that I took with that professor, but they could have been perfect if his organizational skills weren't abysmal. He did have two very smart TAs but they were effectively useless. Why you may ask? Because we barely got homework. We got 4 very large homework assignments throughout the whole semester even though he promised 12+. This sounds like a simple class structure difference, but most college students don't learn well like that. The best classes had mandatory small and frequent assignments that led up to the large projects so that we would get constant practice and have a reason to got to the TAs for more info and help. But, when you make the homework assignment very infrequent (or make homework optional, as other classes did), you create an incentive structure where students will prioritize homework from other classes over your own. **Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with students being held accountable for motivating themselves to study often and put in work, but if you are charging obscene amounts of money you cannot ignore the basic psychological fact that adolescents are more likely to learn if you give them mandatory constant practice that is, each time, a little harder than their current abilities.**

I did have a few great classes with great professors. ALL of my favorite classes involved the professor coming in on the first day and saying something along the lines of: **""If you are not here to learn, get out so you don't disrupt my lecture. I know a lot more about the world than you do so do not even try the BS that most college students do when they refuse to do work or beg for better grades. I don't care what grade you get and if you fail, you fail, but I just care that you learn a lot.""** I would pay good money to have my future children to take these classes. The professors cared and were not afraid to subordinate students' happiness to actually learning. They taught practical skills and were very aware that college was a rip off. 

**How to make College Classes Worth the Money:**

1. **Make sure the info is relevant and taught well.**
2. **Have constant practice with progressive overload via assignments and quizzes as well as frequent professor attention.**
3. **Hold the professor accountable for not doing his/her job or being too disorganized**.
4. **MAKE ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTENDANCE MANDATORY.** (It makes me sick to my stomach when a class has optional attendance and homework because only and idiot would believe that a bunch of 18-22 year-olds would prioritize that work over anything else).
5. **Cut the inflated salaries of college administrators and PRIORITIZE learning from industry and research professionals over having fun for 4-5 years.** (We would get emails every day about what cool fun events are happening on campus, but barely any on essential info to get jobs and known paths to success via hard work. I don't care about the new $10 million rec center full of random things that the school just built. I am here to learn and set myself up for a great career.)
6. **Don't let students run the show.** Teenagers and young adults are notoriously bad at discipline and everyone on Earth knows that college-aged young adults make impulsive and self-gratifying decisions while thinking about the short term. With this, you will greatly increase the chances of success of students.
7. **If you are a student, think about whether you need to go to college right now.** Maybe it isn't the best idea to get a degree in philosophy right out of high school just to have fun and blame everyone except yourself when you aren't a millionaire in 4 years. Set yourself up financially by getting a more practical degree or entering the job force and ensure stability. **Once you are stable and happy with your life, go back and get that philosophy degree** so you can put in your effort since you're more mature and don't worry about becoming poor. **If you are passionate about the ""less practical"" or non-STEM subjects, they are totally worth studying in a professional context...just not right out of high school by someone who knows nothing about the world and has no stability in his/her life.**

My favorite class in college was a class outside of my major but it had an excellent professor, practical info, and great structure. The professor did not have the most advanced degrees like other professors did, but he DAMN well knew how to run a class. We had lectures during the week where he would present like a professional public speaker and teach us only the most relevant information. Then we would have assignments each week based on that week's lecture that were slightly more advanced than our current abilities so we were challenged, but in a way that made us want to struggle and put in effort. The content of each assignment was always very relevant and I maintain those skills to this day. He came in on Day 1 and laid out the grading scheme and said that if anyone disagreed or thinks they can manipulate him instead of putting in the work, they can walk out right then and there. He kept his promise. I failed several assignments because they were hard, but I DIDN'T care. I learned a ton of info from the class and he made it clear that the assignments were challenging and that since we had a week to do them and TAs as a resource, all grades were final. I almost forgot to mention the TAs. The only people he allowed to be TAs were former students who previously earned a 95+% in his course and he treated them very well, so they were incentivized to do a great job. **This man earned my money and my respect.**

It was really sad to see that the students that got high-paying jobs at FAANG (now MAANG) companies or high-level engineering positions had GPAs in the low 2.0 range. They had initiative, drive, skills, and the ability to delay self-gratification. **They were only there to get the degree since most high-level jobs required one.** **This racket made them spend tens of thousands of dollars for no reason.** I also knew a lot of them and they were extremely smart. Not academic smart or ""book smart,"" but their problem solving skills and logical abilities were insane. They easily could have gotten 4.0s, but why waste their time, when they could learn a lot more on their own? These people easily had 140+ IQs and they all tried to get high-level jobs that didn't require a degree out of high school and they worked their asses off outside of school.

Most of the high-level skills that got me a good job were self-taught. :(

I really hope that there is some sort of shift from high-level jobs requiring degrees. Once that happens, colleges will be forced to make students get their money's worth in learning and the people that truly deserve those jobs will be motivated to get their money's worth or not to go to college at all. The modern American college system is a racket and they are not even hiding it.

**I, however, am hopeful. I go on job recruiting websites and see the GPA requirements getting lower and lower or even with a degree being optional. GOOD JOB. Hire people based purely on their skills and abilities, and not whether or not they spent a bunch of money to get a fancy title next to their name.**",college,"American Colleges are a Scam, even for STEM Degrees.

My boyfriend goes to an expensive private college. He was a mechanical engineering major and recently switched to aerospace. I’m a senior and he’s a junior.

The content still looks very difficult. It looks like a foreign language. I’m so proud of him and how smart he is. I can’t wait to see what his future holds and hope I can be a part of it too. That being said, I’m totally jealous of his natural talent! 

I’m an allied health science major. I struggled through anatomy and physiology, organic chem, and microbiology because it was a lot of info at once. I’m not great at studying and lack time management. I still was able to pull A’s in a&amp;p and orgo I. Microbiology was rough and the professor was actually let go last semester for repeated complaints from students. Just a little bit of information so you guys can understand why I’m asking. 

I’m definitely envious of his ability to ace everything. How does he do it? I thought engineering was supposed to be one of the hardest majors. My engineering friends at my school study a lot for exams and still fail. He definitely has a natural talent, but how on earth do you get an A on a thermodynamic exam you’ve never studied for?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, I’m a 19yo male who needs help deciding his major.

First of all, you should know that last year I was at my first year of college studying CS and I hated it ( I’m not really the typical CS guy, I love going out, partying and doing sports, since I didn’t get along with my colleagues since they didn’t have the same hobbies/ interests as mine and I was mostly alone while being stuck at home during weekdays because of classes and weekends due to regulations, I ended up getting depressed and I didn’t have any joy in attending classes which resulted in me failing some and having no desire of continuing).

Fast forward to September this year I have to choose a new degree( still a bit depressed at this point but not as much), I opt for industrial engineering but I didn’t get in, which ended in me studying CS again but this time at a better qualified college( best in my country) and currently I am liking it but I’m not loving it like I think you should love your degree, it’s alright.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I’ll tell you about my interests and possible majors/careers.

&amp;#x200B;

1st option - Majoring In CS 

Negative -

probably not enjoying college that much and probably the job too, I don’t really like the ideia of staying behind a screen in pjs all day every day. 

Positive - Having a salary that will qualify me as ‘rich’ in my country’s standards in a few years, living a wealthier lifestyle than my acquaintances, have a flexible work schedule and having the possibility of working abroad (e.g. the US).

P.S this was my first choice mostly due to the salary and due to always being influenced to be a engineer even though I have never had that love to build things and etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd Option - Double Minor In Business and Law 

Negative - This degree is only available at a private school which will make tuition 7x more expensive, never been a fan of reading and interpreting text in high school which could make law very hard and this would be my third time entering college, so will only finish it when I’m 25.

Positive - Even though I never had the entrepreneurial mind set of creating products like most business major attendees, I always enjoyed finding optimal ways to make things faster, cheaper, better, etc ( hence why I had chosen industrial engineering) and marketing, dealing with problems that come with running a business, basically everything about running a business except creating the product and law because I love people and mostly helping people, if it was for me I would be friends with everyone and I always saw lawyer as a good and respected job where people always dress very classy which is something I would like to do latter in life( I know you don’t need to be a lawyer to dress classy, but you don’t see mechanics pulling up in suits because it just isn’t appropriate).

&amp;#x200B;

3rd and Last - Pilot

Negatives - Going to the air force and living in a military base away from home and friends for a minimum of 10 years OR paying a lot more money than I can afford to go to private flight school. ( 5 years of college here is about 5 minimum wages in public college whilst 2 years of this private college is about 100 minimum wages) and again wasting 2 years of my life. Not having a schedule and not spending time with family and friends. Salary could be very low or very high, it all depends which job I land and job availability is not really a certitude.

Positives - This was my childhood dream, I don’t really miss people as cold hearted as this could sound it’s the truth, and I always thought about traveling the world and learning about different languages and cultures. 

I know no one will decide for me but give your take on the subject.

P.S a friend of mine suggested doing CS and then getting a pilot course with the money I’ve earned which is not a bad ideia but will be done at around 30yo

It’s a pretty expensive school, but I got a scholarship so i only pay room &amp; board, and do a 10 week summer research program. I love the city here and the campus and I’ve made a good group of friends, and have great grades. But I’m so miserable. I’m depressed and am losing motivation. I’ve been here for two months and I just want to be home. My favorite memories of the past two months are either when I visited home or when my parents visited me. My mom is my best friend and the only person I feel like myself around, and doesn’t completely drain me. I feel so alone here, even though I have friends. I love living away from home, but I just want the comfort of knowing I can see my family without planning a four hour trip weeks in advance. I am also struggling with a bit of an eating disorder relapse. I am considering transferring to a college 15 minutes from home, where the cost will be just a little higher than my cost with full tuition scholarship here. I would still live in the dorms, but be able to go out with my family when I need it. I’m in one of the worst places mentally, and it hasn’t gotten better like everyone said it would after the first month. I spent today holding back tears in every class because I wanted to be comfortable. This feels like too much at once. I would be supported by my family is I transferred, but I feel like I’d be letting everyone down by doing so.

You can ask professors to sit in on a class for free space permitting but many professors won’t allow it and say you have to go through the formal auditing process. 

It’s frustrating. I mean college is way too expensive for even new students without degrees but continuing education is extremely expensive. You’re not getting a degree or any class credit so why does it have to be full price? And even alums can’t get discounts on tuition after we took out $$$ in loans to pay you for a degree program?

Seems like the obvious choice is to move out, however like I said, we aren’t that wealthy and I can’t really afford to live there, I would most likely need some additional loans. I find it difficult enough to successfully study for Mech. engineering without a job at home, and I would NEED one to be able to live there. However I would save so much living at home.

So I've been very interested in this topic for a long time, I'm always reading stuff on politics, climate, sociology, anthropology and stuff like this, so I thought uni would be great for me, but as it turns out, I'm just not really enjoying it at all... Several times I feel like some classes are a waste of time for being either too superficial (the amount of content we need to study is so large there is no time to actually go deeper into topics), having a boring subject or the worst, when the subject is supposed to be super cool like Anthropology but the professor just sucks. All in all I don't feel like I'm learning a lot from it. Besides, I'm struggling to keep up with the amount of assignments and reading required, especially for subjects I don't give a shit about and find extremely boring (like law and maths).

I wonder what's wrong with me as my colleagues seems to be doing somewhat fine, I don't know, I always hated school and I generally don't do well with hierarchical authority, but I love studying.

110,KineticPutty,1630706975,/r/college/comments/phf00w/im_almost_21_and_i_still_dont_know_what_career_i/,"Right after I graduated High school, I had no idea of what I wanted to do. I had, and still have, too many interests and fascinations, and I was unable to confidently choose a career that I would be willing to spend thousands of dollars of tuition on. In order to step my toes into the water, I went with a much cheaper option: community college

In my state, you are given a free year of community college, and you can be given several more if you get good grades. It felt stupid not to pick this path. After all, most degrees and careers require some generic general ed classes, and it would be advantageous to get the credits from community college rather than an expensive four year university

My first semester went extremely well and I never felt felt more attentive and engaged in my education. My second semester was satisfying as well, at least up until COVID-19 closed down the campus

I, not wanting to waste those free years, had to endure 2.5 semesters of online college and to say it’s been tough is a disgusting understatement. I barely feel like I’ve learned anything since then. My assignments felt more like an endless series of monotonous tasks that relied on me to briefly learn some information that I would immediately afterwards. There was no human contact or academic environment to put me in my “learning mode”, and my ADHD gnawed away at my attention to school.

I initially planned to use my second year of community college to take a variety of classes that would give me hands-on experience in the interests I have. I wanted to take physics, engineering, chemistry, mechatronics, etc. Obviously, Covid19 made this impossible.

I’m on now on my fifth semester and this is the first semester we have been allowed back on campus since March 2020. In the fashion of a greek tragedy, this is likely going to be my last year at this college since my family is planning on moving across states and I’m extremely dependent on my family. 

—————————————————

Because of the difficulties that online classes have on me, I have yet to take any chemistry, physics, and calculus class outside of calculus 1

As of now, my interests are: Biology, Robotics, Aerospace engineering, and 3D modeling. I love 3D modeling, but I sincerely doubt I could make a career solely based on that alone. I’ve also noticed that I have a strong desire to know how things work; I got so caught up in trying to learn how a 555 timer chip works that I spent the whole day on a circuit simulator.

I got waitlisted to Pepperdine originally (sadly not offered a spot), and I can apply for spring or fall 2022 for free. I'm attending another small, private, liberal-arts, religious college for either the fall semester or the entire year. I kind of really want to go to Pepperdine as soon as possible but I'm not sure if this is the best idea...

I got an F in AP Statistics my last trimester in HS. Before that my lowest grade is I think a 79 in gym. My third lowest grade is maybe an 87 ... pre-pandemic. I was not comfortable working out on my Zoom camera in front of the whole class so I kept getting 0s for gym ... and AP Statistics my teacher had us doing all of our math assignments on something similar to Khan Academy. I would continuously get the right answer but type it in a different format (i.e decimal when they wanted percent) and it would mark it wrong. I would spend HOURS and HOURS crying at my laptop trying to get 80s or 100s and doing math on my computer just doesn't work for me at all. My last trimester I was so burnt out and stressed and we were cramming so hard for the AP test I couldn't bring myself to do the online work anymore. We would do so many FRQs, open responses, and overall work and take notes in class but she didn't put any of those in as grades. Only the online stuff. 

At the time I was going through a break up and my dog became extremely ill and my dad told me I was completely on my own for college. I had so much stress at the time my hair was falling out and I lost over 20 pounds which led me to being underweight. I know I should've just done the work, but I FINALLY got to go back to school full-time and I was so done with online work I accepted the bad grade. I already knew where I was going, I knew it wouldn't affect anything so I saved myself the added on stress. So ... I got a 65. I accepted that. If I could go back I would.

If I apply to transfer in spring they will look at my high school transcript. I cannot afford this school without the 30k scholarship. Even with aid it will be too expensive. I am going to work my ass off and hopefully get a 4.0 this semester. Nothing below a 3.8 is acceptable. I didn't take the SAT or ACT and Pepperdine's test optional, but I was hoping if I took it and got a high score this + my high GPA will help mask my two low grades.

I have work experience, a good rec letter, and I have a good amount of extracurriculars from HS. I plan on joining clubs at my school too. They have a chapel, and I plan on practicing faith (it's something I've always wanted to do but never had access to a church). 

Do you think if I pull off the high GPA and high SAT/ACT score I should apply for the spring semester? This has been my dream school for so long I can't believe I let it slip through my fingers from the stupid AP Statistics class.

I am going into my second year of college and I've been feeling extremely left out lately watching my friends and random students on tiktok move into their dorms and start a new chapter. I don't start until September because I'm on the quarter system but I live ""local"" to my school (it's about a 40 minute commute one way) so I was denied housing since they prioritized students who live farther, which makes sense. 

I already didn't get the ""traditional"" freshmen experience last year because of COVID and online school and now it feels like I'm losing my whole college experience because I have to commute. I keep getting more and more disappointed as school gets closer because I have dreamed about moving into a dorm and going off to college for SO long but feel like it's getting ripped away, just like last year when they said the school year was going to be online.

At the time this college seemed like the perfect fit (great programs for my double major, close to home but not too close, good financial aid, safe area, etc) but now I just feel like choosing a ""close"" school is coming back to haunt me. I had always planned to go to a school far away (my dream school was out of state but too expensive even after financial aid) but that's just not how it ended up going. I really love the school I chose and the friends I've made (even though everything has been online) but in the back of my mind part of me considers at least applying to schools to transfer to just so I can have the slightest possibility to live on campus and experience the college life I've always wanted since I may never get it here. 

I was so on top of everything when it came to housing (I applied quite literally the second the housing applications opened) but in the end I still lost out. All of my roommates got housing except for me. I know kids who applied literal months after the deadline and still got housing and it honestly is really upsetting. 

I know some people think that this experience is overrated but it just feels like an experience I'll never be able to get back, especially since I am graduating a year early. I was even prepared to go off campus but they told us about the housing shortage so late that all the surrounding off campus apartments were already filled up by upperclassmen who never planned on living on campus in the first place. I'm gonna try my best to be as involved in campus life as possible and make friends through classes but it probably just won't be the same.

This fall is his last semester and I'm stoked because I hate dealing with college.

&amp;#x200B;

When I graduated, I never wanted to think about a lecture, think about the fafsa, or think about anything college related. Even though I went to school for seven years, I only received one undergrad because it was a long, painful process... and expensive. I never want to think about having to coordinate time off with the academic calendar or worry about a project due on Monday and the group wants to meet Sunday night at 8 pm. Thinking back, I would leave for class, go to work and come home. I wouldn't talk about unfair professors, I wouldn't talk about long assignments. I wouldn't talk about how I was flunking two classes that I managed to pull Bs out of both of them.

I am happy that he is getting post secondary school but I'm sick of hearing about it. I'm sick of hearing how he has to fill out the fafsa, how he had to talk to his professors about missing class, about how the group doesn't want to meet until the day before the project is due. I get it; it's stressful! I did it! I lived in a constant state of panic while going; I just didn't talk about it. He, on the other hand, is very vocal about what is going on at school and he is involving me in the entire process. When he has to miss class, he asked me what he should do. When the group doesn't want to meet, he does the entire project and asks me for feedback. He is annoyed with unfair professors and their class structure. The list can go on, but it won't.

119,CJ64Bit,1628641905,/r/college/comments/p2228x/honest_advice_from_a_recent_college_graduate_and/,"•if you can commute and/or live at home (assuming you have a healthy home life to do so) then live at home. Living in the dorms is expensive and unless you are fortunate enough to have all of it paid off and it’s no problem then save those thousands on thousand of dollars and live at home, it sucks and you’re not going to get the “college experience” but you can still visit friends on campus and go out with them. Privacy and freedom will come later, I promise. 

•Look for on campus jobs if you need money. Most schools offer on campus positions of all types from IT to tutoring to manual labor to even being an RA which can offer you benefits and tuition deductions, ask around and see what fits you. 

•You’re not the main character, the dorms don’t belong to you. No matter how adult you think you are, no matter what you believe is in your rights, understand that the residence halls on your college campus have rules and they do apply to you. Don’t be a nuisance to the staff or your peers just because you believe it’s your right to go and scream to your hearts content or whatever it may be. Be respectful to those around you and those of us who don’t get paid enough to deal with you. 

• Don’t bring too much but don’t skimp on bringing things for later seasons. You may not need a winter coat now but you will in a few months and honestly it’s better to have things you’ll need later than to worry about getting them later. Remember that whatever you move has to be moved out and that can be a lot of work. Save yourself the hassle and pack relatively light. 

• Change your major. If you’re not happy with what you’re doing, change your major, it’s never too late. It may set you back, it may be hard to explain, but it does you no good to continue on with some major you have lost passion for. It’s okay to switch majors and studies show that 1 in 5 college students change their major at some point in their lives. Before you do, take the time to understand how much it may set you back and what other fees may come with this change in major as well as if any grants or scholarships are major/field specific.

•Drop out if you feel you need to. This is advice that many people will likely throw their nose up at me and tell me how wrong and irresponsible this is but...if college isn’t for you, if you’re going to fail out, if the education you need can be received through a training program elsewhere, whatever it may be, dropping out is a valid option. The course load for many majors is tough and you need to pull through and get your work done in order to succeed but for many, college just isn’t for them and that doesn’t make these people failures or anything of the sort. Don’t let someone persuade you into continuing with college if it is going to just put you in a hole of debt that is doing you no good to begin with. 

•Go to the campus events. Not all of them will be your thing and I’m not saying go to all of them but you’d be surprised who you may meet there or the fun you may have. They may seem cheesy, and likely some of them will be, but if you have a passing interest just go and see what’s there. 

•Utilize student health services while you’re a student. On campus student health facilities can provide a lot of testing youre going to pay for elsewhere, many on campus clinics (this differs per school) offer STD/UTI testing, strep testing, and can provide basic medicine, checkups, and even basic consultation. This shit is expensive out in the real world, get it free while you can. 

• Don’t join a frat or sorority if you can’t handle it. People love to party. People want to find friends. People want to feel apart of something and frats or sororities are a great place to do all of these things but you are a student first and a Greek life member second. If you are not responsible enough to balance you Greek life and your student life, then very quickly both of those can be ended at the same time if you get kicked off campus for your grades dropping. 

•Respect your RAs. We don’t want to be cops, most of us don’t anyways. We know you’re college kids just like us and we want you to not feel like you’re under constantly monitoring but if you really want every single infraction you do to be reported we can especially if you’re an asshole towards us. Why should we respect you if you don’t respect us. Trust me, it’s obvious when you’re high. We know when you’re drinking in your room. We know when you’re sneaking people in. We have seen it a million times and you’re not the one sneaky one to get it past us and if you really want us not to care than treat us with basic respect and we will let so much go by, we don’t want to write the report. 

•Don’t room with your friends. It may seem like a good idea but you don’t realize how quickly someone’s living habits can annoy you. It’s better to keep hating someone you already don’t like than it is to hate someone you were once friends with. I’ve seen so many people end up hating their friends or moving out of a room situation with their friends because they realized it was a bad idea. This isn’t the case for every pair or grouping of friends so you could be different but I just wouldn’t risk it. 

•DO NOT buy books before you absolutely know if you need them. So many courses “require” textbooks but never use them and often times you can’t return brand new books for full price, especially if they come with an online code. Feel the class out for a week or two or talk to others who have taken the class, save your money where you can. 

•Know your attendance policies per class. Listen, you’re paying for this education and if you don’t want to show up for Mrs.Simmons 8am English class and she doesn’t care, then don’t but know that you need to make up for what you missed. Know when your tests are. Know what the important grades are. It will not kill you to miss class but be prepared to know what you need to accomplish on your own. You don’t need to worry about being the perfect student unless the class/professor is enforcing that sort of behavior. If you want to attend for your own personal reasons and to get the most out of that tuition cost, that’s also totally okay but recognize when you need to take a mental health day or when you just need time off. 

•Befriend professors, especially those you’ll have for multiple classes, they will help you out with so much and are such a good resource of knowledge and recommendations down the road or maybe even a genuine friendship once you’ve graduated. Having a good relationship with your professors means that you come to mind on recommendations for student positions, interviews, awards, or even possible work opportunities. They want to see you succeed and you’ll thank them for all they’ve done for you if you take the time to become close to you. 

• Know what services are available to students. My campus had a work center that loaned out suits and dresses for interviews and even had student works who were there to practice in mock interviews. We had study rooms you could reserve so you had a quiet place for you and/or your friends to study. We had a print shop where you could print out anything you wanted for a small price up to like 6ft tall by however long. Each college campus has a lot of services you probably don’t know about that can come in handy under the right circumstances. 

• If you get in trouble, own up to it, and take your punishment in stride. Every school is much harder on people who lie and deny when they’ve clearly done something wrong. Punishment can go from a slap on the wrist and a stern talking to, to meeting about your removal from a certain dorm or maybe even the campus real quick. You’re an adult, take responsibility for your actions. If you show those in charge of you that you’re not capable of acting like an adult, you’re more closely observed and are going to be treated more harshly. Whatever your punishment is, do it or respect it, because failure to do either will escalate whatever you were served to something more severe. 

• Know your campus’s policies regarding your rights as a student. Don’t let campus police, the RAs, or the various offices give you false information. There will be people who will lie to you to make their job easier or to try and frame you in a negative light. Understand your rights as a student, even if you have to find loopholes and force technicalities, definitively knowing campus policies can and will save your ass.

• If you don’t want to/can’t go home for the holidays or breaks. Talk to your housing office about staying. Many campuses allow for students with special circumstances to stay if it beneficial to their overall well being or even if you need to stay for work.",college,Honest Advice from a Recent College Graduate and 3 Year RA,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/p2228x/honest_advice_from_a_recent_college_graduate_and/,1628659905.0

I used to have very good grades (straight A’s) in high school before my depression really took a hold of me in high school. But still I managed to graduate with 3.97 unweighted GPA (4.3 something weighted) and passed all my IB exams and got the IB diploma.

But none of this means that I’m actually that smart. I’m no genius. I’d call myself only marginally above average intelligence. My past grades where the accumulation of lots of hard work, time, effort, zero social life, and most importantly, having immigrant Asian parents. 

I may be able to get my old scholarship back but for that I need to maintain stellar grades for the upcoming academic year. And not to mention university is way more expensive than community college. And it’s too late to go for my college scholarships at this point. Not to mention my I probably wouldn’t win any. My GPA isn’t that bad per say, it’s a 3.75 but I’ve been out of school since February 2019, with only part-time jobs and volunteering for habitat for humanity a few times to show for the gap year. If things had gone as planned, I would have graduated with my bachelors of comp sci in May of this year. If anyone has any advice on how to search for, find, and actually win scholarships, please tell me.

I can’t live a home because my parents are emotionally and psychologically abusive, a big reason I had such major depression to begin with. They are also very strict Muslims so they put major restrictions on my life, from how I dress, to who I can be friends with, to where I go, etc. I cannot live with them, I just can’t. I know I would fail within the first 2wks of classes and just lie under covers in my bed day, hugging myself.

Thus, everything goes back to money, as all things always do. Back to original question, do you think it’s possible for me to maintain straight A’s in upper level math and science classes like calc and physics, that I’m not naturally good at, while working 20-25hrs part-time and be a member of 1-2 clubs? I would really appreciate your and advice, especially if anyone has been in a somewhat similar situation. If anyone is still here following along my tirade and read this massive post all the way to the end, thank you so much!

I'm a bit too late applying for on-campus housing, since the refund date passed, so I'm aiming for next spring semester, but until then, I need other options with less than 1 month until school starts. I'm also a poor college student and have no car so there's that too. I'm also a bit late finding off campus apartments near my university, since most are already full or there are normal apartments that are way too expensive for the average college student anyways, but hopefully if I call everyday maybe a unit near my university will open up with very wishful thinking. I tried looking on my various university's housing Facebook groups as well, but most are taken or full of scammer comments so no luck there either. My last resort is just commuting via being driven in my 1 and only old family car for 1 hour, dropped off at the bus stop by my parent to travel another 2 hours, and then back again, while also working with less of a school course load until spring semester starts. The ideal would be to buy my own car, but I barely have enough money for that, so it's not possible for me at the moment.

128,metalanejack,1625242327,/r/college/comments/ocdcnt/am_i_making_the_right_decision/,"Hello r/college

(TLDR at 2nd to last paragraph)

I am grateful that I have the opportunity to consult a community about the daunting, yet ecstatic college applying process! To start off, and to explain what my dilemma is, let me give some brief background:

I’m 18 years old, a citizen of the state of Massachusetts, and have just graduated from High-School. Throughout my entire school career, I never thought about college… even once. That is, until last month a few days after I graduated, that something “woke up” inside me, and lit a flame of passion and motivation to take the future of my life seriously. I don’t know what happened exactly, but I’m extremely thankful for whatever it was that happened inside of me. Anyway, as I stated previously I live in Massachusetts (I don’t want to say what specific town/city, for privacy reasons), and due to that I’ve been mostly scouting exclusively in Massachusetts because out-of-state tuition is typically too expensive for me.

Now, one thing I need to mention is that I do plan on going to community college this fall, and I want to transfer out to a university after 1 year. Now, I haven’t fully figured how I’ll do that just yet as certain colleges require a certain number of transferable credits, associates degree, etc. Perhaps I’ll need to apply as a first year student? But that’s not my main concern right now.

To cut to the chase, the college that I’ve pinned down right now as my target is Umass Amherst. Why did I choose that college? Well, as I was browsing the various options in the state I concluded that Umass Amherst was simply the highest quality university relative to its cost and acceptance rate (obviously there’s Harvard and MIT but are way too expensive). However, as I continued browsing my ambitions grew in parallel. According to the research I conducted, it seems that UCLA is the highest rated and most prestigious university in the country that is not an Ivy League, or in other words crazy expensive/extremely selective (even though UCLA’s acceptance rate is very low). I knew by this point that I was getting greedy. “There’s no way a place like UCLA will accept me, I’m a joke to them. They’ll laugh at someone like me who has only one year of CC experience no matter how good my SAT score or GPA are” I thought to myself. So I settled back down with Umass. 

My question is though, say I hypothetically get accepted into both, which one will need up being the better choice (I still don’t fully know what field I want to enter, but somewhere in the realm of computer science and the arts). I’ve done quite a bit of research into Umass, and have seen many great things people have said about it, such as the wonderful campus, the student life, the class diversity, etc. Overall, I feel that academically and socially I would be very happy there, however, while UCLA would cost almost double ($40,000 vs. $20,000 per year) would it be worth it? The big city, the California life, etc. Are there oppurtunities (job or otherwise) that UCLA would give me that Umass couldn’t? How does the student life compare, the campus, the courses, the connections and professors, etc? Will I regret going to Umass over UCLA, and vice versa? I really don’t know yet if I’d rather live in a small/medium sized town, or one of the countries biggest cities. 

From what I’ve researched it seems that no matter which I pick they’ll both give me great academic and social opportunities, and are both filled with bright, brilliant, and beautiful people. I want my college experience to be filled with wonder, independence, freedom, curiosity, and growth, as well as great social experiences, connections, various resources, professors, etc. I know that no place will be perfect, and will likely have certain political, student freedom, and etc problems.

129,MemeQueen1414,1625179063,/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,"Hi there, this is going to be a big huge post, so prepare yourself now for a dumpster filled with information. I am 19 almost 20 and I am a Sophomore in College (Go Owls: FAU) I been at home since the pandemic (graduated HS in 2020 and then started college soon after virtual) and home life has been worsening significantly and I don't know what to do at all and I been at my wits both emotionally and mentally since I feel trapped, I feel useless, I feel sad bc I'm always being compared to by other ppl or my older sibling, I feel un heard and not being respected or listen to at all, and expectations set for me is unreasonable or if I somehow achieve it then parents back track/change their minds or make me feel like shit or vice versa.

I suspected I have a learning disability (ADHD &amp; Potentially Autism Scale) more than what limited information I know about my Speech and Language Disorder (which family never give a fuck about and usually be by myself in my IEP Meetings in HS) and my accommodations from HS bc of S&amp;L Disorder didn't transfer since my college requires a documentation from a Therapist &amp; Psychologist to which idk where to even begin since I'm all on my own and barley have any money. My close friends that I talk to about this also suspected that I have Depression, Anxiety and maybe even Bipolar (Ma is suspected to have it since she is crazy as hell and they want me to be tested bc genetics is a lovely thing, and don't want me to be off guard even tho haven't shown signs of it) but like what I need for accommodations for college I don't know where to even begin since this is overwhelming and I am afraid of not being able to tackle those issues or just continuing to deal with it ""on my own"" or be silent as usual 

I already applied and got accepted for single dorm housing on campus (have 2 or 3 roommates, originally 3 but one drop and is vacant but its a 4 bedroom housing where we share 2 bathrooms and have a private bedroom) with a 12 meal a week food plan for the upcoming Fall semester but I'm afraid, one because haven't told parents and don't drive (have permit since end of sophomore year in HS via driver's ed class after much hell in doing so, but need practice and anxious of driving both from parents yelling first then teach, Ma telling me I stole or mess up something in her car [isn't true bc I don't take from my own parents in terms of valuable stuff, things like gum or food yea but never money or what Ma accused me of taking or screwing up when I drive in her car] or me being Black and Femme lending NB) nor own a car and two, I'm anxious they just guilt me in staying and I be more stuck then ever. I'm tired of being so useless, I'm trying to stay steady for my friends and even tho my parents (more so my Ma since she calls me worthless and hopes stuff happen to me while Dad is passive and always working 2 jobs, he's a hard worker but hes strict and traditional, always goes with what Ma says even when she's wrong and then always making me have to apologize even when Ma as usual go past my boundaries or make me feel like I would be better off dead instead of adding onto the bill by living here) besides Dad I guess and maybe my older brother (don't have a good relationship but not as bad as Ma just neutral) prob would be happy if anything happens to me

I'm all on my own and idk how to do much in terms of being an adult. I know how to separate clothes and put them in the dryer then fold them as well as ironing but I never start a washer machine (at best Ik the soap and detergent stuff goes but dk like water temperature and which is the best setting for the type of clothes) my cooking skills is microwave or things that are simple since all my life my family made cleaning and cooking a ""female"" job and I reject that bc it was so stupid growing up seeing my Ma cook and what not then be pissed when I don't do so but when my brother does she says that he can stop and she wants me. Yea ik it bite me in the ass but I don't like being told I have to do something just bc I have a uterus, not to mention at least for this semester, we don't have a stove in the housing dorm and only a community housing kitchen in one of the floors. I know how to wash, put away and start a dish washer, swept the house and clean the bathroom but not sure if I need to learn more skills that I'm just either blankin out, never taught/get frighten by being told to go away and don't learn or vice versa

Idk what to do in terms of clothing or hair since one, a lot of clothes in my closet needs major updating since I detested the clothes I wear (a good 85% don't match what I want nor gender identity) and also shopping bc Ma always had to start something or when I get something she later takes it either bc she is upset or when I used to have report cards in K-12 whenever it didn't met her expectations it would get taken away same with birthday or Christmas gifts then takes it long enough she regifts it and me being a dummy I lowkey forgot about it so I get excited for the same stuff twice. Then bonus pts for Ma in comparing me with my older brother or other ppl who did better than me. I want to cut my hair bc I heard the symbolism that cutting your hair means change but I want something low maintenance that I be able to embrace my Haitian &amp; Black Ethnicity as well as learning how to manage my 4c Texture Hair since I am a newbie and dk the products nor braiding to do on myself (I tried on my childhood doll but I just keep on messing up and got sad so I just figured I'ma always have to pay or deal with my hair on my own). Once again I do not know how to go about this so I feel trapped and discouraged already

I don't know how to pack for dorms and not even sure if family would help me without it being a battle or worse make me cancel my housing and then depend on Ma to drive 45 min to and from college. I tried to compromise and said Tri Rail, Ride Sharing with a Friend or Apps, or Bus, parents said no and said that I have to depend on Ma since Dad always working and I don't want to do that both bc even tho I'm so behind in being an adult (*Sniffles*) 

I'm trying even tho I need guidance without being yelled at or hurt or overstimulated (being yelled at by different ppl is a good way or that party noise thingy you blow is also another way to cause me to react) and that I want space, I need air and I need help both for myself to be in a better place so I can live life beyond always being at home and always doing school (which is harder with no accommodations, being in a unsupportive household, indirectly being attacked on my gender and sexuality even tho haven't been out [Religious parents but usually Ma for this], classes isn't interesting and want to take classes that means something like major classes or classes that is more helpful than a General Ed Class can give hence the distractions but just have to force myself to work through it but its becoming harder to do so than b4) never hanging with friends or talkin on the phone (I was on a phone with a friend I haven't spoken to well besides text that is since the pandemic started then my Dad yell at me for being on the phone and then told me to do something Ma wanted me to do, it was to close the TV [Bruh] and then after that Ma told me all I do is eat, shit, be on my laptop/phone and sleep, then proceeds to attack and belittle me) or just have the freedom, the confidence and at ease to be a almost 20 year old in college.

I need help and in Mid August thats when move in day for my college begins (don't have an exact date yet) and I really dk where to begin so I can have a better year in college (I started off ok in Fall and Spring with a 3.52 GPA but then my summer classes kick my ass badly and I ended up withdrawing from a class [during add and drop week for 2nd half of summer thankfully] failing 3 classes (1 class but Canvas divides the 3 credit class into lecture and lab so that's technically 2) then Accounting 1 kick my ass (have to retake it in the Fall bc its required for a business major) bc of our Douchebag prof. The only class I manage to pass was Micro with a C which I'm upset on bc Ik I could have gotten an A but bc of me feeling more discouraged, feeling depressed, I just barley pull through and I feel so freaking guilty about it enough that I'm like bawling in my room for a week and a half privately as I hear in the background how worthless I am and a waste of space by Ma. 

Dad is always working and then whenever he does see me he just be upset at me and always makes me be around Ma 24/7 or told me that have some knowledge do something with my life or act like I have sense or be smart and whenever I do try like telling my parents about this Part Time Job in Mid April, about 10 min away from my house, my folks laugh in my face and then when I get to tell them the bonus of having 1,500 in money after a certain amount of time on the job, they told me to take my ass to CVS/Walgreens (Dad wants me to work in Medical as a first job and in a clean environment even tho I did and got rejected or never call back to which Dad pointed out the other ppl younger than me and made me feel like shit when he told me ""How come I can't be like them"" then told me to try again even tho we in like the worst job unemployment of our time like its so simple, I had so much tears whenever I eagerly open up a email from a job then get crushed when as usual don't get picked or saying their hold my file, told Dad and he says to try harder and stop making excuses and that I'ma feel it when I'm older don't want to do anything with my life) then being told I'm lucky I don't be hired and then fired in the same day.

Ma told me if I was a cart pusher like in the groccery store she would not even bat an eye to me and Dad has this expectations of me working in medical and clean which funny enough the job, Uniform Advantage fit everything that Dad wanted and a bonus it was in business something that I'm actually majoring in but parents never remember and still salty I'm not in Nursing in terms of a major. Hell, my Ma until recently used to lie to my other family members on how I went to other college and taking another major and don't even freakin acknowledge what I'm in and always as usual boast about how great and awesome my older brother is. I hate being told I'm not good enough, yes I freakin know it for years now, u don't have to repeat something I already know. And Dad for the longest time was pissed that I stand up to him and told him I don't want to be in nursing (For Haitian Kids we only got 6 career paths, Basketball or Football, Doctor, Nurse, Lawyer &amp; Engineer when a kid go against that parents flips their shit bc they want a kid to have a stable and known career with bonus pts of bragging rights ofc) and wanted to be in Health Administration/Human Resources and overall Business Aspect, he told me I'ma regret it and even now still feel like shit for standing up and making him upset but I guess its one of the many things I can't just help in making my parents upset about.

Anyways continuing on, when I told my Dad when we went out to shop for food a few weeks back the store and where its at, Dad told me no then when I ask him why he told me its not medical, I reply back its a medical business that sells Scrubs for medical professionals like nurses and assistants, then he told me to apply to CVS and Walgreens which I told him why I can't as explain earlier, then he told me to apply to T-Mobile, I asked Dad in confusion how the heck T-Mobile is medical unless I missed a huge memo that T-Mobile sells Medical Devices instead of phones idk how its medical. I love my Dad but damn it he be contradicting himself and then he tells me I'm being disrespectful whenever I talk back or ask for clarification (hence I be silent and stay confused a lot leading me to get yelled at a lot since idk what I was being asked and when I ask for clarification I get told to have some sense and to figure it out) but anyways he told me that T-Mobile was clean and I legit had to fight off the urge to freakin face palm at this tho like omg Jesus Christ take the wheel.

I just need help, in terms of getting my life together and myself once I'm on campus if by some freakin miracle Parents don't start shit or make me feel like shit and guilt me into canceling the housing contract. I need a part time job to start saving for Study Abroad which I want to do in Spring 2023 and Fall of 2023 of Junior year to Australia, I need money and I don't want to depend on family more than I already have to (ex: that stupid FAFSA) and not to mention it already hurts like mf hell to take out loans for Housing which I still owe even with with loans (sub and unsubsidized loans from FAFSA) and maximum Pell Grant, I need to pay a lil over 750 out of pocket to pay clear off my balance for the fall term and its going to be the same for Spring housing as well. 

The area near my college is expensive as hell and I doubt my folks will cosign me an apartment and even if they did where the hell is a college student going to come up with 1700 per month without sacrificing full time college or being in a bad position to pay it off even with roommates its still expensive not to mention I'm not trying to scare off ppl or be afraid or deal with much ppl since I already come from a rough background I do not want to take out loans and want not just to be in the same environment again. I just feel like I'm trapped since I legit choose being in debt which I avoided for the longest then staying at home and being debt free but feel like shit.

I'm scared that my folks is going to be right and I continue to be useless, I'm trying and I feel like I'm drowning in not being able to function correctly for not being like other ppl my age is doing, I'm just tired of being this way, I didn't ask for this, to be this complicated, to be always being in pain, too hopeful, too optimistic even when hurt, too always being slow and useless, I just don't know how to feel at all anymore

I think this is a good stopping point, there is plenty I could say about my family, but I think y'all can have an idea, I just need some help with dealing with Extreme Helicopter and Toxic (more so Ma but Dad has his moments) parents with impossible expectations and making me feel like no matter how much I try I can never do it, I just end up wasting everyone's time just like what Ma always tells me. I need help with this college stuff as well, I just need help with a lot and stop feeling like I'm drowning.

Even with Ma harsh words and Dad's critical and passive, I don't hate them, I should when it comes to my Mother at least, I still have a few decent memories on whenever Ma is not being a bitch or breakin me further on how she used to be proud on when I do something like she still keep that hand print I did in 1st grade as a Mother's day gift its on the counter of her bathroom, but even with the good memories I still have on her, it doesn't replace her words or actions in the present or rather previous actions and it hurts like hell so much. I be lying if I say I'm not effected by Mother anymore, that I don't constantly wish for her to change or it be back to where it used to, that I secretly envy the ppl that had understanding and great parents. 

Yea I have a roof over my head, food on the table, a bed and then clothes but that's not enough. I don't feel supported, I feel like I'm an inconvenience, I feel like I'm here bc I have to be, I feel like I'm not living a life and its just a endless cycle that I can't escape from, I feel guilty for feeling like this since ppl have it way worse than I do, I feel like my feelings don't matter and that it's ok I'm being treated like this since for the longest time I thought (and still is even when friends told me it isn't) was normal, I been told my feelings don't matter (Mother) or idk what stress is since idk how to work and I'm a piece of shit (Mother again) so idk where to even go about for this at all, need advice please and thank you",college,How Does One Improve Their Life After Leaving Toxic Helicopter Parents Household (Well Trying Too) For College (Sophomore),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/obx13y/how_does_one_improve_their_life_after_leaving/,1625197063.0

So while going through the process I found a better school and let them know that I didn't want to enroll. The private school was several times more expensive than the school I ended up enrolling in. 

About a day or two after I told them I found a different school someone called me saying I had to fix the information because it was wrong so I let the person know I no longer wanted to enroll. 

So now like 6 weeks later I get an email and automated phone call saying I owed money in tuition and that I was enrolled in the school. What I don't understand is how did they enroll me if they said my information was wrong and it had to be fixed even after I told them twice I didn't want to enroll. So I tried to log into the student account they made me and it no longer let me.

134,Boneless_Blaine,1623775918,/r/college/comments/o0iwhk/my_own_procrastination_and_poor_planning_have/," For the last two years, I’ve been going to a community college working on my AA degree while living with my dad and grandmother. My college has an agreement with a large state university that students who get their AA here can be automatically accepted and have their credits transfer seamlessly. My plan was to take this deal and commute to the university for two years while earning my BS in Computer Engineering.

I just got my AA degree at the end of the last spring semester but my housing situation changed unexpectedly when my grandmother passed and we had to sell her house. My dad found a small apartment to live in temporarily until I figured out where I wanted to live for college. 

My first mistake was actually filling out my application for the state college much too late. I think I submitted it in early-mid April. I did not anticipate that the university would take 8 weeks to process my application and accept me. Now that I’ve finally been accepted, I’ve realized this was far far too late. 

I finished my AA with a perfect 4.0 GPA, and my assumption was that I would be offered at least a modest academic scholarship package as a condition of my acceptance just like when I was applying to universities out of high school. FAFSA is able to cover the cost of my tuition and I have been reassuring my dad since we lost the house that a scholarship could cover my housing costs. 

Unfortunately, I found out yesterday that this university does not automatically generate scholarship offers for transfers, only incoming freshmen, and the two transfer scholarship applications had deadlines far before I was even accepted. I called the financial aid office to basically be told I’m out of luck. So now, after thousands of hours of studying ridiculous hours seven days a week, my hard work is going to be rewarded with absolutely nothing because of my own procrastination and poor planning.

In addition, because it took so much longer to be accepted than I thought, securing on-campus housing is looking almost impossible. Even if I can get accepted, I now dont have any option to pay for it except for out of my own savings. I can technically afford it without loans, but that’s pretty much all the money I have. My dad is willing to find us both a place to live near campus, but it’s so difficult because the city of my university is extremely expensive and overpopulated. If we do find a place together, the rent is coming right out of my life savings too.

I am at a complete loss. I have no idea what to tell my dad who has worked so hard to help me get through college. I dont know where I’m going to live in 2 months. I dont know how to pay for my education. I don’t even have any passion or excitement for the university I applied for, I just thought it would be a good way to get out of college quickly and with no debt. Now I have to come up with some sort of solution and I truly have no idea what to do.

136,Haunting_Salad_4863,1622347868,/r/college/comments/no35ee/i_must_choose_wisely_and_i_need_your_help/,"Hi, I hope you can bear with me, I am a Tunisian who recently graduated from Saudi Arabia high school at age 17 with perfect grades (+A) and I want to study medicine. The Universities will open gates soon so I must take a decision as soon as possible.

To begin with, I applied to French medical universities with level B2 language but they required C1 level so they gave me admission to study polytechnic and engineering (I prefer to study In English rather than French).

Same thing goes to Canada, they accepted me in polytechnic, engineering, biochemistry and biology. In order to study medicine, You need permanent residency, so you have to study one of the previous programs for 4 years and then you can start studying medicine. 

My dream country to study in is Germany so I considered to begin my studies there, but they need a language certificate (B1-C1), an exam called TestAS, In addition, my diploma is missing one year so I must study for 1 year the language and a preparatory year (Studienkolleg) so It will be 2 years, there is a competiotion between students for acceptance rate which is very low especially for international students.

So I have one of these solutions:

1) Stay In Saudi Arabia to study medicine for 6 years in a highly reputed university.
The problem is that tuition fees are 25k us dollars per year and in the last years it could reach 50k usd. Moreover, foreigners can't work here as doctors after graduating, it's accessible for citizens only.

2) Return to my homeland Tunisia and study medicine for free in the french language for 9 years. Luckily, I have a Tunisian friend who was my classmate in KSA, he is in Tunisia now planning to study pharmacy, maybe we can live together and join the same university.
The problem is that it isn't safe to live there and you may get robbed at any time, also people want to immigrate for a better learning opportunities.

3) Studying Medicine in English at Germany in UMCH University in Hamburg for 6 years. Since I am planning to specialize in Germany, living there would make that easier. However, the fees are 34k us dollars just for a Romanian diploma (which it's diploma is accepted in the EU anyway).
Moments ago I searched for Kassel school of medicine, the fees are cheaper, the first 2 years you will study in the UK doing scientific researches, at the third year you can continue studying in Germany, I am still searching for further details, I will be glad If someone could provide me with more information concerning this college.

4) Maybe the best option so far is going to Charles university, number one uni in Czech republic.
Before entering, you need to attend a 5 months preparation course studying scientific subjects which you had studied In high school but it's more elaborated in this course, so It's like wasting a whole year, during that time, I can enrich my knowledge and my German level.
The fees are 19k us dollars every year for 6 years and you have to learn the Czech language to cope with people there which is a hurdle.

5) I took a glance at universities in Italy that teaches In English, you need to take the IMAT test in September but at that time It's too late and you can't really depend on it, though It's a good option.
I also heard about Polish universities and I would like more detailes about them.

6) I got a preparatory course in Ireland but It's not a part of any university, after you finish the course, they will choose where to study, UK, Cyprus, the Caribbeans, which are all expensive.

I'm preparing for IELTS during this vacation, I should also prepare for other exams.

137,AncientDominion,1622340413,/r/college/comments/no1bhs/would_it_be_worth_it_to_take_on_student_debt_for/,"So, disclaimer: I know many students will take out loans at some point, but I've been fortunate enough to go to a very affordable community college and will be able to pay totally out of pocket during my time at my CC, which is why the thought of having to take out loans is sorta intimidating. 

I'm just over halfway done with my associate of science degree and its time to really get down to the wire about where I'm gonna be transferring to to finish out my bachelor's degree. I absolutely love biochem, and as mentioned I'm not planning on going down the premed track since my end goal is to ultimately end up in research of some sort, or even food science type stuff, just something hands on and not directly working with or on people. I guess the problem is, the two schools I'm looking to transfer to are UT Dallas, which is more of a commuter school and would allow me to continue living at home (thus saving money), or UT Austin, which I'd have to move for and would be more expensive but could possibly afford me more opportunities for my career and as an adult, since I'm 22 and am looking to actually begin my adult life. 

Luckily I'm a TX resident already, and UT Austin is still my ideal pick. I currently have about 37 completed hours and a 4.0 GPA but the rigor at my school isn't great so I don't try to put too much stock into that and I'm not expecting that to stay the same wherever I transfer or even by the time I actually have an associate's degree, and I'm also not super hopeful about getting any scholarships or whatnot. I do get financial aid but right now, that only means getting a grant from the state to help cover costs. 

So I guess I'm torn between really pushing to get into UT Austin and just taking out more loans for the different opportunities it might give, OR just continue on my current track of not really doing anything special and just going to UT Dallas, saving money by living at home and commuting, still having to take out some loans but not as much, but likely delaying starting my adult life even more. But I also figure, if I only have to take out 2 years of loans because I was debt free the first 2, would it really be that bad compared to the situations some others are in? 

Any advice to set me straight would be much appreciated.",college,Would it be worth it to take on student debt for a biochemistry degree at my ideal transfer school OR save money and commute?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/no1bhs/would_it_be_worth_it_to_take_on_student_debt_for/,1622358413.0
138,Automatic-Ad8,1622201985,/r/college/comments/nmvyik/do_i_choose_a_cheap_school_with_few_resources_for/,"I am an incoming freshman and so far I am having issues making a decision between my two cheapest schools. I have searched through so many threads for help on this but I am still unsure what to do. That’s why I posted. 

Background: I am a US citizen living abroad. I applied for the FAFSA on time but due to some issues for personal reasons, the first FAFSA was rejected and I was unable to send a new one until April. I was also selected for verification so my financial aid has only just been processed by my schools meaning that I missed all the scholarships requiring FAFSA that I could have been eligible for at my schools. This is very depressing because I worked hard to get good stats for the schools. Anyways, my EFC is 0 and so far my family has no dollars in their account to pay for college. They only have the equivalent in my current country of residence and it’s SUPER expensive. 

I don’t care for prestige or whether the school is a party school or not. I only care about the quality of academics and cost of attendance. This reduced my school choices from 4 to 2 and so far these are the schools I am having trouble choosing between:

University of Houston 

- This is the preferred choice between the two.
- The most important thing is that the range of opportunities available for my major at UH far exceeds the opportunities at my second school. 
- I am in the Honors college and my major is honors biomedical sciences. I am very excited to study this major and I am eager to take advantage of all the awesome pre-med opportunities available at UH. I want opportunities that will help me excel and be well prepared for medical school. 
- The major is full of amazing helpful teachers (according to other redditors) and the environment suits me as I am an introvert and not eager to go out partying. 
- However, since I submitted my FAFSA late, I have not been able to get any scholarships from this school. And I am ineligible for in state tuition so I’ll have to work hard and get scholarships and private loans to pay 30k a year for my fees. I am fully prepared to do this but I am unsure about if the debt after school would be worth it, especially since I will be attending medical school as well. 
- I can also get an appeal but at most it’ll reduce the cost of attendance to 20k if I’m lucky as appealing so late might not work out for me. 

My second option is:

Texas Tech University

- It’s in the middle of nowhere. This is my first time moving to America. I’d prefer to be close to family in a city. 
- No matter how optimistic I try to be and no matter how hard I look I can’t seem to find as many or barely a handful of opportunities for pre meds at texas tech. 
- I am not excited for my major at texas tech. It is cell and molecular biology. I would prefer a major that mixes the arts and sciences like UH Honors biomedical sciences. I can always manage the major. Its not a huge issue, it’s more like a tiny inconvenience. HOWEVER from what I’ve read, the biology department at Texas Tech is not good at all and I just want a place where I can thrive academically. 
- It is a party school and I do not like learning atmospheres like that. Although, I can always just avoid the parties so that’s also not a big issue. 
- My friends in Texas have also discouraged me from attending Texas Tech because (in their words) it’s just a party school and the quality of the school is reducing and those attending the school are not too happy there. 
- The only good thing about the school is that I fortunately got a scholarship making me eligible for in state tuition. I’ll only have to pay 10k and if I do appeal, I could pay 5k or less to attend the school. 

All in all the biggest thing preventing me from fully committing to Texas Tech is the quality of my department and lack of pre med opportunities there. 

Is there any advice you all could offer me on which school I should choose? Is the debt worth it for University of Houston?

Fafsa would pay for me to live in a single, as opposed to continuing to live with roommates in LA w/o school obligations.

This may sound privileged af but i honestly dont know what decision sounds more ideal. 

Im covered for tuition and housing by fafsa as an independent student. I dropped out of college last fall during covid as a sophmore in economics. 
 
I moved to la to pursue a music career and am now a part time studio engineer/ producer with goals to become an independent artist as well as finance myself thru entrepeneurial hustles. If you cant tell ive had a complete change in mindset on college, but i feel like maybe im not alone?

So I got accepted into University of Toronto for chemical engineering.

However, I kinda find this very expensive especially since it's for an undergraduate degree. (I'm an international student). 

On the other hand, I applied to a local school in my country as well for management engineering course (under business school).

I like both fields of study but I'm kinda scared of wasting the money spent in Toronto since it's quite a big sum.

Now, my debate is simple. I attend ASU online which is fairly expensive, so I’m worried about the extra cost of taking the full French sequence.

That nobody actually cares, they'll just relate to you and send ""virtual hugs"" over the Internet.

No chance of success without internships I'm unqualified for. Shitty commutes, courses, and stress all the way. That college pretends that it offers anything else is insulting, and that my dad just confirmed this is always been the case is infuriating because nothing so far has proved him wrong.

I’m just going to list all the places I’ve been accepted, explain the pros and cons, and hopefully some of you guys can help me clear my head. I want to teach in the future. I live in California, but I will not be giving away the names of any of the schools on here. 

School A: super prestigious, one of the best universities in my state, very low acceptance rate. It’s five hours from the city I live in, and it’s in a small college town. This place was my dream school for a long time, but I have two really big problems with it: there is a lot of racism on campus, and it is WAY too expensive. I can get my tuition nearly covered by grants and scholarship money, but housing would cost more 10k per year- living off campus is nearly just as expensive. I have gotten really turned off from it in the past few months because of these issues.

School B: The state school 40 minutes from home. I can live at home, which is great, but there would be a long commute every day. It is affordable, but I’ve heard is pretty socially dead, and it just doesn’t feel like the right fit. The academics are not as good as School A, but it is a very diverse school and housing wouldn’t be an issue.  

Option 3: community college, and transfer to a four year after two years. This feels like the best option, but I am scared that I’m going to fall behind and not be able to transfer.. or that two years won’t be enough time to figure out what to do. There are very good community colleges in the city I live in, and two really good public universities in my city that I could transfer to (if I do well enough- I wanted to go to either of these two schools originally, but didn’t get accepted to either)

152,morenxlife,1618878281,/r/college/comments/muehrj/how_to_get_an_internship_step_2_the_application/,"Hi everyone! I got a lot of positive feedback on my last post so here’s the next step in the internship process.


Okay so you’ve gathered all your potential internship/work sites...now it’s time to actually *apply*. 

I understand this can be an incredibly grueling process and industries have totally different standards - for tech they’ll want to see useful projects whereas in the humanities they may be more interested in your writing and research skills - which may add to any confusion. Whatever it is the industry and organization is looking for, make sure to highlight how you meet those needs (even if you feel like you don’t meet all of the qualifications!) by doing thorough research - this will guide how you structure your cover letter, resume, other application materials + what you share in your interview.

Please remember that most students usually apply to tons of internship programs, many receive multiple rejection letters, and none of it is a personal affront. There’s always going to be someone with a better application than you and there’s always going to be someone with a worse application than you, so don’t let this define your self worth or think it’s indicative of how successful you or your career will be. 

If you want to improve, ask for feedback from the hiring committee (but they may not be able to give any), an advisor, or industry professional but *don’t* torture yourself with any mistakes you may have made. 

General Advice:
Double check eligibility! This is especially important if you’re a college freshman, sophomore, or recent grad (1 year or less out of college). A lot of internships have restrictions on who is eligible to apply, which means underclassmen and new grade are frequently excluded (or, are not considered a priority applicant) from the applicant pool. 

Double check the requirements! One of the worst feelings is missing out on a great opportunity over a silly mistake - make sure you know which documents you have to provide for an application and when you to have submit it. It doesn’t matter how great your resume is if you’re missing a letter of recommendation - to keep things fair, a vast majority of companies will automatically decline to review an incomplete application. 

If an organization doesn’t have internship information on their website buuuut you still really want to intern there, you CAN “cold email” (straight up asking if you can intern there while proving a copy of your resume, despite the company lacking a formal internship program). If possible, look for a department specific email or an employee’s email rather a general, company-wide one. This is more likely to work at a small, local company/organization and it’s also more likely this internship will be unpaid. 

If you know someone who has interned there/is interning there or is currently working at your target organization, then ask them questions about the company + application process. They may help, they may not; the conversation may be beneficial, ultimately it might not be - regardless, it doesn’t really hurt to ask (especially for organizations with a giant applicant pool).

Quality over quantity. This may vary upon your field, but applying to dozens of jobs probably means your capacity to research the company and why you want to work there is pretty limited and this subpar work tends to lead to a subpar application. I’ve seen wayyyy too many posts about students applying to 50+ companies, wasting their time and energy. Narrow down your top dozen or so choices and pour energy into creating an application someone will want to look twice. For anecdotal evidence, I applied to 8 internships for Summer, was accepted to 3, rejected by 3, withdrew from 1, and ghosted by 1, giving me a success rate of 37.5% which is pretty decent! 

If you get rejected during one application cycle this doesn’t mean you can’t apply again! I’ve received two acceptance letters and two rejection letters from the same company - if you really want to work there there’s no shame in being persistent. 

Keep your LinkedIn updated! I don’t mean that after every new resume addition you need to create a post that you’re “excited and humbled to accept an offer at Company X,” (though you may be encouraged to by the company itself) but make sure all your accomplishments and descriptions are up to date, all the information on there (including comments you’ve made) are things you are comfortable with an employer seeing, and that you’ve utilized every inch of space LinkedIn provides for an employer to get to know you, your interests, and your goals (especially your Summary and Featured sections, which tend to be woefully underused). 

Utilize LinkedIn’s “Summary” section to create a quick blurb about yourself, your school/your year in school, a bit about your personal background (ex: maybe you’re a proud Minnesotan? A first gen college student?), what you’re studying and how this connects to your interests and career goals, and any additional information you feel is necessary. 

Take advantage of LinkedIn’s “Feature” section to highlight any interesting projects you’d like an employer to learn about, any interesting achievements, (did your school write an article about you for winning an award or scholarship? link it here!) etc.

The Application Process, Step by Step:
(Organizing, Resume/Cover Letter, Letters of Rec., Transcript, Essays, Submission)

	1.	Organizing your applications. It is absolutely IMPERATIVE to keep track of deadlines throughout this process - I cannot stress enough how easy it is to get overwhelmed by school, your job, extracurriculars, and life’s many responsibilities and forget about an application deadline. It doesn’t matter how intelligent, experienced, or qualified you are - if you miss the deadline there is a 99.999% chance they wouldn’t let you turn in an application late. 
	2.	I recommend making a Google Folder where you keep alllllllll your application materials - a document to track application deadlines (a spreadsheet may be best if you’re planning to apply to a lot of companies), standard documents (recent transcript and letters of recommendation IF you are allowed to see your LOR), application questions, cover letters, etc. 
	3.	In the document where you track deadlines, note when you asked people for letters of recommendation, when the recommenders submitter a LOR, when you submitted an application, got rejected, etc. This will allow you to know when to follow up on things (ex: you asked someone a LOR 3 weeks ago and haven’t gotten a response, you can tell based on your deadlines sheet it’s time to follow up) and take the appropriate action. 
	4.	Update your resume (and cover letter, if you use a cover letter template). Your resume is one of the most important - if not the most important - component of your application and can truly make or break an application. If you don’t have one already make a “Master Resume” - this will be a large document (more than one page) that contains all your education, work, leadership, and volunteer experiences + scholarships and awards. After creating a bullet point description for each experience (and it can be several bullet points, the idea is that you can eventually copy and paste different lines to customize your resume for each application), have someone else (preferably an advisor or someone working full time in your industry) review your work and encourage them to be absolutely BRUTAL in their review. It can be a serious ego bruise, but it’s better that they catch it than realize you made mistakes after submitting the application. Repeat this step until you have a Master Resume you’re happy with. Also, make sure to update this regularly (1-2x an academic term and after every new accomplishment). 
	5.	The same principle can be applied to cover letters - create a standard formula or set of topics to cover, then adjust it to fit the organization. 
	6.	After this, you should be able to create a 1 page resume to accompany each application. When the 1 page version is completed, I still recommend having another person double check your work for any grammatical errors or formatting issues. I’m not sure if a “standard resume” format truly exists, since different countries, industries, companies, and hiring managers have their own preferences. As a general rule of thumb, limit the amount of “distractions” (bright colors, images, symbols), use strong, diverse action verbs to describe accomplishments (instead of “wrote” use “composed”), and quantify your experiences (instead of “fulfilled customer orders” write “fulfilled 10,000 customer orders on a weekly basis”).
	7.	If you don’t have a lot of previous internship experience, highlight any projects you’ve completed, completions you’ve won, papers you’ve written, research, leadership, awards, etc. If you’ve had a job before but don’t feel like it’s “relevant” (shoutout to my fellow fast food workers) still include it, but emphasize transferable skills like efficiency and customer service. 
	8.	Ask for letters of recommendation EARLY! I’ve heard 1-2 months is best practice, especially if you’re asking a professor who receives dozens of requests. I recommend doing this right after you’re done making your resume, as many recommenders may ask for your resume or another document to help guide their LOR. Be specific in what you want them to write - if you want to highlight your strong research skills then ask them to do do directly and politely, they’re not mind readers! Give them as much detail as possible about the internship - what company is it at, what are the highlights of the program, what’s the deadline, are there specific qualifications the company is searching for? This is important to know so they can write a thorough letter. Make sure to follow up with them - at the latest - a week before the LOR is due; there have definitely been students who couldn’t complete an application due to a late LOR and it’s a crappy feeling, to say the least.  
	9.	Request your transcript early, especially if the company wants a physical copy of it! At some schools, requesting transcripts can be expensive and time consuming so I recommend getting this out of the way as early as you can to make sure you have the financial resources for it and that it’ll arrive in time. 
	10.	If you’re in an industry that typically asks for essays as part of the application process *cried in humanities major* try to create a standard essay answer for questions like “Why are you passionate about x topic?,” “What are your career goals and how can x organization help you meet these goals?,” “Why do you want to intern for x company?,” “Please write about one major issue and how you envision solving it.” Again, I’m studying political science + environmental policy so these questions tend to be more geared towards humanities major,  but I would venture to say that each industry has a pretty standard set of questions, so find out what they are and be prepared to answer it. Whenever you apply for internships, SAVE all the questions and identify the common patterns - this will save you so much time in the end. 
	11.	Think of the essay/cover letter as a chance to create a strong, cohesive narrative that complements your resume and other application materials. Ultimately, the entire application is a storytelling exercise for the candidate. 
	12.	Group applications in folders based on topics to fill them out even faster. For example, at Companies A - D their internship programs revolve around electoral politics while Companies E - H revolve around climate change; develop a standard answer (using the advice in the previous bullet point) for each topic - electoral politics and climate change - and apply it to the relevant applications. Though still time consuming, it’s easier than developing something totally original each time. For my junior summer internship hunt, I did this and the essay portion of the application process was pretty much a breeze. 
	13.	After you’ve assembled all your application materials, go ahead and have someone double check it again. Yes, the name of the game here is double checking! Again, I recommend an advisor or professional of some type who’s more likely to be brutally (but in a good way) honest with you.
	14.	Make sure to submit it in the correct application portal - even if a posting is shown on a third party website (LinkedIn) they may want it submitted to their own company site portal, to a specific email, etc. Read the instructions! This is basically your first test as an intern. 
	15.	If the portal or individual you are submitting the application to notes that you are supposed to get an email confirmation (this confirms you did actually submit something) then make sure you actually get this confirmation email. If for whatever reason a company says they never received an application for you this is your “receipt.” 
	16.	*Fight* the urge to panic and demand a response from them in one week. Remember that hosting interns is a smalllllll component of an organization’s work. If they have an application timeline (ex: round 1 will be completed by x date, round 2 will be completed by y date) expect them to be late/fall behind. Is it fair that we have to submit everything on time while they may delay the response process? Probably not, but unfortunately, that’s the game. If you have special circumstances where you need to hear back sooner (ex: you’ve received multiple offers), then contact the relevant person but know they may not be able to accommodate you.

I'm a college sophomore right now, but since high school I've had a lot of trouble figuring out what I want to do. I initially applied to a pretty expensive out-of-state school (UIUC) because I wanted to get away from my family (nothing wrong with them, just my teenage angst, we get along very well now haha) AND it had a good program for my major, mostly. In hindsight, though, high school senior me was really dumb.

After freshman year, I realized that I wanted to major in graphic design instead, and changed my major. But now, because of that, I think I should consider transferring to an in-state school (in California). Here are my reasons:

1. It will most likely be a lot cheaper, saving me tens of thousands of dollars, although money is not the main reason why I want to transfer. I do hear that it isn't worth going out-of-state for an art degree.
2. Going to an in-state art school (Cali has a lot of these) will most likely have a better program for a career in graphic design, although I don't know how much of a difference it will make.
3. I miss my home state, and traveling between my college and my family's home is is an exhausting, expensive hassle (4-hour flight, sometimes requiring multiple stops, then a 4-hour bus ride, not to mention the 2-hour time difference) that I really hate having to do multiple times a year.

Potential reasons against transferring:

1. I currently don't have a very developed portfolio in terms of graphic design, although I have a lot of other work (illustration, drawings, etc.)
2. This is a really big decision, and I don't know if I'm just being wishy-washy and should just stay the course. It's always easier to stay where I am.
3. I'm not sure if it's already too late!

Are these reasons enough to justify transferring schools? When is the point of no return?",college,Help! Should I transfer in-state for an art degree?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mtubm3/help_should_i_transfer_instate_for_an_art_degree/,1618830085.0
154,throwaway43643442324,1618468671,/r/college/comments/mr962t/why_keep_going/,"Title. I don't see a reason for trying in school anymore, and to a broader extent life itself. The burnout, indifference to learning, not retaining what I learn, etc. is too much. I think I hate my major. I just want to do media editing, but am trapped in these bullshit prerequisite courses where I learn all these boring things about film theory and social justice that don't relate to it. I need to get through these courses to get to the upper division editing ones, and fuck me I don't even know if I'll like them once I get there. I don't want to direct student films, or work alongside exhausting student creatives/auteurs, or pick up a million unrelated, unpaid internships just to stay competitive in the job market, but my degree basically demands it. I guess I owe this all to my shitty planning...well, that and college is a scam. I wish someone warned me.

So, I have to get so far into my major to actually experience classes I might like, and if I don't, then switching majors from that point on will be a massive waste of time and money I don't have. No realistic backup major or anything of course, unless I'm prepared to go hungry. And that's just college; I'm so fucking unprepared for the real world. It takes all the effort I can muster just to get all As in classes, and every few days I give up on having a work ethic. I've got nothing else. There's no positives in my life anymore, and if there's no positives, why keep going? Tell me, I legitimately need some reasons to not take the easy way out of this bullshit. This post is just me narrowing down if there are some left. Don't post that dumbass suicide hotline, it's intensely unhelpful, almost makes me want to do it out of spite. How do you keep going?

But first, please don't bother with the ""it will get better"" pep talk. That's a lie people have been telling me for ~10 years now and I hate it. I'm downright resentful of it. I was told college is so much better than high school, then went into easy but unfulfilling and lonely community college. I've now transferred into my university and spent 2 semesters of painful Zoom U here. I've set foot on the campus once. My school's mostly back to normal next semester, but because I've been absorbed by the amorphous blob-like thing called online school I don't know if I can adapt.

My peace of mind is ruined; Physical classes means I'll have to commute to them. What are the three most nerve-wracking activities I've ever experienced? Driving in general; people are assholes, working shitty retail to pay for my insurance, and stressing through all the errands my mom will inevitably heap on me.

My sleeping schedule is ruined; how the fuck do I adjust to early classes after a year of asynchronous ones.

My study habits are ruined; I can't imagine memorizing things for a test anymore when they've all been open-book for so long. I think online school actually gave me ADHD- my attention span is shot and I can't pay attention to anything. I gave up reading any scholarly articles, i've tried and tried, I just can't. All I have is blind hope that it disappears when physical classes arrive.

My social life is preemptively ruined; Making friends online is and has always been a farce. Everyone's too hesitant and everything feels too awkward. I don't know my school, I don't know kids in my major. I do know I'm not going to have time for socializing and clubs once back because I now know how oppressive the college workload. Never mind that I'm socially stunted to begin with.

I hate online classes with a passion. I want to get away from them, but it's very likely I'm exchanging one shitshow for another by transitioning to physical. Different stressors, same quantity of them. Don't tell me things will get better. I understand as strangers you can't promise me many things with substance behind them, so if you can only post empty encouragement (#wegotthisfam #slayit), I'd rather you just not post anything at all.

Please don't bother to suggest therapy either. I've always been a little suicidal, but until this semester I never felt desperate enough to need therapy for it. What did I find when I looked for help? My school's counseling program has a 50/50 chance of actually helping me, or locking me up in an institution that could only make life more miserable. I can't take those odds. They're always trying to push you out to private therapists anyways.

I looked up those- I was gently told to fuck off by one organization in the consultation call because I couldn't afford the standard 12 weeks of sessions (over ~$1000). Fucksakes, I only wanted a few. Low-cost organizations are happy to have me...if I can wait 3-4 months. I wish they told me to fuck off too, honestly, because it's not like most people desperate enough to seek out therapy can just postpone their problems.

I discovered therapy in the U.S. is as much a joke as our traditional healthcare is: available but too expensive, or inexpensive but always unavailable. It's not an option, for me at least. Finding that out after so, so many people said it's worked wonders for them, hurt. It really hurt.

But, at risk of going beyond subreddit parameters, how do you keep going in life? I like to think I've ""accepted"" that I'll never live up to my unrealistic pipedreams, or that I won't find love, or have my own place, etc. but I still get sad over these things. I don't know what it's like to be content with life, but so many others do and persevere through the bullshit under worse circumstances than me. The reality is, as nobody has ever disproved it to me, is that you hustle and suffer through college, internships, and extracurriculars, just for the chance of a tolerable job and retirement plan. First world problems and all that, but I can't envision living like that. I'd rather not live at all.

I’m pretty torn between the schools because they both appeal to me quite a lot and I would love to be at either one. Im hoping I can get some advice from this sub on which I should choose. Here are some info I’ve gathered to help me make a decision. Still very unsure tho haha

__Cost__

Im a Washington state resident, so the first big plus for UW is a cheaper cost. *I got good aid at both schools but UW’s total cost for 1 year is 5x less for me than 1 year for USC.* However I also understand that USC’s amenities, resources, networking, etc make up for that at least partially. *This factor is important, but my family is able to pay off my college at either school. It’ll just change how much I have left over for med school depending on where I go*

__Location__

Their locations are super different but also similar. Both are in cities, but UW is obviously in cold / rainy Seattle while USC is in sunny LA. Both are also in the city and big campuses. UW’s campus is gorgeous and from what I’ve seen so is USC’s. 

__Research/Internships/Volunteering__

Both UW and USC have excellent resources for research and internships of all kind. I think UW has an edge because of access to UW med which is top notch and also lots of biotech companies based in Seattle. However there is a shit ton of resources in LA too.

__Academics__

USC is more academically prestigious than UW. From what I’ve heard the teachers are very good at both schools but USC has a better faculty overall.
USC has this over UW: 
- smaller class sizes than UW
- direct admit to my major 
- less grade deflation than UW

Pluses for both is that students aren’t overly cutthroat and competitive even in premed.

__Housing__

Both are expensive asf. UW’s dorms can be kind of hit or miss while USC has more consistently good housing. Although some dorms dont have AC apparently which sucks when you’re in California.

__Final Thoughts__

I know it would be more familiar for me to go to UW since I know seattle and I’d have friends going with me, but I also think it could be good to live somewhere else and experience that.

I know I have a tough decision ahead of me. If anyone has info about USC, UW, or both I’m all ears! Thank you :)",college,USC or UW?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mk72np/usc_or_uw/,1617595334.0

My mental health is in shambles, I stress things too much and I get so anxious and depressed about things which probably isnt good.

I just checked my computer science midterm(i wanna major in cs) and I got a fucking 54 which I kinda expected since I literally froze looking at the midterm like it was literally OPEN BOOK but the programming questions had me really confused and I needed more time. I thought I was supposed to love cs and do great in it but ig not. Currently have a C from an A now after trying my best to keep up in that class. All this pain for a C man...

I also suck at calculus and got an unbelievably low grade for my midterm(i dont even wanna say it) and I literally do not understand the material. Had some stuff going on at the beginning of the semester(I still am) and basically had a bad start with all my classes so calculus I especially missed out on foundation. How tf am I even gonna do cs if I cant do calculus right.

Also I hate writing and two of my classes require writing so yeah... Even writing 500 words is so difficult because i get distracted too much and write slow(but i type fast, its just I think too much). Everyone says that ""its so easy bro, stop complaining i could write that in 5 minutes LMAO"" and I try my hardest but no. Dont even get me started with 1000+ word essays and research papers (academic reading kills me too). I can write a 500 word reddit post but not these 2 essays i have due tomorrow FUCK ME.

Its like i dont even belong here(and yes I know impostor syndrome is bad but knowing about it doesnt really help me not feel like an impostor sadly). Also, Im a middle class minority in this school with a bunch of rich students(my school is VERY expensive, only got here from scholarship thats meant to help minorities, if that matters). I dont really open up like this to people I know because its always just the same thing and I especially dont tell any of my family.

Maybe no one cares but I just needed to say this because god damn, I dont even know why I bother trying to do this shit. Im only a freshman and im fucking complaining already. Zoom university is fun.

I posted this as a comment on FAFSA questions too, but I don't think it really fits there.

Background: Undergraduate Student on the (Western Undergraduate Exchange Program) from Colorado To Washington. I am trying to do a single Summer course this year, but they tell me my FAFSA and fee waiver would not apply to this single course. 

I am an Anthropology major looking to take a single general education course (Fundamentals of Biology/Introduction to Biology 101). I will have to maintain my on-campus apartment for the Summer, there is no possible way for me to go back 'home' to try to find a community college or something back there in order to take this course. It's a low-level Biology course, 101, that is ALWAYS filled for any other semester.

**I was wondering if any of you had advice regarding trying to take a single online course somewhere for Biology.** According to my school currently, ""In summer, the tuition rate for non-resident undergraduates is around $400 a credit. A 5-credit course would be close to $2100"" This is super expensive, as I am a single person with zero family contribution. In my area, I am on the fee-waiver and are therefore not a resident, and no local community college is actually going to have a lower cost/be anywhere near my town. Not ideal. 

Thank you for your help in advance, just a single college student tryin' to get by. :)",college,Help! Need to find an online General Education Course :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/min1ob/help_need_to_find_an_online_general_education/,1617396547.0

Hi. HS senior and I’m at an utter lost deciding where to go to college. 

I’m from NY, and while I got into NY state schools, WILL end up being cheaper than any state school. I also just really want to get out of NY. It might sound like i just wanted to go to a big party school, but that’s not it. I wanted a big school from the get go, and private schools are way too expensive. I’m also basing my decisions off of what schools are DEFINITELY having in-person classes next year. NO WAY I’m going online. Also; all three of these schools have club swimming.

Texas Tech — was supposed to be a “discount” TAMU. I got into TAMU, but they gave me dog poopoo financial aid. I’d most likely study chemical engineering, comp sci minor maybe. Got in state tuition and ended up being around 17K (with air fare and such). Good engineering school, I’d also be psyched about going to Texas. The school doesn’t have the best reputation, but a good alumni network, and my field of engineering is pretty much centered in TX.

U of South Carolina — applied here for fun, beautiful campus. Got into the Capstone program. End up being around 26k. I think UofSC has a better overall reputation, but I’m not sure if their engineering schools is AS good. I’d also be psyched about going to South Carolina. Also be studying chemE.

WVU — I know some people who go here and they really love it, one of which is an engineer. WV is a beautiful state, and the final price would be around 21k here. I’d also have the option to be in a 5 yr dual bachelor degree program of mining/Civil engineering, which seems like a really cool field to me. Some cons are that the school’s grad rate isn’t that high (the others aren’t much higher) and it has a huge party vibe, almost to a point where it has a negative affect on the school’s rep (same with the others maybe?). I’m also not sure if I’d like to live in WV either.

Anyways. I’d graduate with 10k in student loans anywhere I go. Please give any insight.",college,"Can you give me advice on picking a college (Texas tech, WVU, or U of South Carolina)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mi8w6s/can_you_give_me_advice_on_picking_a_college_texas/,1617341174.0

161,LoneBassClarinet,1617069765,/r/college/comments/mg5chk/should_i_retake_the_physics_course_that_i_got_a_c/,"I guess for a bit of pretense I should say that I started out college as a Music Education major, but at the end of my Freshman year (so the start of the pandemic when all classes were moved online) I realized that a Music Ed major wasn't for me. Seeing as my second option besides Music Ed was Physics and Astronomy Education, I decided to switch my major to that since I already had some of the education requirements completed. Fast forward to the present day, I've since realized that the Music major wasn't the only problem. It was also the Education part as well so now I'm pursuing only the Astronomy part of the major (still has physics, but I just take Astrophysics classes instead of something like Quantum Mechanics or Electronics). Oh, and I'm also pursuing minors in German and Music btw.

Okay, so during the fall semester of my Sophomore year (so last semester) I had taken Phys-141: Newtonian Mechanics, but due to how the college I attend (Valparaiso University) did things last semester, I ended up not doing too well in a few of my classes. Particularly, I failed my German course since we were moved home again at the end of the semester and I couldn't take the final or get in contact with the professor due to technology/WiFi issues, but I digress from the point of this post. The only class that I'm worried about is Phys-141 and the fact that I ended up with a C- in the course, since I had taken on too much that semester (20 credit hours lol, so oof).

The two main options that I can see for myself after graduation with a Degree in Astrophysics is to either: 

Option A - Go to Graduate School somewhere. I've heard that grades in lower-level courses don't matter all too much when it comes to applying to graduate school and the only ones that really matter are the more ""field of study"" oriented courses. Is this actually the case, or should I retake Phys-141 next Fall and try to get an 'A' in the course? Or should I not worry about it too much as it wouldn't really affect my overall GPA anyway?

Option B - Go into an armed force (most likely the Navy) and apply what Physics/Astronomy I know to the job I would be looking to get there. I've read on the Navy job-list site that the job I would potentially be applying for has a hard requirement of both a competitive GPA and a minimum of a 'B' in all relevant courses. I guess this means I already have the answer to my own question for this one, though, in that I should just retake the course to get a better grade. However, if this isn't a hard requirement to have a 'B' in all relevant courses, and that there would some leeway in the application process, would I actually need a better grade in the course?

Either way, I'm probably going to retake the course to have some extra mandatory practice to get back into the swing of physics since I'm only taking General-Education and minor courses this semester. This means that I would be doing every course required for the major within only four semesters (Junior and Senior year) to graduate on time since Valpo is way too hecking expensive to attend for more than four years. I am also going to be taking Calculus II online over the summer to catch up on the math prerequisites so I can take Calc III next fall to get it out of the way.

I would like to hear any thoughts, comments, and concerns on this matter though. If anyone has any, that is. It would be greatly appreciated, so thanks in advance.",college,Should I retake the physics course that I got a C- in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/mg5chk/should_i_retake_the_physics_course_that_i_got_a_c/,1617087765.0
162,iShouldHaveBeenAbort,1617037800,/r/college/comments/mfua6q/undergrad_in_philippine_university_or_california/,"A few months ago I left the US during the pandemic to come to the Philippines to live with my grandmother. It was a win in certain aspects: I was trying to get out of a toxic household, escape homelessness with my mom about to kick me out, and I’d be able to keep my grandmother (i call mama, who i love dearly and has raised me as her child) company and have access to the privilege of three meals a day. 
I graduated high school in 2019 and was accepted into my top colleges there including UCLA &amp; UCI. However, I was very close to not being able to graduate on time as I started to fall apart in some ways, got pulled out during my senior year of high school due to personal reasons and ended up in hospitals and treatment. I ended up having to take a gap year and spent the last two years in and out of treatment. I’m not doing that great now but I’m grateful to be in a much more manageable place but I think it’s mainly due to the fact that I’m out of the environment that made living so hellish. 
COLLEGE has been a huge thing weighing on my mind and I’ve felt like a failure and disappointment being so “late” to start. And I’m scared I might have to delay it another year but I’m trying my best to get it started this coming fall because my mama really wants to see me graduate before she passes. And I want her to see me accomplish that, too. 

My best options for college currently are going back to California for community college or enrolling at University of San Carlos in Cebu.

Admitting directly into my “dream” schools isn’t really an option anymore. I was completely a mess and ended up not even deferring my admission to the schools I worried SO much about not being accepted to and even paid the fees for my intent to register. And that SUCKS ASS because the opportunity to get my education going AND DORM to live away from my immediate family was right in front of me. But of course I also can’t afford it, fear debt and loans, &amp; probably don’t want to risk paying all THAT only to have to drop out because of my inability to handle the load as a full time student and juggle an annoyingly debilitating condition. So, community college would probably be my best option as it’d be significantly cheaper and I can eventually transfer. However, housing would be a huge issue. Cost of living is crazy expensive and it makes me wanna cry honestly lol.
By staying in the Philippines I wouldn’t have to worry about housing and other expenses. But I would have far less access to the resources and treatment I need. I try my best to stay at a functioning level but worry for when I struggle. I’m also concerned about how my degree or credits would transfer to the US or when I try to obtain a job. I often hear a community college education from the US is better than the universities here. 

I’ve honestly been so confused on what to do. I can’t afford to delay my decisions feeling paralyzed and try to avoid this even longer. I want to get my education going. Should I stay or should I go? Stay in the Philippines with an education system I’m really unsure about with a degree in a major (Psychology) that would probably get me nowhere here or do I return to the US for community college but struggle with housing and that cost of living? 

I feel like I’m missing a lot more details I was meaning to include but I’m honestly tired.

For some context, I attended and are still attending an Indian art/multimedia school (which has a branch in my country) I signed up for back in 2018. It was the easy but expensive choice, as I was too damn dumb to even dream of being admitted to state colleges. So off I went with my decision.

It consists of 4 semesters (for my Advanced Diploma): Graphics Design, Web UI/UX, Cinematography and 3D Animation. Here is my problem: I fucking hate Web UI/UX with a passion. While I've already done Graphic Design and can't wait until I transitioned to Cinematography and 3D Animation - because those are actually the reasons why I signed up for this school. 

I'll admit, I'm terrible at coding/programming ever since I was a 13, my dad ever had an IT dude came over and did all the homework for me because I was too dumb to figure it out. Programming was never my forte, I can't imagine myself using HTML and CSS when I couldn't and still can't even code 1 line of Pascal. And now it's been two years of me stuggling to pass the second semester. I couldn't get myself to understand UI/UX no matter how hard I tried and had to retake most if not all the courses and still couldn't pass most of them. Out of 11 courses I have only complete one and it tooks me 2 takes to get it right...FOR TWO YEARS, jesus how stupid can I be? I feel like an ancient ape walking amongst a civilized society. I can't understand, why it's always like this? I'm always that one helpless child that got lost behind.

With that amount of time people who used to study at the same rate as I did in the first Semester, they had already complete 4 semester and on their way getting their diploma already(because a semester is only 6 months). WHILE I'M STUCK HERE FOR 2 YEARS JUST BECAUSE OF SOME CODES.

What should I do? Keep on trying or just give up at this point (I'm half my foot into that hole already). I've the option, the option to skip this shit entirely and move on to the next semester, right now. But then I will never get my Advanced Diploma in Multimedia if I haven't complete all the courses.

Cons:

\- Might not be compatible/fighting living with a stranger

\- Worried especially during COVID about them having people over or just generally not being careful

\- I can still afford it but at the higher end of my budget

\- Safety (single female)

I badly want to stop college while this health hazard stays and keeps students off campus. I’m barely learning anything at all, yet still paying for the expensive tuition. But I’m also afraid of falling behind. I’ve already done so and it costed me a year, doing it again would cost me another and god knows most professors here don’t treat students who fall behind that well. I also don’t want to be left behind by my friends for that long; I am afraid that staying in school for long while they are in the workforce would make keeping in contact difficult.

173,Qwerkyjuan,1611812147,/r/college/comments/l6p5au/fired_from_my_interior_design_internship_any/,"I’m a senior studying Interior Design. Due to COVID, I have had to do my planned summer internship (required to graduate) throughout my senior year. 

I started out in the fall semester with a nice lady I emailed asking if she was looking for an intern. She interviewed me and although I was pretty nervous, took me on as her first intern. Being an interior design major, I told her I knew how to use SketchUp, Revit, and AutoCAD with what I’ve learned through college. A lot of it is self-taught, trial and error.

From the beginning we had issues with communication. I started ignoring the due dates listed on Asana because they were never accurate. The first time I messed up, was when I worked from home and delayed a project of hers because this time she put a due date on Asana and actually meant it. I obviously apologized and said that was my mistake. 

But I’ve also felt that she asked a lot from me in some assignments. Sure, I can use sketchup to model an office, but I’ll have to google how to place a certain tile into the project. She basically has given me tasks that she can’t possibly complete herself. She typically hires a separate designer who is a professional when it comes to sketchup, so he’s quick, but also expensive. So even if I take hours to figure something out, it’ll still cost her less to use me. 

Anyway, I was fired today through text because she said I was unreliable. I wrote her an email a week ago telling her I was willing to work hard for her and put her needs first (ahead of the rest of my collegiate academics and athletics) this semester if she would have me back. I was willing to work especially on Wednesdays and Fridays when I had the most free time. She said that her conditions were that she would give me a deadline for a project, I would have to let her know if I believed I could complete it within that time, and then keep my word.

And it worked well for the first week, although I already started falling behind on the rest of my academics because she kept adding on to the assignment.

But apparently yesterday she sent me an email with the assignment for today. I swear to you, when I checked my work email yesterday, I did not see that email. I assumed maybe she would give me the assignment today. 

So when I got the text that I was fired, I panicked and called her immediately asking if she was sure she sent the assignment. Lo and behold it was in my email. Then she told me that she was just so disappointed not hearing from me because she also texted me! But I didn’t notice the text either? So I checked my phone and realized that she texted me while I was having a phone conversation with another college about grad school. So somehow I just messed up again. 

Of course this was all an accident. I desperately need the college credit. But for her, it was just too many strikes. So now I’m just wondering if this will be an issue for my future. I’ve never failed this badly in anything before. In my academic career I’ve always been at the top of the class. In athletics I’ve always been one of the most dedicated. So this is such a weird experience for me to have messed up so badly, precisely when I knew everything was on the line. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? This is my last semester until I graduate (if I find another internship soon!!!) and it’s already such a stressful, high pressure situation for me. I just feel horribly that this internship, which I was extremely excited for in the Fall, has ended because I made too many mistakes.",college,"Fired from my Interior Design Internship, any Advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l6p5au/fired_from_my_interior_design_internship_any/,1611830147.0

The city Chapel Hill is super close to me and happens to be where UNC is, a great college that is competitive and also very affordable being a public in-state school. UNC is one of my top options if I get in (I am hopeful) but there is a dilemma I am now facing.

I love my family and this town, but I kinda want to get out. UNC is literally like 15 minutes from me, and while I would most likely be dorming/living on campus which would be new, I’d still be really close to home.

I have applied to other schools like UGA and Tulane. I got deferred from Tulane, and even if I get in it would probably be too expensive. I got into UGA and the idea of going somewhere completely new is super exciting, but I feel like it would be dumb of me to go away to a school that is more expensive being out of state and arguably an easier school to get into (not a diss: UGA is an AWESOME school but UNC’s acceptance rate is considerably lower).

Any advice here? If I get into UNC, that would be quite cheaper and probably better but I won’t be going far at all.

183,Alviv1945,1608238906,/r/college/comments/kf66lo/uni_changed_roommate_rules_between_semesters_help/,"Hey Reddit!  
This issue is a bit on the strange side, and it's not a direct issue with my roommate, but moreso the school and last-minute changes involving roommates. It takes some explanation but I will add a TL:DR at the bottom.  
Note that this is for a university in the state of Washington (but I won't list the specific school as I'm not sure what the consequences would be).  
Currently a Freshman. 

**Background:**  
Early July I was in a car accident that had me in a boot for five months. I couldn't walk properly and needed a lot of help getting around and accessing things. I also have pretty severe anxiety. At the same time, my roommate has some mental health issues that are better handled when not alone. As of our application for the Fall Semester, the school was allowing some exceptions for roommates, however, most people were placed into single dorms due to COVID. We both agreed that not having a roommate or someone around would be detrimental to our health, and accepted the terms that should either of us get COVID, we would both quarantine. We also either dined in the provided spaces in the dining hall or in our rooms to prevent further spread. If we hung out with friends outside of our dorms, we took all precautions not to get each other sick (which was good, because I'm immunocompromised). We only ever visited our dorm supervisor and one other friend a couple of floors down, but even then it was 6ft/2m away in the hall. Neither of us got COVID for the entirety of the semester, and our campus peaked at 14 (I think) cases for the entire semester despite plenty of parties taking place on other floors (none of which we attended).  


My roommate is genuinely awesome too. Personal issues aside, we'd figured out a cleaning schedule for the room within 3 days, and became very dependent on each other. We both have issues remembering to eat/sleep/take care of ourselves, but we can take advantage of that fun anxiety loophole where we feel the urge to remind the other to do those things. We have an established schedule where I leave to go study in the library/shower during her therapy sessions, and we both watch our fav show on Thursdays on the TV. On top of that, we share a LOT of things, including but not limited to:  
\-TV  
\-Scent diffusers/air fresheners  
\-Nintendo Switch  
\-Humidifier  
\-Curtains  
\-Rug  
\-Clothes drying rack  
\-Mirror  
\-Watering can for plants  
\-Heating pads for ladies week  
\-Microwave splash screen  
\-Cleaning supplies  
\-Trash bags  
\-Milk, cheese, veggies, candy, most leftovers  
\-Study supplies

As of yesterday, my roommate called the housing department to get specifics on how moving back in would work. We had flights back into the state planned for the same day, planned to share an uber/lyft, and help each other with luggage and she wanted to make sure we didn't mess anything up.   
Later she calls me crying upon being told that everyone was now being moved to single dorms upon the Dean's request. The Housing Department doesn't like this decision and is trying to fight it, but if that fight is lost, that puts us (and the few others who have roommates for similar reasons) in a really bad position. One of us will be required to move down the hall, which for either of us includes several lbs of books, sheets, shelving units, clothes, luggage, shoes, and those major shared items that we own (me owning the TV, Curtians, Air Fresheners, Rug, Drying Rack, Cleaning Supplies and most Study Supplies, leaving her needing to purchase those) while I'm still doing intense physical therapy for my leg/foot. On top of that, either one of us frequently forgets keys and tends to sit outside for 30+ minutes out of fear of interrupting a class. I also don't know if either of us can afford a single dorm (if the school is changing rooming prices).  
Oh, and also, my folks won't even let me go back to campus without a roommate. 

I want to be able to have a somewhat normal and healthy college experience. I respect the precautions the school is taking against COVID, but with our previous arrangement, neither of us ever got it and if anything we were better holding each other accountable for both being aware of COVID and for other things- like eating, sleeping, starting class/studying, getting out of our pajamas, etc. This change feels super last minute, as the official email from the school was only sent out today and we had to plan way in advance to afford flights into the state and appointments to get COVID tests within a reasonable time before our arrival. When we signed up to have a roommate, we both signed a roommate agreement and were under the impression that things would remain this way for the entirety of the school year, as we were worried about having to move rooms in the first place. As far as I understand, the CDC isn't requiring or even recommending students to be strictly single dormed anyway... I'm just very confused and shaken up. 

Parents on both ends have tried calling in and were promised calls from housing withing 24 hours (they're all upset as well). No one has called back and it's getting close to the employee's winter break.  


**TL:DR**  
Beginning of school year, roommate and I were one of a few pairs permitted to room together due to COVID. We needed roommates due to physical and mental health issues in which being alone would be detrimental to our health. We were told that we wouldn't have to worry about later changing rooms. We both share 15+ major expensive items and those mental health issues are still prevalent. W  
We agreed to quarantine if one of us got COVID and hold each other responsible for COVID related health precautions. We've both developed a good relationship and depend on each other for a lot, and we feel like the other is the only normalcy we have left. We both had to sign up for appointments for COVID testing and flights back into Washington weeks in advance to afford them/have them at reasonable times.   
As of today, the school has officially stated that all students are being moved into single dorms, despite the state not requiring it. Neither of us can afford that and my own parents will not allow me to return to the school without a roommate. I feel my own mental health would suffer if I went back, and I'd also struggle to move everything to another room with the still persisting injury to my foot.   
Both sets of parents and ourselves have tried contacting the school for specifics or alternatives or at least to put in our two cents. We were promised calls back within 24 hours... and have yet to receive any calls. 

Can the school do this? Is there anywhere in WA law that states they can't, as we've already signed our roommate agreement and were given verbal confirmation that we would not have to move rooms previously? Does anyone have any advice?

184,andizzyg,1608146140,/r/college/comments/kefppd/how_to_make_in_college_2020/," ***How to make $ in college*** 

**#1: Use your skills.** There are tons of people who want to learn something that you know how to do. And they are willing to invest some cash to learn something new. Use this to your advantage. Whether that’s being a coach, painting instructor, guitar lessons, whatever you are good at. Give it a try and it's great because work will revolve around your schedule. Plus you won’t have a boss to tell you what to do all the time. A way that you can get started in using your skills to your advantage is by making flyers and putting them in the places that relate to your skill and by posting on your social media that you are starting to give lessons and if anyone may be interested in. It is a good start and your clientele will only increase over time. And given that there’s low-key a pandemic going on… perhaps just try your lessons over Zoom and charge less. 

**#2: Become a tutor, TA, or use a Work-Study job**. This will not only get you a check but it will also help you relearn important topics covered that will help you out on any standardized tests that you may need to take. and when you aren’t busy you are able to do work on your own Homework. It’s a win-win situation. Just try and apply for the job and it's great because your employers will understand that you are in school and will help you prioritize your school work and can be flexible with your work schedule.

**#3: Sell your shit**\- That piece of jewelry that you bought 2 years ago and have only worn once is not a necessity. Use Apps like eBay, letgo, Goat. One man's trash is another man's treasure. There probably a whole variety of things that you own but you don’t use any more. So remove your emotional attachment to that one thing that you actually forgot about and never use and please sell it. 

**#4: Become an RA.** Most people pay to stay in the dorms. You are getting paid to have a room by yourself, close to campus with the only drawback being the slight responsibility. However, college students are adults and most are smart enough to not do something that stupid in the dorm setting. Instead of paying for rent, get paid for rent. 

**#5. Sell Class notes.** If you have taken a class that is notoriously tough for many students. I would suggest gathering all the notes that you have taken throughout the semester and making them in pdf of some sort and sell the flash drives to students who are willing to pay. You can promote these notes by making flyers and using social media. You’d be surprised how many people would find value in this so if you are good at taking notes…why not make a profit off it?

**#6. Be a Designated Driver.** The truth is that it could be hard to find a friend to be the DD and sometimes your “DD” ends up drinking more than you do. Also, Uber’s could really get expensive and we college kids are broke. So if you decrease your fee as a DD and promote your service in the university setting, you’re going to get tons of business. Just make sure to keep a trash can in your car with snacks. 

**#7. Uber Driver.** Now if you don’t want to go the independent DD route, you could just become an Uber driver as you set your own hours and can work whenever you please. The good thing about this is that Uber is quite established so people would probably be more likely to trust it. People will always need transportation and if you have a car that’s halfway decent then use it to your advantage. 

**#8: Do Cheap Haircuts.** Haircuts could be expensive. I myself spend around $25 every 3 weeks on a haircut. If you can offer the same or similar quality of haircut and perhaps decrease your charge, I almost guarantee you’re going to receive clients. However, your work has to be quality because your barber can really decide how fresh you looking in front of the ladies you know. All you need is some clippers with various clipper guards and scissors. But please sanitize your blades…

**#9: Dog sitting.** If you are obsessed with dogos .. then this is the gig for you. There's an app called Rover and you basically just take people's dogs for walks and just take care of them. This shouldn’t even be a job because I would honestly pay the owner to hang out with their dog. Definitely look into it if you’re interested.  

**#10: Vector Marketing.** I used to have this job and it's basically just trying to sell Cutlery to people you know and whether you sell anything or not you get a base pay of like $16 per appointment. It’s totally all on your own time. I worked a total of 15 hours and earned $230. So it wasn’t bad at all. 

**#11: Facebook ads**. Perhaps you guys have heard of this but Facebook ads are basically you reaching out to a business to promote them using Facebook or Instagram. If they accept, you will receive a certain percentage of sales, or whatever their terms are. A lot of businesses are struggling right now and are trying to adapt to stay afloat but simply don’t have the knowledge, resources, or workforce to help them. It is very much like the evolutionary quote “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most **adaptable** to change.” So if you can help these businesses adapt to the current change, they will defiantly be offering you a pretty penny in return. 

**#12: Dropshipping.** Okay, I'm going to make this simple. You buy a product cheaply from a wholesaler and sell it for a higher price and you pocket the difference. But your quality of the product may suffer along with shipping time to the customer. This could result in refunds. 

**#13: E-Commerce (Amazon).** Similar concept as Dropshipping except you receive your customers products in advance and you are more in control of the shipping time period along with the quality of the product. If you do this over many products, you are going to start making some good monthly income. 

**#14: Investing in stocks** (Give run down on stocks). Okay so investing in the stock market may seem like gambling to some and honestly let those people think that. The stock market is very predictable once you start comprehending trend patterns but the biggest mistake many investors make is that they don’t do their research so they end up losing. Now you don’t have to be a full-on day trader to make some decent money in the stock market. If you do some initial research on a certain company or business and their overall trend pattern has been increasing then the stock may be solid. Defiantly look for stocks that are reaching higher highs and higher lows. I’ll leave some links in the description box below that are helpful videos to get an idea as to what the stock market is and some things that you should know before investing. Now you may lose some money as you ride the roller coaster but you will not only make it up but will double your money in the long run. I won’t get too much into stocks cuz there is quite a bit to know before you start investing but a good introduction is using something like Robin Hood or Acorns to slightly invest your money as you use spare change to invest money with. Just to clarify I am not a stock market specialist, I am just advocating that stocks can be very profitable and can be a solid means of income for you but invest at your own risk.

**#15: Youtube.** Now, this will be quite sometime before you’ll be making some good money with this but once you hit that 50k subs, your Channel will really start to grow and gain you some passive income. Plus it's just fun af.

185,ea0995,1607995762,/r/college/comments/kdbo8f/things_for_high_school_seniors_to_consider/,"Hi All,  
I am now 2 years removed from graduating college and I just wanted to let any 17-18 year olds looking for colleges things to consider  that I wish I could've thought about when I was your age. 

1.) Don't take out loans for the college experience / its okay to go close to home - 

Im not saying loans are bad. You should take out the loans you need for school, I emphasize 'for school'. I lived about 15 minutes away from a really good college with a highly recognized Engineering school, instead I went to an out of state school about an hour away that is just as recognized in Engineering as the in-state school. I enjoyed my time at the out of state school, but I ended up with about 30k in loans (which isnt that bad) while friends I had in the in-state school escaped with about 15k in loans. I would've probably gotten the same job at the same pay regardless of either school I would've gone to, so I could've saved 15k.  Most of the loans were just to live on campus and get the college experience because I didn't want to be so close to home. Trust me, a social life is not worth the loans if you can get a similar social life elsewhere for the same education. If you have a chance to go to Harvard for example, or your local state school, then that's different. Really assess your options if that is the case and see what's best for you. 

2.) Take out a credit card - 

You should ask your parents about building credit now. Have them take out a credit card in your name and let them use it for gas and pay it off every month. Or have them add you as an alternate user to a credit card they rarely use. That is if you think your parents will be responsible enough, there are also horror stories of parents messing up their kids credit. If not then take it out on your own but only use it once a month and spend like 50 bucks and pay it off by the end of the month. Your student loans will give you credit history but if you plan to pay those off quickly then it gets erased from your credit score once its paid off. Im not 100% sure but I think your credit score could go down for paying off your oldest account (its stupid, but that is the way it works). If you have a credit card as old as your oldest student loan, then your credit score won't be affected as much because your credit history is based off your oldest active account. My oldest accounts are my student loans and I didn't get another account till I graduated. So if I pay off my student loans early my history will drop 4 years. Even if you don't use the credit card you should never let credit cards close, because the more money you have in credit cards (the max amount in the credit card) and the less you use the higher your score gets. It's always good to use less than 10% of the credit card, keep it below 5% just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) apply to scholarships even throughout your years in college -   
Scholarships are still given out even if you have been in college for years. Don't stop applying just because you are already in college. Colleges tend to have programs where alumni donate a certain amount to be used as a scholarship. There are scholarships for people online. If you can avoid getting more loans, you should do it. 

4.) you can start at a community college -  
community college doesnt get the credit it deserves. My parents/uncles/aunts saw it as an embarrasment to have me or my cousins go to a community college. If you want to save money and you think you can still graduate in 4 years assuming you get good grades, then go for community college for you first year to get general eds out the way. Check if there is a community college that works closely with a state university to transfer credits easily, usually if you get good grades you can get all your credits transferred if the CC and university have a good transfer program. If you only got accepted to one school but the school is too expensive or they are not giving you enough financial aid, go to community college for a semester or two, get your grades up and you can transfer to a 4 year school even if they rejected you in high school. It's easier to transfer to a school if you have good grades than it is to apply out of college. I get it's not the easy way out but it can save you a ton of money.

5.) College isn't for everyone / there are other options -  
this is for kids who may be in school because of their parents and may not like being in school. This does not apply to me but I do have relatives who went to school only because their parents slammed it into their heads and they didn't dare to tell their parents they didn't want to go. I also knew a few kids who went for the same reason and ended up dropping out. The relatives who didn't want to go stayed for at most a year and have student loans that they never wanted. Trade school (plumbing, electricity, etc) gets disrespected nowadays because nobody wants their kid to be a plumber. Even though you may have to work harder to make good money, there will always be a need for plumbing and other trades. There's no shame in it if you really work hard. You can even get in to real estate or maybe if you're really street smart and dedicated you can work hard at investing in stocks or real estate. It may take years and alot of luck for you to get good money in houses/stocks but it's been done before. Assuming you put in the necessary work. It's not easy and will take alot of learning and failing and you may never get good money but at least you tried. I wish me and my relatives knew of these different options, I would probably had still gone to school still but maybe my relatives would have gotten a good certificate and gotten better jobs. We were basically told its school or working at a factory. You can also sign up for the military if you like it and decide to go to school after your contract is up, which they pay.",college,Things for high school seniors to consider.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/kdbo8f/things_for_high_school_seniors_to_consider/,1608013762.0
186,FioreFee,1607893539,/r/college/comments/kcis8y/i_need_advice_on_whether_or_not_i_should_transfer/,"I’m currently a sophomore trying to study computer science at a private institution where tuition increases by at least $2,000 each year. I’ve already taken out a federal subsidized loan of $4,500 and I know it’ll keep accumulating the longer I go here, so I need advice. 

To be honest, my school isn’t as great as I thought it would be when I first started studying here. I thought since the first year was bearable in cost, I could continue. I realized the longer I stay here though, the more debt I’ll accumulate for a mediocre education, so I thought: Should I just transfer?

Another thing to take into account is that my school technically doesn’t offer computer science as a major. They have this dual-degree program where I can study at another university they’ve partnered with, so it would take 5 years to get a degree instead of the usual 4. This makes things complicated because I don’t know how federal aid will work for that 5th year and my college advisors aren’t being that transparent with the information either. This feels extremely risky since the other university is much more expensive than mine, and I don’t think it would be worth it.

Instead, I’m thinking about transferring to a state school next semester/year (haven’t made up my mind yet). I’m not sure if it’ll be too late or if it would be even costlier for me since lots of the courses I’ve taken already are non-transferable or just don’t go with my major. I know for sure this state school offers computer science without me having to do any weird degree programs, but is it too late to transfer? 

TLDR; Private college is getting expensive and I don’t know if I want to continue studying here. Should I transfer to an affordable state school despite the time and money I’ve wasted at my current school? 

Hope this makes sense.

187,eccentricgalaxy,1606968597,/r/college/comments/k5q1h3/should_i_go_to_campus_in_the_spring/,"Hi everyone, I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe.

Today, my college has announced that they are giving us a week to decide whether we would like to go on-campus for the first time or continue to study remotely.  Although more details are suppose to release tomorrow, they have told us so far that all courses will still remain online.

If I'm being truly honest, I have wanted to go on-campus for so, so long.  However, at the same time, I am definitely concerned about being the person that will cause a massive outbreak.  I definitely don't want others to get coronavirus, and I have a huge fear that if I go and I get corona, I'll give it to all my classmates.

My two choices are:

1. Stay Home

* \+I get to spend more time with my family, which is absolutely awesome.
* \+My family and I will save money by not paying room and board.
* \+I love bike riding, and I can do that at home.
* \-Although I absolutely love my family, and I know I'll miss them, I've been yearning for a college experience for a really long time and am super excited, particularly because I haven't seen anyone outside my family since March for the most part.
* \-I haven't had many opportunities to connect with my classmates online.
* \-I've never had an opportunity to go to my college's campus, so I'm super excited for the chance to go.  If I decide not to go, I may not be able to be on-campus again till August 2021.

2. Go On-Campus

* \+It will be a lot of fun to have the chance to connect with my classmates, especially because so far, the majority of my classmates seem to be going on-campus.
* \+It's super exciting that this will be my first time on campus and getting to explore the community.
* \+I have an odd feeling that I might be more motivated around other students taking courses with me, although I'm not sure if my assumption would be wrong.
* \+Since classes are all online, I don't think there's too much of a chance that a high exposure will break out at my college.
* \+Students who I know who currently live on campus told me that the school has been safe and doing things really well.
* \-Will be more expensive as I'll pay room and board.
* \-I can't bring my bike with me, so I'll either have to buy a new bike at my college or decide not to bike at all.
* \-Since classes are online completely, my experience in terms of classes would be the same at home and on campus.
* \-I am definitely concerned about being the person that will cause a massive outbreak.  I definitely don't want others to get coronavirus, and I have a huge fear that if I go, I'll give COVID to all my classmates.

Thank you all so much for the time and advice.  I truly appreciate it.

188,Leopars56,1606871922,/r/college/comments/k4yxeh/this_semester_grades_handling_of_covid_effects_on/,"So I'm currently a sophomore attending a very rigorous, top 25 US university. Basically, I had found myself going down a dark path when COVID/Lockdowns first started. As I am sure it did to most, being in a lockdown/isolated from the normal life that we have all grown accustomed to really had a negative impact on my mental health. My family has a history of depression on both sides and I could not admit it to myself at the time, but I was becoming depressed. I started smoking weed everyday, multiple times per day and stayed in bed constantly. I would just smoke, go on my laptop, xbox, or phone and numb myself from the feelings I was experiencing.

Once the lockdown started to ease up in the summer, I was 20 pounds heavier (in 2 months) and disgusted with myself whenever I was sober and looked in the mirror. Without any motivation, I continued my way down this dark spiraling path.  I kept telling myself it would get better once I returned to college, but I got myself into more bad habits in the mean time. My ""friend"" became an  illegal ""online bookie"" and I would spend my days just gambling and smoking. My concept of realness would get so numbed from the constant high, that I would be irrational with my gambling and not have any concept of how much I was actually losing (these sites use credits, so there are no up front deposits needed. Just a final payout/collection at the end of the week.). This newfound gambling addiction was a way for me to create excitement in a time I felt there was not much to do.

Luckily for me my college did decide to open up in the fall, and I felt some non drug/gambling related excitement for the first time in awhile. I had just finished pledging a fraternity before COVID had impacted that semester, and could not wait to see my friends. Part of me had no confidence in some regards, as my subtle transformation to a degenerate left me feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin. I dealt with this for the beginning of the semester when I got back, but then something cool happened. I started to find motivation. I was able to workout with friends in our dorms which made it a lot more fun and we were able to hold each other accountable, and they helped me go on a t break. I had lost 10 pounds and was feeling the best I had in a long time.

But then I got Covid. I hadn't gone to a single party. We hungout in our dorms and kept low, but everyone on campus was seemingly getting it. The school threw me in a Best Western Motel for 12 days and I completely regressed back to my old ways. All I had for the next 12 days was weed I had brought (Even with the tbreak there was no way at that time I was going to get through 12 days of isolation with no weed at all. Call it dumb, but other people brought alcohol to keep them company, so to each their own) and the TV in my room. As well as the gambling that I decided to take up again, which resulted in me risking a total of $700 in those 12 days and pretty much breaking even at -$12. I was not allowed to go outside once. I had entered into that Best Western  when it was around 75-80 degrees in the beginning of October, to 60-65 when I came out, but I didnt realize the gradual shift in temperature til the day I left. 

The isolation and experience of that was horrible. I didnt have any symptoms of Covid besides a slight fever and loss of smell which I regained after a few days. These slight symptoms goes for any college student I have personally met that has contracted the disease, which is around 75-100.  The symptoms of Covid werent the bad part for me, it was the complete tear of my mental health. I came out of that isolation in the same position I had started in before college started: Depressed, addicted to pot and gambling, and overweight. 

The campus I returned to was the most restrictive place I could ever imagine. I got written up for throwing a football on the quad, and being in a 4 person hall when there were 5 people there at the time within the first few weeks. There was nothing to do and I felt completely lost about how I could turn my life around. 

This had such a huge toll on me and my habits got worse and worse. I started smoking the most I had ever in my entire life. I would wake up and get high and immediately start placing bets. I had met some guys who were big spenders and I would start to match their spending habits while I was completely fried and not involved in the reality of it all. I knew it was really getting bad when I had to call my parents for $1.3k out of my savings account. I admitted my issues gambling and they told me to get help from someone at school, but wired me the money too. I had thought that by calling them they would take me out of this place and tell me to come home. A few weeks later I was feeling so shit that I was throwing down the most expensive bets ever cause in the back of my head it was ""well, you're either gonna be making some nice money or definitely going home this time"". Obviously that was foolish and dumb, but thats the way Ive looked back and assessed my thought process during that time and my therapist agrees. 

Upon coming home, my family had been supportive and I have never felt better. Hitting a personal rock bottom has shifted my perspective on life and I can gladly say I have been seeing a therapist for the first time in my life these past 6 weeks I have been home, and I also have not bet or smoked once. I am happy to say that I also have been going to the gym 6 times a week, and have never been in better shape before. 

With this all being said (sorry for such a long post XD), how do these schools expect us students to be okay in the conditions they have set up for us? I know I am not the only one who has experienced these sort of things this semester, yet might be one of the only ones to admit these problems I have dealt with. Although I am doing great now, I really feel this whole situation is fucked and that these schools should be exposed for the non-caring businesses they truthfully are. They only care about the money we pay them regardless of the experience they provide, and for me thats 38k (76k a year!) for a 2.6 GPA (haven't even told my parents yet), deepened mental health issues, and unneeded stress. 

I guess I wanted this to be more of a place for people to share their opinions on the COVID effected semester and share their own experiences.

189,anonbutterflyrocks,1606328428,/r/college/comments/k0xkv8/how_i_won_an_academic_violation_case_and_how_you/,"**If you want to read the story that began this, I made this post in October:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor\_said\_i\_hacked\_into\_his\_computer\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor_said_i_hacked_into_his_computer_to_get/)

Hey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on an Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with an something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.

For all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry because I wished something like this would've happened to me in high school or something, not college, because they would've been able to defend me. But in college, you're pretty much all alone. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These would be the only things I would think about 24/7.

I'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.

After the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this professor, even while my case was pending.

After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient ""evidence"", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.

**So if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**

1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.
2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least.
3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and come up with any evidence that you need to defend yourself.
4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.
5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.
6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make you look guilty, you'll look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics.
7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.
8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!** NO, your life isn't over. Breathe. Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that I would be convicted of something I didn't do, and that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong.

Sorry for the long post but yeah, this is what happened. I could still sue my professor for defamation and mistreatment, but I don't think I will, because I don't care about him. It's really sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, sorry buddy, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say.

I hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost. If you're convicted of something like this and you need someone to talk to or you need advice, I'd be more than happy to help you and share some of my wise wisdom haha.

I'm Italian. I moved to California 7 years ago. When I came here I didn't know any English, so I had to enroll in adult school to learn it. I started by taking ESL classes in a community college, and since my high school diploma (I have a diploma from ""liceo classico"" - that kind of high school where you mostly study latin and greek) is not valid, I had to take several GED classes. I'm done with general education classes and right now I'm still at that community college to receive my associate degrees in medical assisting (both clinical and administrative), psychology, sociology, behavioral science, and anthropology (yes, I like to be extra), BUT only psychology is for transfer.

Now... if I transfer to a university, do I still need to take a SAT? Also, do I need to transfer right away after completion of my associate or can I wait a little? Is is true that if you transfer with an associate you only need 2 years of university left in order to obtain a bachelor? I'm 30, and I've been at school since forever!

192,enriqueg9031,1605609660,/r/college/comments/jvqwqv/im_stuck_in_a_dilemma_with_renting_an_apartment/,"Hello all,

I haven't seen this being discussed too much, but here's the dilemma:

My uni isn't making classes online anytime soon. Even when their numbers spiked earlier this semester, they doubled down on keeping school open. I'm only doing one other class right now.

So for next spring, I would have to get an apartment in order to continue my degree. Well, guess what? If I do that, and classes move online (a very likely scenario), then I'm stuck paying $1k/month for an apartment just to do online classes.

If I decide not to risk getting stuck in a lease just to do online classes, then I can only take one class (which is technically a gap semester for me). I can only do Spanish online, there's literally no other classes for me to take online after that (I'm a senior in mechanical engineering). Not only will I delay my graduation further by doing this, but I'm going to lose my stamina and possibly struggle upon returning in fall 2021. Not likely, but possible.

So to summarize, I can't decide between:

* Renting an apartment for next spring, and possibly getting sick or having my classes moved online mid-term, leaving me stuck in an expensive lease, or;
* Waiting for classes to move online at the start of the semester (taking them at my parents' house). However, they may never go online and I have to take another semester off, which may make it harder for me to get back into learning mode.

Sorry if that sounded a bit confusing, I tried to be as succinct as possible.

Now, before you ask:

*Can't you transfer to another school?* No. As much as I want to, it's not possible for me. The in-state engineering schools are not moving online anytime soon. The out-of-state schools have the same problem, plus they cost way more and my credits are less likely to transfer.

*How can your uni not offer any online option for you?* It's absurd. They have a plethora of online classes, but not a single one in my major is offered online. I guess it's like with nursing or other technical skills where you really need hands-on learning.

So thank you for reading. I could really use some advice right now.",college,I'm stuck in a dilemma with renting an apartment and online classes (advice is welcome),https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jvqwqv/im_stuck_in_a_dilemma_with_renting_an_apartment/,1605627660.0

I got some more info on the Texas [Hazlewood Act](https://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Documents/Publications/Presentation/1987_Overview_of_Hazlewood_Act_Exemption_and_Hazlewood_Legacy_Program.pdf) and would like to use at least some hours before I turn 25 and am no longer eligible. 

I’ve narrowed it down to 3 things - 

1. Air Medical Transport - not directly a degree but generally a STEM degree is required. 

Pros: I would be able to pilot, something I’ve always wanted to do. 

Cons: Almost as expensive to get your pilots license as it is to get a degree, very competitive to get a job if you’re not ex-military. 

2. Teaching (ideally junior high or elementary ages) - I was in a club in high school focused on preparing students for teaching and went all the way to nationals with a lesson plan I did. 

Pros: always a demand for teachers, somewhat good at it? 

Cons: My math grades are kinda sucky but I like math and science and that would ideally be my preferred grades to teach. Not the best at speaking to groups. 

3. Forensic Science 

Pros: again, I like science. Decent demand for it?

Cons: I’ve heard it’s competitive and again, my math grades sucked. Chemistry kinda did too. 

I just wanna get back to starting my life. I’m grateful I have a job through these times but need to get somewhere other than the hospital I’ve been at for the last 3 years.

I wasn't sure where to ask this question but I guess its related to college. I'm moving near campus in a few weeks for sophomore year and will be the only one living at my apartment there for a while. 

I don't have a driver's license (I know, I need to) and don't have a car. My school is in a pretty suburban area so most grocery stores are a decent walking distance (~45 min to an hour) away.

I'm also in California, so Uber/Lyft are both expensive and banned(?). 

Here are some options I've come up with: 
- Just sucking it up and walking
- Somehow shipping my bike over?
- Asking friends nearby for rides (no one I'm really close with will be there, and I don't want to ask for too many favors though)
- Trying grocery delivery services (instacart, etc.?)

My student loans with the government are running out CTU told me so they told me to get another loan in the next few months and pay out of pocket on a balance I have in my student acct or they will have to withdraw me. I am a first generation student with no living parents so you would think my EFC is low but it’s not. I’ve had to retake a few classes so that has eaten up aid I could have used but it’s only been a few classes. 
I’ve seen some shady stuff about this “university” charging you for even logging into campus and they fees they charge are crazy high. I think it’s sketchy how all the sudden they have used up all my government aid and grants. 
I have core credits math and such completed at another legitimate university I can transfer once I pay them off. But I think they won’t matter because I have taken these same classes at CTU. So this isn’t the only college I’ve used my aid at. 

The problem is I wasn’t aware and didn’t do my research that CTU is in trouble with the state board of education for false advertising about jobs and screwing over veterans so I can’t get a loan from another source. CTU isn’t in the options list no matter what loan service I try. They might be accredited and this and that but the college itself is on pins and needles with the department of education. 

I read they have to remain open long enough for the current students to graduate and then they will be shut down unless they do a settlement.

It was too expensive for me to continue living on campus, so I moved back home and switched to online classes for my second year.

I want to do film, but I'm not loaded, I live in hillbilly hell, and my parents think I'm stupid. What do I do??

I was supposed to go to film school in Athens, OH. That's been my plan since June 2019. My parents waited until AFTER I got accepted that winter to tell me it was too expensive. They tried to convince me to go to community college and gave me time to think about it. ""We can't technically force you to not go, [but basically you're doomed if you choose OU.]"" Even with the scholarships I got.

I did some research and chose not to go to college at all. My plan was to work a normal job until I could get an internship or something, get my foot into the door for any job opportunities in film. Film degrees are useless, start as a PA, etc. They essentially said ""okay."" and that was the end of it for a while. 

Then comes July, and my mom tells me I need a backup plan. Because I won't be able to support myself or some shit. She convinces me to go for x-ray technologist at the community college. My aunt did that, makes good money. I say fine. I apply- the program is closed. She tries to get me to waste two extra years taking shit classes so that my in-state scholarship (PROMISE) will cover everything for 4 years. I have to go for Something this year in order for the scholarship to be used. I say fuck no, I'm not spending more time in college for something I have no plans of doing for the next 30 years. I change my major last minute to culinary arts.

I like culinary. It's fun, I'm a good cook, I would be fine working in a restaurant until I can go Elsewhere. I live in BFE, I need to save before I can just head to NY or CA or somewhere with film opportunities. Culinary is fine. 

I get a job in the college town. Moving into apartment here within the next month.

Also you missed orientation. Also, the classes are at THE OTHER CAMPUS, an hour away. Also, I can't fucking drive and the DMV is booked beyond October due to COVID.

I'm moving even further away from the college I'm essentially being forced to go to. I thought I was gonna be within walking distance. Mom is trying to blame me for every inconvenience when this all could have been sorted before I even graduated in May, if she hadn't been so busy manipulating me.

So I'm going to have to get a ride from my mom to class every day, at least for whatever isn't online. She's pissed abt that. I'm pissed that my cashed out college fund is now gonna be used for college rather than a safety net. Sure, not all of it, but every little bit helps when you're an 18 year old working at subway.

I've had a rough time dealing with COVID mentally and the environment I was in played a very big part in that. I thought I had my college future all set up as I had just graduated from a local community college with my AA, focusing in Psych. I was planning to transfer to a local four year and live on campus. I busted my ass for two years to get to that point, working full time and going to school full time but I thought it would all be worth it once I got to University. Then COVID hits and now school is up in the air for the fall semester which just absolutely crushed me. I was so excited to finally get to a four year university... I'd make all these friends, join all these clubs, etc. It would have allowed me to break out of my shell and become more social. So yeah big blow to my mental health since I thought I would be escaping my current living situation and now I'm not. I have since decided to move to Texas and live with my dad in hopes my living situation will be better. Now that I have that all sorted out, I have to worry about school and my future there. I've been researching options for the last week or so. Just keep in mind, my end goal is to get as far as possible in my education with as little debt as possible (tough to do in the USA). 

1. Attend an online four year university from Texas. I've been looking at ASU online and have found a couple degrees there I would be interested in. I would like to talk to some people who have done online college like that, preferably even went to ASU or another one like it in the US. This would be rather expensive in my opinion though as you pay out of state tuition so it's like almost 20k/year for an online school. I don't know my FAFSA situation since I've been collecting unemployment during the pandemic and I'm unsure how that affects my end of the year taxes. 
2. Move somewhere out of country and get my degree abroad. I was thinking somewhere like the University of Iceland... the college tuition would be free but you have to pay yearly for student permit which is about $600 USD. So college is a lot cheaper but I would have to pay for myself to live there; average cost of living is about $1400 USD/ month. I believe you can also only work 15 hours with that student permit, which is nice but also limits your income. I don't know what wages are like out there, haven't checked yet. 
3. Wait to become a Texas resident (12 months from semester start date). If my math is right, I would have to wait 18 months to go back to school in this option. I'm afraid to do this because what if I lose my edge or study habits? Even a Community college will charge me out of state tuition so I don't think I'd do that either in those 18 months. College would be much cheaper though and in 18 months we would hopefully have COVID solved so it would be in person schooling too. 

Any advice or info you could provide on any of this would be great. I'm just having a hard time sorting it all out in my head and I can't really talk to my mom since she'll go nuts that I'm looking at schools in Iceland.

208,noorjo,1595622164,/r/college/comments/hx9aoc/international_guy_trying_to_transfer_from_a_cult/,"Hi all, 

First off, I hope you all are doing fine under these circumstances. So I'll get straight to the point the here. I'm an International student here at Embry Riddle. It's a cult for aviation geeks. I thought it might be a great place to kick start my engineering career as an aerospace/mechanical (astro focus) engineering student but it feels a wrong decision now. Why? First off, it's wayyyy too niche. Everyone's either geeking about planes or playing video games or watching Top Gun. They don't do anything else.. I certainly don't belong here. Not to say I don't like aerospace culture, it's just that I'm more of a guy who enjoys intersection of various fields to achieve one single goal (like MIT/Berkeley/Stanford). Second off, it's too expensive as of now, and thirdly, I don't like the student body here; it's not challenging enough honestly. I don't find people to look up to if you know what I mean.

So now I wanna transfer from here. I'll be starting my sophomore year here this fall and I wish to transfer right after it ends (preferably even before it ends). I have a 3.67 GPA, a couple good engineering projects (propulsion/CAD etc; worked on SpaceX hyperloop challenge but it was cancelled for 2020; competed in an online lunar habitat design competition- didn't win tho ),  one research project under a professor (designed a testing cell for solid motor testing). Apart from that, my prior ECs include building the first of its kind web app (using css, java, html) which blew up and currently has thousands of users per month. I founded an International non-profit in high school which had 300+ members in 20+ countries and focused on helping recognize the talent of Astronomy and Aerospace among communities that didn't have resources to pursue that field. We basically conducted seminars, workshops, had an online establishment with numerous global volunteers and STEM blog writers. I ran it for two years until college kicked in. 

Apart from that, I have the normal ECs like clubs etc. So, do you all think? Can I transfer to a top college which okayish financial aid? I really wanna get out of here since I haven't found that vibe here. As you might have judged by now, I love working on hands-on engineering projects but I also enjoy pursuing other tangentially inclining fields like Product Management, Leadership etc. 

One thing I would really put emphasis on is that I don't come from a privileged background. I'm from north India and I have some serious family history, including dad's alcohol addiction, extreme domestic abuse, one of my parent's external affairs (at some point which almost lead to divorce but things settled later on). I put it here because I was wondering if I can possibly include this in my college application to give the admission officers a better picture of where I come from? I didn't include this in any of my freshman applications but I saw people mentioning these things in the additional essays so I was like maybe I can try mentioning this in transfer apps. 

So what do you all think I should do? I've done some considerable research and found it out it's incredible hard to transfer to a top college, and as an international it's almost impossible. I would really appreciate any kind of help/advice.

Turns out I have one in person class, and only the recitation part is in person. Which is a single period of two or three hours. 

I’m kind of wondering, will they charge me the same amount for online classes that they would charge for normal classes? If that’s the case is it even worth it? I don’t have a lot of confidence in online classes and my ability to learn from them, so I certainly don’t want to pay as much for them as I would for regular classes. 

But idk if I could take a gap year because I honestly have no idea what that would look like with financial aid. Especially since I already filed my fafsa and I have a good scholarship from my school, so I don’t know if that will be there for me when I come back. 

I have signed a lease for an apartment right off campus, but it’s quite expensive, which might have been worth it for the convenience of being close but it’s kinda pointless now. 

I have two roommates that I was planning on living with so I don’t want to screw them over by making them scramble to find another roommate or pay my portion of the rent. I’m hoping it’s not too late to switch to a two person apartment...

My parents are moving out of the house in august to do travel nursing jobs, so I could have a whole house for a little more than what I would be paying for an apartment. And it’s only two hours away so I could probably make it to the one class I have to be present for. 

The more I think about it, the more I want to just live at home. But I don’t know what that will look like with regards to my roommates and my friends. I don’t wanna screw my friends over and I don’t wanna lose touch with people, but it just feels like living near school would be such a waste of money.

211,minervajones123,1594610092,/r/college/comments/hq7rvp/on_my_second_leave_of_absence_from_a_prestigious/,"I went from my being one of the top students in my department during my first year, winning prizes and even being encouraged by my professors to publish, during my year, to one of the most disappointing, lowest achieving, most worrisome and inconsistent student probably on the whole campus. 

I don’t even know what year I am in anymore. I’ve lost count. I think I’ve been at college for a total of three and half semesters, but I’ve taken so many incompletes, withdrawals and even Fs that I’m afraid to look at my transcript anymore unless I absolutely need to. I’m too ashamed, it hurts to look at. 

I took my first leave of absence after just one semester at college. I started out so strong right away and absolutely adored my classes and my professors, and wrote two of the best essays I’ve ever written to date, but by the end of that first semester things had begun rapidly going downhill. I’m still not sure what happened, if it was laziness, ADHD, ADHD medication, poor study habits or a more serious mental illness but I was barely function by the end of that semester. I had literally no friends, but I didn’t mind. I had become obsessed with my English and philosophy classes, and was starting to see all of these amazing connections between everything I was studying, but totally neglected my French class which I ended up failing. I was staying up all night pacing around the campus, developing all of these theories, checking out thirty books from the library at a time, not really eating much or socializing ever, hooked on cigarettes and obsessed with one of my profs. I was making so many bad decisions but I was also really having a good time in my own little world in my head. But I was barely able to write a coherent sentence. My papers were starting to become more and more rambling and I wasn’t finishing them on time, sometimes at all. I eventually, slowly, developed a strange and elaborate paranoid delusion about my favorite professors and became very depressed about it, so much so that I felt unable to stay at school, even though being at home was the last place I thought I’d ever want to be. I decided to take a leave of absence. I didn’t tell anyone about the delusion because I was afraid of what would happen if I did, and at that point I had no idea it was a delusion. During my leave of absence I went to intensive outpatient therapy and was diagnosed with social anxiety and bipolar disorder and prescribed abilify and Wellbutrin, which my mom didn’t want me to take so I never took. Later they would take back the bipolar diagnosis. And then give it back to me and then take it back again. 

My delusion eventually went away after a long time and after telling therapist about it finally and being shocked into reality. I went back to college in the fall, and did okay. I stayed for spring. Did okay but struggled, barely keeping my head above water. 

My mental health declined gradually the next couple of semesters, and I was never as motivated or brilliant as I was that first semester. I wasn’t doing any of my work or getting out of bed. I was obsessed with life memories of my father French kissing me as a child and could not stop thinking about it. I got a little paranoid and even called the police because I thought my roommate was being sexually assaulted but apparently she was listening to music. I started to believe I was suffering from all sorts of terrible diseases. Eventually I became so stressed and depressed and confused that I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days. There was given abilify and had such a bad reaction to it I nearly died. But I didn’t seem as unhealthy as the other people there and to this day I don’t think I deserve to get any slack because I feel like my problems are mostly my fault. 

I’m on my second medical leave now and I’m living with my mom, working at a restaurant. I just share my money with my mom who doesn’t work. We don’t have a house of our own and just bounce between a bunch of places. It can be stressful at times. I’m worried I’ll never be able to succeed. It’s been four years and nothing has changed or been clarified or resolved. It just keeps getting worse and I lose motivation every day. My future looks nonexistent.

I just took a class online which I barely passed but I did. I feel like such an enormous failure. I am still living with my mom at 23. I can’t even drive. I am hooking up with this guy who won’t actually be my boyfriend and even though it makes me feel bad Im afraid to end things or ask for more emotional support. I think he came inside me, and didn’t tell me, and got me pregnant. I had to have a medical abortion a couple weeks ago and didn’t tell anyone. My mom would have murdered me. I don’t know how he would react. I feel so guilty about all of this. I’m such a fuck up. 

I still don’t really have a diagnosis except depression and anxiety. I’m on depression meds and they help. A lot of psychs that I’ve been to try to prescribe me antipsychotics but I’m really afraid of them and my mom is skeptical of mental health field in general. She doesn’t like any of the therapists I’ve been to. I’m afraid of bringing it up to her because she gets upset when I do it seems. Right now I’m not seeing anyone, and just being prescribed antidepressants and add meds by my regular doctor, my mom tells me not to tell them everything because they’ll make me see a psychiatrist who we can’t afford and who will make me take meds that are dangerous. And im scared to be honest since I had such a scary reaction to antipsychotic medication last time and my blood pressure dropped so low. But I need the approval of a psych to go back to school. Right now it feels like I will never be ready to go back. And my mom needs my help here as well. And I’ve already wasted so much of my family and my university’s money. And the states money (during my hospital stay). 

I am likely going to need 2 more full years to graduate. Right now I am on my SECOND leave of absence. I’m amazed they haven’t just kicked me out yet. My dean says my professors say I’m brilliant and they believe in me but I think she’s just saying that to be nice. It’s a very expensive liberal arts college am on a ton of financial aid so I’m taking up the college’s resources. Everyone believes in me and has invested so much into me and I disappoint them time after time after time. I’m so ashamed and afraid. I can’t even walk down the halls of my university without feeling shame. All the profs know a little about my situation and have been so supportive and helpful and given me breaks and I have let them down time after time.

I'm now 30, and my old university basically accepted me back with very few questions asked (thankfully I withdrew the ""right"" way and didn't end up with a failing semester, which was pure luck on my part but I digress). Even better, they offer my program completely online for a pretty reasonable price! I do have to retake a few classes that have expired, but my gen eds are still counting towards my degree. I'm not planning on working while attending school, but I may do some volunteering or part-time work if I feel I can fit it into my schedule without hurting my grades to help my resume post graduation. I'm just looking for some advice, so far here is my list:

* Make dedicated class/lecture times. My courses are asynchronous, but I am a person that works best with a schedule. I'm thinking diving them up MWF and TTh, and doing the actual lectures and discussion forum posts starting at 9:00 - 10:00 am. After that I'll take a break, watch some tv/exercise and then come back later for homework/studying.
* Printing out my syllabuses as soon as I get it and taping it to my walls. Will probably need to take these down during proctored exams though, maybe I'll have them taped up in a secondary room.
* Having a large desk calendar plus a notebook planner with all my due dates and exams highlighted - I don't do well with web calender's for some reason.
* Making sure I still have some social life, which is where the volunteering and/or part time job would come in handy as well.
* I won't be working many hours if any at all, but my husband is working 60-70 hours a week so the bulk of the household chores will be on me, not a huge task but I hate cleaning so I'll need to schedule that in as well.
* Getting more comfortable with webchat and emailing professors as traditional office hours are not an option.
* Brushing up on my stuff over the summer with free online tools, right now I'm using Khan Academy with good success. I'll also do an entry to accounting free course and maybe a stat one before class starts too.

1. NYU doesn't have enough prestige. It sounds horrible when I say it, but I'd rather just own up to my bad thoughts instead of trying to disguise them. I gave myself a lot of flack for thinking like this, but it still just hurts a bit, especially in a culture with such a heavy emphasis on prestige.
2. I'm just worried about what this school is going to be like. I did little to no research before applying here, and I've been to New York City a grand total of once, when I was 8. I don't doubt my ability to create a social life for myself, but it's such a non-traditional college experience that it turns me off a bit. What I generally wanted in a college was a more normal experience with a campus, school spirit, etc but NYU was the best option I was given at the time. Don't get me wrong; I'm extremely grateful that I was granted an offer in the first place.
3. Cost. Without getting too specific, I'm paying almost full price for NYU. While I'm extremely lucky to have parents that can pay for this and insist that they will, I still feel awful over it. My main reason for wanting to transfer to a more ""prestigious"" college, whether I like it or not, is because I feel like I'd be wasting my parents' money if I didn't at least try to maximize my options. I'm already holding a substantial amount of guilt from how high the tuition is.

There are a lot of cons to trying to transfer to a ""better"" uni. I'm not sure what I want at this point - I don't want to be stressed out, but I also kind of have to hit that prestige checkmark at some point for my family. At this point, my choices are either to stress out massively during freshman year for the tiniest chance at a transfer, or to chill a bit but push through 4 years of insanely expensive college to get a small chance to go to a good grad school. Both options are so expensive and it bothers me to even think about them. :/

Please know that I don't consider NYU bad, and that I'm incredibly grateful to be attending such a good university - most of my issues are cultural or personal and tied to my sense of pride.

What do I do with this internal pressure? :( I just want to slow down.

I live with my older sister at an apartment about 3 hours away from home. I go to community college, my sister goes to a university. I was taking some pre-requisite classes for a program I want to be in, finished them all except the biology classes. Since I don’t have the biology classes I need, it’s going to take me a bit longer to finish school and apply for the program I want. I plan on taking a summer class and then moving back home (money for rent is gonna be more expensive next year and I won’t have time for a job) for the fall/spring. Anyway, I told my mother that I wanted to go to this two year “university” school that has a really good health science programs. It’s the only OTA school in Texas area that just seems solid. The degree I want is just two years. I want to go there next fall, when I’m done with my biology classes. My mother said told me no and that she doesn’t want me to go there and that it’s just gonna be too expensive. I told her I could take student loans out/do FASFA/scholarships. She still was like no because we have to support your sister and her university school, blah blah blah... my mom went to school to be a teacher at a average school that wasn’t too expensive honestly and still complains about student loans. What I’m doing is just two years. When I was on the phone with her, my sister overheard (she’s at home with my mom while I’m 3 hours away) and started texting me paragraphs about how I’m stupid and I’m stressing our mother out and how I should just go to community college near home. She told me I was being selfish. On the other hand, my mother told me after I hung up on her (she just kept rambling about how I should stay at home and go to community college, was upset and couldn’t take it) that if I go to the college I want, shes gonna start making me pay my phone/car payment. But my sister who goes to a slightly expensive 4 year university? Pays for nothing. 
It’s my education... I’d much rather go to a school that I know for a fact is good for the program that I want, than a community college near home that I know is just mediocre. I’m not hating on community colleges (I plan on applying to that one too, as a backup) but is this right? Am I not being rational?? I honestly just do not think it’s fair that my mother isn’t supporting me in the college that I wanna go to, just for money. I have friends who are going to university and their parent(s) are doing everything they can do support them. I just feel so small and so sad because I feel like my education isn’t shit to them. I feel like one fo the reasons I chose to get an associates degree is because I didn’t know how I was gonna afford a bachelors, or even masters. It’s not like we don’t have the money either for my education, both my mother and stepfather have decent jobs (50k-55k/yr). And honestly, I hate living at home. It’s somewhat toxic and I prefer being alone. Regardless of this, am I wrong for the education that I want?

219,afalkens,1589436385,/r/college/comments/gjgjzy/i_got_into_nyu_but_im_not_sure_if_i_should_go/,"So I’m currently a second semester freshman at CUNY Brooklyn college. 

I applied on kind of a whim to transfer to NYU. I do have interest in NYU, but I didn’t really expect to get in on the first try. I was kind of viewing it as a practice application for a larger round of transfer applications I would do next year as a sophomore. 

(Some of the other schools I’m interested in require that a student transfers with 60 credits so it was too early for me to apply to them). 

Anyway, I was offered admission into NYU school of arts and sciences. 

I know NYU has a much better reputation than my current school, and I’m tempted to just accept the offer, but here are my concerns:

1. NYU is wayyyyyyy more expensive. So far, I’ve been able to pay all of my Brooklyn college tuition with aid and my own money from working. I don’t have family support to pay my schooling, loan me money, or co-sign with me on private loans. Plus that level of debt is kind of frightening to me. 

2. I’m not positive what I want to do yet. I’m leaning towards double majoring in psychology and film. Maybe I’ll end up just picking one or the other but I’m not sure. I haven’t taken enough classes in either to be certain. If I go to NYU, double majoring or changing majors won’t really be an option. Based on what I’ve heard it will be too expensive and rigorous to do two majors. Also, if I want to do film, I have to apply to NYU Tisch which is specialized and that’s no guarantee. 

3. The commute is a lot longer. I live within 15 minutes walking distance of Brooklyn college and it would be like 45 mins on the train for NYU. 

4. There’s the whole pandemic thing. I’m not even sure if classes will be in person in the fall, and if so that’s even less reason to sign on to a humongous tuition right now. Also, the lesser cost of Brooklyn college means some of my financial aid is supplementing my living expenses next year, so I have a cushion to still be able to survive for awhile until COVID ends and I can work again. With NYU, there would be nothing left over and I would be screwed if the pandemic lasted past August.

5. NYU has a much more rigorous reputation. I don’t normally mind that, but unlike highschool, I’m not just doing school and nothing else. I have to work full time, and I’ve been realizing that I want to try living a more balanced life that includes socializing, health, and creative projects. Brooklyn College has made that a lot easier to manage, but I fear the workload of NYU might throw me into a really unhealthy imbalance of being super overworked all the time. (Even in highschool I became so grade obsessed I barley slept and was anxious all the time). 

6. My best friend lives here with me and also just started going to Brooklyn colleges. He’s had his own journey with school and he’s fairly sure he’s going to stay here for undergrad but our lease is year to year and he could up and decide to go to school in  another random state anytime, and then I wouldn’t be able to afford to stay here. (I pay rent but he offers a more generous split than anyone else would because of our history). So if that happened I would just need to transfer again. 

7. I don’t know what kind of aid other good schools that I’m interested in might offer me, because I haven’t applied there yet. So maybe transferring next year could be a better financial option for me. 


Why I’m considering it:

1. It has a way better reputation and student body. 

2. I’m worried that if I reject it and then do my round of applications next year, I might not get any offers and I’ll have ended up squandering my one opportunity to transfer to a better school which I really would like to do. 
3. Kind of the same as the last two, but I’ll feel like kind of an idiot for rejecting such a good school. My family is really excited for me and on paper it seems like a good opportunity. 


(Sorry I know this was long)

Thoughts?",college,"I got into NYU, but I’m not sure if I should go...",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gjgjzy/i_got_into_nyu_but_im_not_sure_if_i_should_go/,1589454385.0
220,indecisiveernie,1589362510,/r/college/comments/givso3/i_need_advice_on_how_make_a_decision_about_school/,"I was accepted into the same graduate program in tech at NYU and DePaul.

Here are the different factors I'm considering.

NYU would take me 1 full year to complete, DePaul 2 years.

Total overall: NYU around $67,000, DePaul $55,000 (received some scholarship).

Under normal circumstances, as in no virus, I would have 100% chosen NYU. I know it's more expensive, but the style of the program and chance to live in New York and attend this university would be too good to pass up. I am from Oregon, have never been to any state besides bordering ones a couple times and always lived at home even through college, and if I can get a job here then this is where I'll choose to permanently reside after graduating.

However, because of the current situation, I struggle to justify paying quite a bit more when the program could end up fully online (the first half of the year has already been decided to be online). They aren't lowering tuition so I won't get to experience the extent of what I am paying for.

At the same time, NYU still seems like too good of an opportunity. Both the program and school in general are ranked a lot higher up than DePaul. I know logically I shouldn't care about reputation but I am someone who of my friends/circle of people has always been sort of lost, unsure, and by the end of college I got the sense that they didn't really expect me to be highly accomplished. We all went to the same school for undergrad, but while they knew exactly what path they were on and graduated with 4.0's and all that, I was really indecisive about what to do with my life and that made it difficult to have the motivation to do that well in school. All this being said, getting into NYU and the thought of attending makes me feel like I'm not a failure.

Are there any employees/employers or anyone who knows if a school matters that much when looking for a job? Would it look better to have a degree from a more selective school? Should I consider each school's career connections even though I don't plan on living there? NYU would also mean I can't take an internship during the program/Summer, would I be able to get one as a recent graduate or should I just attempt to get a full time job? 

Also: I'm more concerned that I need a good school because I have zero background in this field, my bachelor's and random work experience are fully unrelated, so finding a job will be tough. Before anyone suggests this, I don't want to tell people I got into NYU and then go to a cheaper school because for one thing, I haven't told anyone I applied to schools, haven't even expressed interest in this field, so it will come as a total shock and I don't think they'll take me seriously unless I'm fully enrolled in a program. Plus I need to decide ASAP and don't have time to handle their questions and reactions that I applied to school without telling them first.

222,XleepyJoeBenzo,1588816543,/r/college/comments/gexlp1/how_my_dorm_became_a_dr_g_superhighway_this_story/,"The year was 2012, and we were all supposed to die in December. It was my freshman year of college. I was settling in quite well. I made friends with a bunch of people in our residence hall, we hit it off immediately. We started going out on the weekends, starting with thirsty Thursday, which turns out is actually a thing. I had more than one room mate. We lived in a four person suite with two bedrooms. I had a full ride to my University, so I had a lot of extra money to spend on my living arrangements and meal plan. Oh yeah, I was also a huge pothead.

I made friends with the dealer on my floor and started buying him extra meals in exchange for weed. That's when one of my room mates came to me with a proposition. He asked me if I knew what bitcoins were. I did not. He explained the virtual currency and how it worked. Then he really laid it all out. He told me that he had quite a lot of bitcoins and that he wants to get into selling weed. It all sounded great, but I wasn't sure what he needed me for. He then told me that he doesn't really talk to anyone and that he always sees me with people and going to parties every weekend. Okay, this makes sense. He told me how the operation would work, and it sounded swell. For the record, I was eighteen and very stupid. Anyway, he would purchase the products from the Silk Road, a dark website where you can buy literally fucking anything. Our friend Noah would then get the goods delivered to his apartment, which had a mailroom with hundreds of mailboxes. This was good because it would be just a little bit less suspicious, also his apartment was not on our campus. Then we'd package everything there and move it to our dorm, which had it's own security. We lived in North Philadelphia, so the security and police were always looking out for the students. After we safely had the products, I would find the buyers.

Our first shipment went well. We ordered a half pound of weed, a gram of hash, ten hits of LSD, a small bag of opium (for us), and 1000mg of Alprazolam extract for my room mate's personal anxiety treatment. We got into this business to become weed salesmen. That weed took forever to sell. Everyone who sold weed already had good connections from their hometowns. The LSD though, that sold in five fucking minutes to one buyer who was interested in buying much more than ten hits. He asked us if we could sell him a couple hundred tabs. He said he'd pay $350 for each sheet of 100. We looked at the price per sheet on the Silk Road. It would cost us only $80 each. Yes sir, we can absolutely sell you a couple sheets. We told him we'd call him when it arrived. Later that night we brewed some opium tea and celebrated entering the LSD business. We bought the sheets for him, and we also bought two extras in case anyone else wanted some.

The next shipment came with no problems. Our friend came over and bought the sheets we had promised him. We made nearly $800 on that deal. We thought that was a lot, so we celebrated. Later that same day, while smoking a blunt in our courtyard, I made friends with some art students. They invited me to their dorm on the third floor. I agreed, went with them, and we listened to music and painted the walls of the dorm room which was super against the rules. They started talking about how they had taken magic mushrooms two weeks before and how it was life changing. I told them I had two-hundred hits of acid in my room. I've never seen people get so excited in my entire life. They bought all of it. They paid $400 for each sheet. Seemingly out of nowhere we made $600. Again, we thought this was a lot.

My room mate was really happy with my networking abilities. Dude, I was just getting high with some hipster art students. I didn't really possess the ""networking skills"" that everyone thought I had. We went online and purchased another five sheets. We started getting a bit more confident in our ability to sell this magic money making paper. That week I was in one of my classes and had to do a group project with a kid named Eddy. We went to his apartment to work on the project after class. Eddy had an apartment off campus because he was an upperclassman. On the way he asked if I smoked weed. Of course. He said he had something to show me. When we got there he showed me a small weed plant he was growing. It was an adorable little plant in a flower pot by the window. I asked if he needed any weed and he said that he did not. We smoked a bit and then her offered me a Xanax. I had never taken Xanax, so I googled the pill he offered me. Alprazolam. Huh, that's funny. I told him I had 1000mg of alprazolam in my room. This excited him.

I asked my room mate if he was willing to sell some of his private stash. Eddy only wanted to buy around 100 milligrams. He agreed and I brought Eddy to my dorm. We gave it to him for the cool price of $150, a slick markdown from what he was paying. After all we hadn't even planned on selling that stuff. He asked how we got it so cheap and if we could get anything else. We told him that we sell LSD. He said he loves hallucinogens and would love to purchase a sheet, so he did. Four sheets left. If we sell them, we can get a new and faster computer.

The weekend came and I was hanging out with two of my friends from our residence hall. Joe, who was really chill and loved smoking weed as much as I did. And Bianca, who was so cool that it frightened me. She was really intimidating. I had a huge crush on her, but she was ""talking"" to a kid that lived in Johnson and Hardwick hall. Bianca was the type of person you see in movies about cool kids doing cool things. A character who has a lot of depth, but it takes nearly the whole movie to slowly peel back the layers, and by that time you're in love. I told her if we sold the rest of our acid I'd buy her a new tattoo. She was covered in them. That night Joe was going to take us to his friend Jamie's house. We were going to try cocaine for the first time. I was terrified. Not only was I terrified about trying cocaine, but I was scared of doing it with Bianca. I just didn't know how I would act, and I didn't want to do something stupid.

We arrived at Jamie's house. Jamie was also intimidating. His house was what your typical trap house looked like at the time, with a bunch of really expensive music equipment. Everybody wanted to be a rapper or a D.J. that year. He introduced all his friends and offered us lines of coke. Here we go. Joe went first, he'd already done some before. Bianca went next without hesitation. Now it was my turn. I remember my hand shaking with the rolled up bill between my fingers. I chose the smallest line and sniffed. It did not taste anything like I expected. Five minutes went by. Oh, this is what cocaine is like. It was so underwhelming. It was also some thoroughly stepped on shit. I know that now because since then I've done some foreign blow that literally almost made my heart stop. Anyway, Jamie and I got to talking, mostly about his ""music career"". Jamie told me if I ever wanted to buy cocaine in bulk to hit him up. I laughed and told him if he ever wanted to buy LSD in bulk to hit me up. I was half joking. He looked at me with the straightest face and asked if I was serious. Honestly, this Jamie guy really scared the shit out of me. He was a good ten inches taller than me and the whole scene was really starting to freak me out. I told him I was serious though. He told me to come with him.

He brought me into his room and closed the door. In the room it was quiet. The walls were sound proofed. I looked around and the room was full of money, cocaine, and guns. Okay, he's probably not going to kill me. I hope. He then asked about my LSD connection. I told him I could get sheets for $350. He said he wanted books. Books? This guy wants books? I didn't know this at the time, but a book is a thousand hits of LSD. I told him I had to talk to some people and I would let him know the price, but that I could definitely make it happen. We went back into the party and he gave me line after line of cocaine. Joe offered him money for the lines, but Jamie told him not to pay. He said your friend here bought you guys as much coke as you want for the night. Honestly, that made me feel really cool. After the party I talked to my room mate and told him what happened. We looked up the price of a book on the Silk Road. $300. Not only could we have saved a lot of money if we had just bought a book from the start, but we were going to make a lot more money selling by the book. The days of getting excited over $800 were about to come to an abrupt end.

I talked to Jamie and asked how much he would be willing to pay for each book. He said he would pay no more than $3000 for each book. We decided we would sell him the books for $2,800 each. He agreed and asked how many we had. I said we can start with five books. He agreed. This was perfect. Not only were we about to make more money than we had ever expected, but acid was incredibly easy to ship. They were basically sheets of paper. Our supplier used to send it to us in between the pages of large children's coloring books. The books, or prints, as our supplier called them, blended with the kid's books very well. Our prints consisted of a large picture of Bart Simpson, The Grateful Dead bears, and a double rainbow portrait. If you didn't know what acid was, you wouldn't know these were dr\*gs. We made nearly $14,000 from that first deal.

Over the course of a few months we would sell close to thirty-thousand hits of LSD. We had $75,000 in cash sitting in an empty bedroom at Noah's apartment. I stopped going to class. My room mate had filled his entire room with computer parts and instruments. Noah, well we didn't really see him much, but he was always present when we needed a shipment. We broke our cardinal rule of not getting high on our own supply. We took a lot of acid that semester. It was an extremely enlightening period for us. Things in my world began to take on entirely new meaning. I had a newfound appreciation for things I had never noticed. The connections with my friends became very strong and we talked about a lot of stuff that was just too deep for my other peers to even scratch the surface of. It was nice.

By my birthday in February we had over $200,000 in cash. We didn't die in December, not that I thought we would, but some people were legitimately surprised. They were mostly art students. Things started getting a little crazy. My room mate and I were taking a lot of Xanax by this time and a lot of nights celebrating were never logged as memories. We always told ourselves we would only sell LSD. We had sparked a huge psychedelic scene in and around Philadelphia. There were literally parties where everyone was tripping acid. Many groups of people began taking acid and doing really creative stuff that I admired so much. So much good music and art was around during that period. I felt like I was living in San Fransisco in the middle 60's. It felt like we were part of this incredible scene that nobody outside of the city knew about. Of course every wave has to break and roll back.

It was getting close to the summer. I hadn't been to class in months. We hadn't seen Noah since the previous shipment about a month prior. It was a regular weekday, but I wasn't going to class, so I took two hits of acid. I spent most of that evening and night writing and yapping into my tape recorder. I was on the subject of togetherness and how there are so many things that are so incredible that we never notice even though they're right in front of us. Acid talk. I was looking at a glass of water, thinking about its importance, and how so many of us take it for granted. That's when my room mate came home. This was *my* room mate though. Remember, we had a two bedroom, four person suite. *My* room mate, who was never involved in our operation. He was obliterated, and not from alcohol. This was something else. He limped into the room and collapsed on the bed. I immediately got the rest of my room mates together. That's when Christian told me what transpired earlier while I was locked in the bedroom tripping acid. He told me that my room mate had broken up with his girlfriend, took an entire bottle of lorazepam, and tried to cut his leg open with my biology scalpel. What the fuck.

I examined his leg and he did not *try* to cut it open, he succeeded. He had a gigantic cut all the way down his lower leg that was fixed up by his father who is a surgeon. His father then brought him back to the dorm. The condition he was in was terrifying. He was breathing, but not well. His heart rate was also very low and we had to monitor him for the remainder of the night, taking shifts to make sure he didn't stop breathing. I couldn't believe his father had brought him back in the condition he was in. The next morning I was exhausted. My room mate and I, the one with the bitcoins, left and went to Noah's apartment to relax for an hour. While we were gone Bianca was to watch over him with her room mate. When we got to Noah's we had a new problem. Noah hadn't gotten out of bed for what looked like weeks. He had ran out of his antidepressants and was in bad shape. At this point I checked out. I walked into the living room and opened a bottle of champagne. I poured a glass, popped a Xanax, and sat on the sofa. I was still a little foggy from my acid trip and I hadn't slept all night. That's when my phone rang. It was Bianca.

I answered the phone and her first words were: ""Your room is full of police."". Well, it's been a good run. On my desk were a couple thousand hits of LSD and a handgun. In the other bedroom were numerous unopened box's of expensive computer parts, scales and paraphernalia galore, and a large pile of white powdered alprazolam. That room also smelled heavily of weed because there was a half pound out in the open. We had gotten very sloppy. I asked her if my room mate was okay. She said that's why the police are there. She said his mom was trying to reach him and he wasn't answering her, so she called the police for a wellness check. Bianca then started talking to someone and hung up the phone.

We pondered whether or not to flee the country and become outlaws. We did after all have all the cash here at Noah's. Close to a million dollars. Maybe more. Because we were getting sloppy, we had also started selling hash, Xanax, LSD, 25i-NBOMe, 2c-b, 2c-i, 2c-E, Mescaline, cocaine, MDMA, MDA, LSA, clonazepam, ativan, and other various designer chemicals. We were going down for a long time. I started thinking about my life. It literally was flashing before my eyes. I thought about my high school crush, and how I should have been more upfront with her about how much I liked her. I loved her. I thought about the time we slept in the same bed and I couldn't fall asleep because I couldn't believe she was really laying next to me. I remembered how I never wanted to wake up next to anyone else. I thought about my trivial crush on Bianca and how shallow it really was. I thought about my parents and how they'd raised me better. How they did so much for me so that I could go away to college and have a better life than they had. I thought about sitting on the beach last summer without a care in the world. The ""problems"" in my life that seemed hilarious now. Will I go to prom? Is my car cool enough? My k/d ratio in Call of Duty. How could so much happen in less than a year? That's when Bianca called me again.

I was terrified to pick up that phone. We looked outside to see if police were surrounding the apartment complex. They were not. I answered the phone. She said the police were gone. She had put my gun and LSD in my desk drawer. The police never entered the other bedroom. It was just a wellness check. An ambulance came and took my room mate. He was going to be okay. I hugged my partner in crime and we cried. I wish I could tell you we cleaned up our lives after that. My room mate with the bitcoins developed a really dangerous substance abuse habits after that. He spent most of his money over the next few years. I went back to class after that summer, but stopped going again because I wanted to party instead and start a career as a writer. I failed out of college. Throughout the years I went on numerous adventures all around the world. I have hundreds of stories, I just have to write them. Oh and I have to learn how to write properly. I don't use a lot of substances today, and I don't encourage people to use dr\*gs of any kind. I have unfortunately lost many friends during the opiate epidemic. Weed is cool though, I like weed. I wouldn't tell people to smoke it, but I'll never shame someone for enjoying some cannabis. Actually, I don't really shame people for anything, it's just not my place to judge anyone. Feel free to judge me though, about how my dorm room became a dr\*g superhighway.

TL;DR
With two weeks until graduation, I have a few words of advice: 

I am not saying to abandon your art degree. I am saying to seriously consider your return on investment. How much will it cost? How much will you be making after going to school? How long will it take to pay off your loans? This goes for any degree. 

Another thing: take your total semester tuition and figure out the math to find out how much money you are spending per in-person class. Say your tuition is $12,000. You’re taking five classes. 12,000/5= $2,400 a class. Your class meets twice a week for 16 weeks, (32 times). Each in person class is $75 a class ($2,400/32). Take pride in your work. Don’t ditch. Try to learn something and pay attention. 

Unless dorming is an absolute necessity, as in driving more than 45 minutes-hour each way, don’t do it. I know way too many privileged people that needed the “college experience”, dormed despite living less than 30 minutes away, and have insane amounts of debt. They’re all moving back home. 

Consider going to the least expensive option you have. 

Another HUGE piece of advice, don’t go away to college to study anything that can be studied at your local, state university, even if the program is better. It would have been a foolish waste of money for me to study accounting at a private college. (Unless you get an insane scholarship)

Instead, if you get accepted into another specific program, such as a physics program, and the closest program is the one you’ve been accepted to, but it’s far, then dorm! The point is, living at school will cost roughly a minimum of $40,000. That is a substantial amount of money; quite literally a downpayment on a condo!!

In short, dorm if you live too far from a university or if your program/field of study is far away. (Not many state colleges offer aerospace engineering or something like that). When figuring out whether to dorm or not, consider your career prospects given your major of study- you must. 

Also, definitely consider community college!! People who do this route wind up with the same degree after transferring to a four year college!

I didn’t realize that even at a state school, while saving money on not dorming as a commuter, a local, state education is still one the largest financial decisions of your life. It’s easily $50,000-$60,000. I had little concept of this at 18. If you’re unsure of what you want to study, and you don’t have a scholarship contingent on you attending this fall, consider a gap year. I don’t want this to come off as privileged; instead, I want to illustrate the point that it’s much better to take time off than racking up $40k of debt before dropping out! However, rather than traveling, use the time to try to figure out just what it is you’re interested in. With these uncertain economic times and unprecedented amounts of student loan debt, we are in very similar economic positions as those in the Great Depression. 

Use Amazon to rent to textbooks. 

Use rate my professor- not to take the easy way out with easy professors, but instead to avoid exceptionally poor professors if possible.

You can still pursue your arts outside of your area of study. There’s no shame in being addicted to food, water, and shelter. Thus we’re tied to a capitalistic system. You are not a sellout if you decide to change your mind and venture from art. 

Work hard. Don’t sweat the small stuff though. 

For many entry-level jobs, it doesn’t matter what you study so long as you have a degree. 

Regardless of what you’re studying, don’t limit yourself to identifying with that given major. 

Beware of 5 year arts programs!! (5 year bachelor programs are most practical if they’re necessary for your degree, or if your bachelor degree has a high return on investment. 

Avoid drugs, alcohol, and caffeine. Don’t become dependent on them. 

College is entirely what you make of it. If you study hard, but go to a local school, you’ll thrive. 

I’m graduating with a 3.84 GPA with a Bachelor of Science and minor in economics. During college, the internship I had paid $17 an hour and I’ll be graduating with no debt. I have a position lined up for $62,000, and I plan on moving out soon. I would never have been able to do these things had I continued down my original path of music, which I highlight below. I also attribute my lack of debt to COMMUTING. As of now, I have the time to pursue my love for music outside of school, yet I received a much broader education, having taken many more gen eds than a typical music major! I’m not advocating that money=happiness, but sadly we need it. I’m advocating for those unsure of their degree, to be open to any possibility. 

YOUR COLLEGE MAJOR IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TO YOUR PASSION. 
Often times, you can study your passion outside of a more practical degree. You love English, but want better job security? Do English education! You love music but are fearful of job prospects? Become a musical scientist! You love history but don’t want to teach? Study history in your leisure and study something with a better career prospect. You become more well-rounded that way, too! Plus, you can combine a more practical degree with your passion!

The degree doesn’t make you talented- your hard work does. You can become a talented writer without studying it in college. Plus if you study what you’re familiar with, you might only get marginally better. For instance, where I’m at a musician versus where I’d be had I pursued it in college wouldn’t make a difference to an average listener!

You can define yourself as an artist or musician yet still study something like math, science, etc. It’s frustrating we don’t economically incentivize humanities or arts outside of academia, but it’s true. And I came to that realization, if you want to read my story!

Here’s some books I read in college
The Accounting Game- if you enjoy it, you’ll probably enjoy accounting. Be warned, though, long hours exist in this field depending on where you go post-college. 
The Little Book of Common Sense Investing
Where the Crawdads Sing
This is Your Brain on Music
The Cigarette Century
Walden
One More Thing
In The Shadow Of Man
Firefighting
100 Heartbeats
The Joy Of Living
Musicophilia

If you read throughout college, you can get yourself a Harvard education for the price of a book! Apply yourself. 

My story:
Four years ago, when I was a naïve high school senior, I had one goal: make it into a very competitive jazz program and get my undergraduate degree in Jazz Performance and Music Education. 

I was rejected, and I remember feeling shattered for not being “good enough” at my craft. 

During this time, I also felt pressure to attend college immediately upon graduating high school in the spring, because I had a substantial scholarship that was contingent upon me beginning my collegiate career in the fall of that same year. 

I wound up attending, going in declared as a Musical Studies major. It was during my first two months where I realized it just wasn’t for me. (I still remember sitting in a choir class with roughly 80 other students doing “lip trills”, and that’s where it “clicked” with me.) I was paying $75 a class for this!

Another huge disadvantage of a music degree were the 0 and 1 credit courses. Every semester you wind up taking 9-13 courses- many 0 and 1 credit courses. For me, taking 9 classes, (only 16 credits I think), was just too much for me to handle compared to the 4 at a time I was used to taking in high school. (We had a block schedule, set up very similar to college, with a fall and spring semester. We take 4 classes in the fall and 4 in the winter). I wouldn’t have minded putting in this extra work. But after college, job prospects are rather bleak for music majors. Why put in extra work for less return? (Unless you truly BREATHE it). 

One of the biggest disadvantages of a music degree is the lack of a well-rounded education. At least at my school, I think that some general education courses (gen eds) are waived in order for you to take music courses. I also know of some schools which require 5 years to get a bachelor’s in music education and performance. 

If I had one piece of advice for myself back then, it would be to not limit myself. I now believe that a person interested in a given subject can become passionate about another one that uses similar skillsets. Back then, I was more idealistic than practical, and it actually limited my thinking. 
Idealistic thinking: I can only be happy if I study music. Practical thinking: I can apply the same discipline and work ethic I put into music somewhere else, and still be happy.

For me, it was surprisingly accounting. The theoretical side of music has always interested me. Likewise, the theories and frameworks in accounting are similar to musical theory in the sense that they are quite logical. I’d even argue it uses that same analytical side of the brain found in the analysis of a musical piece. 

You may love music, but find yourself interested in other areas, too. After reading “This is your brain on music”, I thought it would be just as cool to study neuroscience!

I believe that the advice, “Do what you love”, is terrible. There are plenty of necessary jobs that people do not love, but are incredibly important for the function of our society. For example, garbagemen, mailmen, grocery store workers, and all front-line workers during this time are vital! We owe them a lot of gratitude; they are truly heroes during this crisis. I doubt they are loving what they are doing now though. 

Doing what you love may stem from privilege. Some people do not have the option to do what they love, which shouldn’t preclude you from doing what you love, but the recognition of this fact is important!

Additionally, I want to see everyone going into college, set up financially. On that note: 

In the past, now I could be wrong, but college was not only cheaper even when adjusted for inflation, but there was less competition. (There
were less people in the world, and we are now becoming highly educated and affluent.) An increasing number of people now have a college degree. It’s becoming the norm.

It astounds me that we expect 18 year olds to make major life decisions. When I was that age, my concept of money was very limited. After paying for the majority of my education through scholarship and work (~85-90%), I can assure you that it is a serious financial decision that requires a lot of planning. 

As a result, we must face the ultimate reality that our society does not place economic value or incentives to art, unless you are a pop music star. I know way too many talented musicians- far more talented than celebrities- that work multiple jobs in order to support themselves. Especially during these uncertain times, where only “essential” workers are working, please keep this fact in mind. Even in times of economic prosperity, there is typically only one music teacher per district, and even then, art programs are given a low priority compared to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, math). 

(I’m not saying I agree with this, it is just a sad fact that I had to realize. A hard pill I swallowed).

Sadly, college is not what it should be. Instead of cultivating a learning environment for the betterment of oneself, it is purely a business. (Perhaps it was always this way). 

It seems that they can exploit college students who are seeking an education in the arts and humanities. The colleges and universities know very well that these degrees have less than ideal job prospects, but charge the same amount for a degree that has better prospects. To me, this is evidence that these degrees are offered solely to capitalize on other idealistic college students like myself. 

I gigged in college and even wound up playing with musicians that made it into the jazz program. I wouldn’t have known from their playing. They were not substantially better or worse! It was reassuring. And it proves that your major should not define you. I also got the privilege to play with Jake Shimabukuro, my musical hero! And without a college degree!

If I was a father whose kid wanted to pursue music after high school, I would encourage his music career... But I’d dissuade him from majoring in music. If he wanted to pursue only music, I’d might even encourage him to not attend college at all. (After conducting an interview project with many touring musicians, I realized they came from a variety of backgrounds.) 

Of course some programs are necessary. If you want to be a teacher or a classical musician, you must get a college education. But keep in mind, especially during this pandemic, it will be very economically challenging, both in looking for a job and the career growth after attaining one. 

That being said, music has a huge role in my life. However, because of where I am financially having not studied music, I can come back to it, pursue it as a hobby, an enthusiast, and it’s always there for me. 

Any other college grads feel like this?

Im just a lost boy trying to figure out some stuff. It’s also quite lengthy so forgive me for that. I’m currently a sophomore in community college preparing to transfer for fall 2020. I have a couple of options that are making me have a hard time in deciding which university is the best for me in terms of enjoyment and job prospects. I’m still unsure of my job path but I most definitely won’t be doing accounting. I’m thinking maybe finance/analyst/consulting, but I still have no knowledge in those fields, so I’m kind of doubting my ability to score that high. I’m sort of interested in business and technology combined, but I have no coding background either so I’m kind of lost. If anyone could help me out, that would be great! My time is cutting short and I just don’t know what to do. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Here is the list:

UCSD - admitted for international business
pros - further away from home (2 hours) and I heard the program is relatively easier so there’s a higher chance of getting a better gpa 
Cons- not quite sure if this program is strong as it’s relatively new I believe
UCSB - admitted for Pre-Econ/accounting 
Pros - gorgeous campus and seems like I’d have a good time here
Cons - heard the program is cutthroat since I have to take econ 10a(a weeder course) to officially be admitted into the course. Not sure if this is a target school for what I’m trying to achieve.
UCI - admitted for Business Administration
Pros - easier major so more time for internships and stronger gpa. Also has emphases like finance and information systems. Have always dreamt of coming here after being waitlist from HS. 
Cons - commuter school so it won’t be as lively as other campuses. Also, not sure if prestige matters for my route but if it is, then I think maybe UCLA and USC is better? I definitely want a decent job out of undergrad that’s sustainable.
UCLA - waitlisted for pre-econ 
Pros - awesome food and it’s the number 1 public university. Girlfriend goes here too but idk if that’s a pro since it also has its cons so I’m just gonna leave that as is.
Cons - pre-Econ major so I have to pass the weeder courses. Class sizes will most likely be really big with a couple hundred students as economics is an impacted major. Expensive housing since it’s in Westwood. Also not a big fan of the architecture 
USC - still awaiting for decision 
Pros - best program out of this list. Trojan network(if it’s really real)
Cons - also not a fan of the architecture(the bricks). Very close to home(20-25mins), meaning it would make me guilty to live independently as my home is not too far, but I definitely want to be away from my parents and experience these two upcoming years as an adult living with others. Not sure if I really like the campus.",college,Urgent help on transfer options,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g9loqi/urgent_help_on_transfer_options/,1588092133.0

I would greatly appreciate help with picking which college to go to as I'm struggling to make a choice. I'm undecided in terms of major. My parents have about 80k to go towards my education

I'm considering:

1. Fordham University: It's in the city of my dreams but even with scholarships, its 50k per year. I really like the school but it's expensive! Definitely my top choice but the price is daunting. 

2. Marymount Manhattan: Its also in the city of my dreams and it's about 30k per year. This is cheaper than in-state options. It's an art school and I'm not interested in the arts. It has like a 45% graduation rate. I could go for 2 years then transfer somewhere better, right?

3. William &amp; Mary: This was my favorite school in my state. I got no scholarships or aid so its 41k per year which just seems too much. It's super close to home which I dont love. If I stayed at home and commuted, it would be 26k per year.

4. Community College: It would only be 6k per year but I feel like I'd get super depressed with all my friends leaving and going to 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**UNC-CH**

*pros*:

* nearby; easier to go home
* Planning on spending 4 years, but I’m coming in w a lot of college creds so I have legroom to double major
* prestigious institutional scholarship for URMs in STEM; provides mentoring, free tutoring, connections in STEM depts, tight-knit community, GRE prep, and guidance with grad school apps.
* Familiarity with campus and a lot of the student body! this would make for an easier adjustment and possibly better student experience
* school pride! People go hard for their school lol
* “Big fish” (not so little pond though lol). But I could be one of the higher-performing students - possibly stand out to employers/grad schools

*cons*:

* full ride first two years (no work study or anything), but may have to pay $9k for second two years (also possible to have most of the second two years covered). my point is: uncertainty ab $$ for jr and sr yrs.
* I’m not sure what my major is yet, but in case I wanted to do engineering, the only kind they have is BME
* i’m not crazy about UNC (even though it’s an awesome uni), so going there feels like the “safer” option
* Cornell is big, but UNC is bigger (around 20k ug enrollment). Idk if I want big
* More common to have big lecture halls (which I really don’t like)
* Would be staying nearby; I’ve always wanted to go OOS for college, and idk if wanna stay in NC for the rest of my life lol

**Cornell**

*pros*:

* Far away; can go out of comfort zone
* Beautiful campus!!
* Nature nearby; botanical gardens, hiking, and gorges
* A lot more singles in ug housing, would be easier to get one if I wanted
* I got into this program in the CAS (Milstein Program for Technology and Humanity). Offers small seminars, exclusive speakers, and students spend two summers in NYC on the Cornell Tech campus
* Possible ivy connections? Idk if I should weigh this too much, but like the name may help w getting employment
* Though they don’t select students until after the May 1st deadline, there’s a scholarship (Kessler Presidential) that eliminates student summer contribution for FGLI students, provides community in the program, and helps students w networking and professional development
* diversity: there are big muslim and black communities there (whom I identify with).
* Great fin aid package! I’d be paying $5k/yr - possibly less if I get that earlier scholarship (which I *think* I’m a strong candidate for?)
* Dining halls have RLLY good food!!

*cons*:

* Out-of-pocket costs: $100 bus passes/yr after freshman year, $100/yr for gym and another $100 for fitness classes. Also cost of moving in and plane tix may be about $300 round trip
* I hear Ubers are expensive there
* ithaca is pretty rural; nearest big city is Syracuse, which is still about an hour away :/
* Housing isn’t guaranteed all four years, however fin aid can compensate for off-campus housing
* Housing is pretty random. You can pick a roommate but dorm ranking isn’t always followed. This may be an issue because older dorms are a little more run-down w no A/C and some are a lot newer and nicer
* Students may be stressed :( uncertainty about student culture/“vibe” bc I haven’t visited campus. I’ve heard mixed things about friendly students and lonely students
* If I stay in that program in CAS, I couldn’t major in any engineering, but only minor in it 
* I may be pretty average and not one of the relatively “higher-performing” students there",college,Help me decide!! pls lol. UNC vs Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g88wt7/help_me_decide_pls_lol_unc_vs_cornell/,1587897213.0

**Schools:** UW (Seattle) v.s. UCLA

**Major:** Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics (UCLA) and Pre-Science (UW). My intended field is biology, but I’m not sure how the two schools compare in this field.

**Total Cost:** 27K--UW with in-state tuition;  65K--UCLA

**UCLA Pros:**

* More name recognition (Although I’m not sure if this will make a big difference in opportunity in my field)
* The clout, ngl
* Wayyy better weather, better atmosphere?
* More opportunities to get outside my comfort zone and perhaps have a better college experience?
* Good food options

**UCLA Cons:**

* A lot more expensive
   * My parents have said that they can pay for UCLA, but I don’t want them to spend too much money on a school that is not necessarily better than UW
* LA may be too overwhelming or different? (I’ve never visited thanks to Corona virus)
* I know this shouldn’t be as big a factor of a factor, but my boyfriend will go to UW and he’s important to me

**UW Pros:**

* Cheaper, and not a bad school at all
* Bf
* I’m still figuring out what I want to do after college, so there might be more room to figure out my major before committing
* More familiar, closer to home

**UW Cons:**

* Rainy Seattle weather
* I’ve heard a lot about the competitive/toxic nature of UW’s undergraduate programs
* Also heard a lot about grade deflation (just rumors, don’t know how true this is)
* Less opportunities to branch out/become more independent

**Other factors that I want to consider but don’t know much about:**

* The quality of professors
* Alumni Network
* Success after graduation
* Graduating early (preferably in 3 years)
   * How many prerequisites are required
* Campus quality (though from what I can tell, both cities and campuses are beautiful)
* Dorms/facilities quality
* Whether they accept AP credit and dual credit
* Also maybeeee double majoring or minoring in Piano or English

I'm currently in my last semester in community college, and after I will have an Associates in Engineering Science (Taking D.E and Statics this semester)

I am transferring in-state(NJ) due to the cheaper tuition and I have been accepted into NJIT, just applied to MSU and will be applying (or won't) to Rutgers once I figure out what I am doing. 

Like the title states I'm turning 23 and I will have an A.S in Engineering and be close to graduating as an engineer but that simply is not what I am interested in at all and chose it simply for the money. 

I've thought about applying to RU's pharamacy school but that would extend my graduation by another 4.5 years easily, which is something I can't do in my situation as I should be producing.

I chose engineering because ""JOBS"" and I know I can still go through it and get my degree but I was never an engineering guy, my mind has never worked in that creative and inventive way. A major reason why I took it was because I had/have(still working on) my introverted personality along with mental health issues that I took care of.

I’m not trying to be egotistical but I have pretty damn good grades, a solid SAT score, hella extracurriculars. And I’ve been no go for UC Davis, San Diego and Santa Barbara.

Hey guys. I'm posting this as I sit in my bed crying. I am completely out of ideas and completely hopeless.

In middle school I got a 4.0 GPA. I was in advanced classes and I was the teacher's pet and I did all sorts of extracurricular activities. I found my friends in middle school and I did really well. I procrastinated a bit but not much.

In high school I earned a 3.75 GPA. I procrastinated chronically but I always got things in on time even if it meant pulling three all nighters in a row (I do *not* recommend this). I always started things last second and turned them in right as I finished them at the latest possible moment. As time went on, this habit got worse and worse until I was emailing my teachers begging for an extension on my projects. I'm a teacher's pet, I'm extremely good at communicating, and I'm pretty convincing. These things all led to my teachers usually allowing me extra time to turn things in. And when I got my work in, it was exceptional and above and beyond expectations. I overacheived to compensate for my lateness. By my senior year it was pretty bad and I started not asking for extensions because I was so afraid to ask for too many. I did not want to risk coming across as lying or lazy. But it didn't ruin my GPA because I had a 4.0 all the way until junior year and I got decent grades in my junior year.

My freshman year of college left me with an abysmal 2.75 GPA. I didn't ask for extensions anymore because by then I became unable to get things turned in even if I had a large extension. I became incredibly depressed and nihilistic during my freshman year. I never left my dorm and all I did was sleep and watch YouTube to distract myself from the pain in my heart. Many a night saw me sobbing into my pillow and wishing I could just die. I failed my English class because I was so afraid of the final paper that I never even touched it.

My first semester of my sophomore year went pretty much the same way. I retook English and did extremely well up until the final paper, where I got farther along than last year but eventually became too terrified of it to continue, and I failed the class again. I had to pursue medical hardship withdrawal from philosophy because I missed so much class due to being so depressed and hopeless that I could never make it to class. I was surprisingly happy for the first half of that semester. I just detached myself from the pain I felt over not being able to do anything right. It caught up with me when finals week came along and I couldn't do anything to save my grades anymore. I got a 1.67 GPA.

I'm now in my second semester of my sophomore year. I'm on academic probation, which just means I have to meet with my academic advisor every other week and I'm not allowed to get more than one grade below a C. Unfortunately my advisor is extremely unhelpful and sometimes actually harmful. She has advised me incorrectly many times now. She doesn't really understand me either. I told myself this semester would be different. But then again, I also told myself that before every other semester. I'm about 8 weeks in and it's time for midterms. I've missed countless classes and I have done absolutely none of my work.

I'm going to fail again. I have a phobia of my work that neither I nor anyone else in this entire earth seems to understand. I have a job in IT (my major is CIS) and I do perfectly well in that job. I have no issues getting things done on time and I have kept the job for over a year now. One would think that how you do in school is predictive of how you will do in the ""real world"", but clearly that's not true in my case. I am not stupid. I got very high SAT scores and I have a great scholarship. As I hope you can tell from this post, I am also not bad at writing. That is why it pains me so much to fail classes like English and get such a low GPA. All I want to do is learn. I love to learn more than anything. My issues are not due not wanting to learn.

My college is unbelievably expensive and my parents are only paying for part of it (that is, if I graduate). The pressure from this is incredibly hard to bear the weight of. My parents don't understand me and only make me feel more worthless when I say anything about my schoolwork to them so I end up having to hide everything until it finally comes out at the end of the year that ""surprise, your daughter is a complete failure again!"".

To make matters worse, I have medical problems that make life even harder (IBS, hemochromatosis, chronic migraines, and narcolepsy). When I start to do well, I am punched down by one of these issues and it takes me a while to get back up again so I miss things while I'm down that make my grades drop all over again.

I have pursued medical treatment for all of my issues. I have gone through many counselors, none of which could help me. I have tried  (and am continuing to try) many medications for my mental health (I have severe ADHD and social anxiety). 

I'm in an endless cycle. I feel like I just want to curl up into a ball and cry forever. No one understands me, no one can help me. It feels like I've been given everything (intelligence, a somewhat wealthy family that loves me, and people who want to help me) but I can do nothing with what has been given to me. I wish I could just ""take one step at a time"" or ""be less hard on"" myself. I wish I could believe that ""everything's gonna be okay"". But I can't. I am useless and self destructive. I have no where to turn. I have tried everything I know of. I am so alone and so angry at myself that I hate myself more than anything in this earth.

Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation? Is there anything else I can try?",college,I'm self destructing,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fc61kg/im_self_destructing/,1583138448.0
241,Esani,1582970228,/r/college/comments/fbag0s/i_keep_sabotaging_myself/,"I am in my sophomore year of college and I keep sabotaging myself. I do not know what to do. My dream, ever since starting college, was to study abroad for a year. Throughout high school, I got good grades and high scores on AP and IB tests. I worked really hard and hoped it would pay off. 

Freshman year, I went to a large out of state college. I ended up transferring out because I started to have severe anxiety problems towards the end of my time there. That decision to transfer was the hardest decision I ever made. I had a lot of things going for me at that university. I had great friends, good food, and a sports team I was highly dedicated to. But due to my indecision, the fact that I didn't realize I was experiencing severe anxiety at the time, and pressure from my parents, I ended up transferring out of the university. I realize I could have waited one more semester, but I genuinely did not understand what was wrong with me at the time and did not see a way for it to get better. I also made the decision since studying abroad for a year was important to me, and I was worried that staying one more semester may have jeopardized my chances to study abroad for a full year.

For sophomore year, I have been at my in-state university. I do not like my in-state university as much as the first one (and knew that even when transferring). It has less options that suit my interests and is slightly more expensive than the other school since I do not have a scholarship here. While I did struggle to find my niche at the beginning (especially since I was still working through anxiety problems), I have found a group of like-minded friends that are all also interested in having these international experiences. I have also became really good friends with one of the exchange students from Japan, which is where I would like to study abroad if I were to do so. 

I've really wanted to go on a year long study abroad at my close friend's university in Japan. However, the application has been weird (does not appear as an actual year), and because of that I did not know that this was an option for a year long program, nor did I know that I would need to find two professors to recommend me. I just have to type in their emails so I may technically be able to add them in. Because of this, I may not be able to study abroad at my friend's university like I wanted.

I am also considering transferring back to my original university. There are many things that this university offers that I like. My friend group here was also really good and we all had similar interests too. I liked this university more, and it offered many classes and majors that all interested me. My health problems have ended now, so I should not have a problem going back. However, this means sacrificing the year I wanted to spend abroad. I might still be able to do a semester, but I do not know. There is also the problem of how all the credits are going to transfer as well and if they actually decide to give me my scholarship back (can not afford to attend without the scholarship).

I feel like all of my efforts have been for nothing. I've lost my scholarship. I could have gotten my tuition paid had I gone to the in-state university in the first place. I likely won't be able to study abroad with my friend. I feel like I missed out on my one opportunity to have this kind of meaningful experience that I was looking forward to. I know that it's possible to work abroad, but I'm just worried that the experience won't be the same.

242,skybluesky_,1582613690,/r/college/comments/f96ake/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_with_my_life/,"My parents are really smart. Both went to Ivy League schools. I somehow didn't inherit their intelligence but I went to a competitive high school and was able to pull off a decent ACT score and get into BU (after my parents proofread everything on my common app). But now here I am, a sophomore STEM major, and I don't really think I can handle it. My GPA is just hovering right around a 3.0 and I don't want to give up on my classes. But I keep getting Ds in classes everyone says are the easier ones and I just feel like I really can't do it. Some people have to be weeded out. The issue is that if I tried to switch now there's no way I'd be able to graduate in two years like I planned and I can't afford to go here longer than I have to. I'm not a hard worker but my major is decently interesting and there's no other major I'd rather do here anyway. I've also lived in the Boston area for my entire life and most of my friends and family live here or pretty nearby, but none of my family is from here and I deeply feel like an outsider. I'm dying to move somewhere else, but I have no idea how I'd afford it or where I'd go because I have no idea what career I want or could get after college (I'm not premed). I barely know anyone who lives in other cities so I'm terrified of being lonely and I have no experience with moving, but I just feel like I'm deeply not a New Englander. Honestly I don't really have much faith in getting a job after college. BU seems to be decently hard to get a good GPA, but still. I feel like it's hard to compete with people who have a better GPA. Also, my younger sister has dyslexia and my family might move so we can afford for her to go to private school. I know I'm so immature and selfish to be sad about this and this is what she needs, but secretly I've been fearing it so much since I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life and a lot of my best friends are still from my high school and it'd be hard to see them much again (I go home for breaks). I'm also in my first relationship and my boyfriend is way more into it than me which really freaks me out, but I can't bring myself to end it even if honestly some of the reason I'm still dating him is just to finally have a boyfriend and not be my stupid self people have looked down on my whole life (I do like him in the ways I should to some extent, which complicates things further). I'm worried long term I'll never be able to commit to someone and legitimately want to spend all my time with them more than anyone else since I like hanging out with a group of friends the most, but at the same time I want to get married and not be alone my whole life. I'm doing way too much stuff- balancing schoolwork with three clubs (no leadership), exercise, a volunteer position, an on campus job I can choose my hours for, trying to apply for summer internships I likely won't get, my relationship, seeing a bunch of friends that aren't all friends with each other, and still seeing my family semi-regularly/helping with my ten year old sister since I'm not very far from home. And I have terrible time management skills so I waste half the day away when it's incredibly important. I know I need to quit something, but there's nothing I can really quit. Here it is, almost 2 AM, I'm trying to make up the hours I said I did for my job last week, I flaked on my boyfriend today, and I have an 8AM chem lab tomorrow I haven't done the prelab for or last week's postlab. I just failed my orgo exam I crammed for and I'll have to lie to all my smart friends in the class as usual so they don't know how stupid I really am. I don't even know what I'll tell my parents. The worst part is that I know these are all such first world problems and I was given so much opportunity that I don't deserve when a lot of people don't get to go to college (I sound like such a shitty person in this but I really do care about other people and I see myself as worse than the average person), and I'm going to throw this expensive tuition away my parents are killing themselves to pay for away and never get a job and live with them until they die and then who even knows. I might seem like I have low self esteem, but I think I have reason to. I was born without any real talents in an area of success and I don't belong here at all. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for going on and on and this is probably normal for a 19 year old to be unsure of their future, but I just feel like I'll be a total failure (you can probably tell by now interviews aren't going to save me). If anyone has any idea of how I could possibly turn any aspect of my life around, that would be much appreciated.

243,JadeGreenleaves,1581817026,/r/college/comments/f4jfc1/im_running_out_of_money_for_college_what_should/,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit, so I apologize for any mistakes. Also, this is going to be a long post, so bear with me!

Here's my situation:

I'm a 20 y/o college student on my 4th semester. I currently live on campus with my twin sister. Our parents make too much money for FAFSA to offer us any aid besides small loans but they cannot afford to put any money towards our education. This mean we're paying out of pocket for the entirety of our expenses. 

We lived at home our first semester and worked almost full time while taking a full course load. I'm working toward my BFA, which requires a huge amount of studio time outside of class. By the time I would get out of class and home for the night, I'd have no time to work on my projects before I had to be awake at 3:30am for work, then school the next day. This situation was greatly reducing my academic performance and extremely stressful. Work was very understaffed so I got a ton of hours. Despite the stress, I was able to make and save a lot of money.

Since then, we've been sharing a room on campus in the cheapest available housing. We come home on the weekends to work, so we have a fraction of the hours. Living on campus has been an absolute necessity for me as I need access to programs, materials, and studio space that I only have on campus. I spend around 27 hours a week (9 per studio class, I'm taking 3) outside of class, which is standard for art courses. 

This setup has been great for my schoolwork, but horrible on my finances. This year has been full of unexpected expenses. For example, I suddenly lost a $1000/sem scholarship due to taking under 15 credit hours this semester. This was something I wasn't warned about and hadn't been enforced or mentioned until this semester.

The nature of my degree is extremely expensive as well. I've spent almost 2k in supplies and framing this year alone. I would have been able to manage this if it hadn't been for the loss of my scholarship. 
I will also need a car in the near future. I share one with my twin right now, which makes having a separate job/life complicated.

My current job is my first out of high school. I've been a great employee, and my boss has worked around my school schedule. However, I only make $8.75/hr which isn't sufficient to pay my expenses. A substantial raise is highly unlikely as the business is small and family owned (not my family). We are no longer understaffed, which means will have reduced hours this summer, which I cannot afford.

I need a higher paying job, but I don't know of one that will work around my schedule once summer ends.

I don't know what to do from here. I'll barely be able to pay for this semester, but I have no idea what to do in the fall. 

I've worked extremely hard to get this far and I don't want to give up. I'm passionate about my major and I've kept a 4.0 gpa despite everything. I'm worried taking a semester off will set me back and may sever my connections. 

I'm frustrated to be in this situation. I worked hard through high school to get good grades and a good ACT score, I've kept a perfect GPA through college, I have a job and go to the cheapest school in the state. Despite everything I still can't afford school. I'm not giving up, but it's crucial I make the best decisions I can moving forward. 

Does anyone have any advice? I'm open to any options you guys can think of. I've been avoiding taking out a private loan because I'm trying to graduate with as little debt as possible. At this point, it may be worth it.

* Securing employment
* Finding a place to live
* Covering tuition

The first point may not be an issue for me since I work for BiteSquad and they can likely transfer my employment to the city the college is in.

But housing is an issue, because student housing at this school is given to transfers LAST, and rent in the city is astronomical, even when splitting rent. I see no feasible way to afford the latter on the salary I’m making right now. Student housing of course is expensive as shit too

And then there’s tuition. I’ve already done the FAFSA, but previous experience tells me that my Pell grant will barely be enough to cover that along with textbooks.

248,TheLordOfCheesez,1579030032,/r/college/comments/eoq11b/eeb_to_jewelry_a_serious_degree_change/,"Hello reddit! 

I’m a 22 year old, currently working as a Jeweler.

A little history first...

I have about 30 credits worth of community college classes under my belt; Mostly Gen Eds. I was originally going to transfer to an Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology program to get a Bachelors of Science, and my GPA was a 3.7 before I took a serious hit during a summer semester. By the end of 2018 I was at a GPA of 3.3.

I stopped going to classes last year (2019); instead, I went to New Approach School for Jewelers in TN, and completed their graduate bench jewelers program, alongside another one week comprehensive class. I spent the rest of the year focusing on improving my jeweler skills.

It was definitely a productive year, but I have this sort of ache to want to continue with my college studies...and a sadness that I’m behind my graduating high school class (most of them graduated last year). 

Its tough, though, because I don’t know if I should even continue with my EEB plan...I will likely be working as a jeweler for the rest of my life. Not that I have a problem with that; I just want to pursue a degree that will make my jeweler career much more worthwhile, especially if I take over the business I’m currently working at with my partner in the future. 

So, my question now; what degree/major choice would be better suited to my current situation? 

I was thinking of trying to apply to an art school nearby and focus on their Jewelry Design program, but they’re incredibly expensive, and I’ve heard plenty of remarks about art schools not being worth it. 

My state uni is still also an option, and I was considering their business / administration degrees, but I have no idea if I’d be any good at something like that...I’ve always been the artsy designer, and hands-on type.

I suppose what I would want to get out of the degree, is to increase my overall skill set, make connections in this industry, and maybe even get the chance to travel and observe jewelry and art all around the world. 

I am definitely gearing up for GIA classes in the future, which will likely help me with this, but I do want to supplement those classes with a degree, too. 
Especially since neither of my parents ever got a degree; that’s a huge motivator for me. 

I guess I’m just at a bit of a standstill. I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts!",college,EEB to Jewelry; a serious degree change?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eoq11b/eeb_to_jewelry_a_serious_degree_change/,1579048032.0

I'm transferred as a junior and am now in a 4 year university and I have 3 semesters left. I really enjoy the classes I'm taking (for the most part) and I'm learning a lot of stuff that I definitely wouldn't have learned if I didn't go to the school I'm currently at. But there's a growing anxiety and an obvious problem -- getting a job/finding ways of making money. I'm getting really worried about making money, as I want to move out of my state soon after I finish my degree (hopefully to somewhere less expensive, I can't move back in with my parents because there's no space left for me, plus it's a pretty stressful home life). 

In short, I have no fucking idea how to go about making money or getting a job, especially in the music industry. I'm trying to make connections but I don't know anyone in the industry and don't like the idea of making friends only to possibly secure a potential job in the future. I'm friends with a few people and I'm generally more reserved. I know I have to break out of this before I end my time at my college or else I'm screwed. 

I'm considering teaching as I'm fairly well trained and can explain things in an interesting (and non-boring) way, possibly tutoring. I'm very passionate about music, music history, and everyone I talk to about music (who wants to hear it) says the same thing and that I'd be a good teacher. But I really don't know what to do other than that, and I'm not really thrilled about my prospects. I'd love to just put my music up online and whoever would like to buy it can do so, hopefully amass a good side income, but this is just too much to ask for in today's music buying culture.

I really feel like I might have made a mistake in majoring in music, even though I love it with my entire being. Maybe I'm just venting, maybe something will happen and I will all of the sudden meet someone or get a good paying job. I don't know. Sorry about rambling, I'm just very nervous.

I grossly underestimated the difficulty of these classes, was determined not to drop and finish the semester strong, and stupidly didn’t drop and failed all 4 classes. 

Four years later and I’ve completed a total of two classes. I’ve enrolled in two more and had to drop them for two semesters in a row. Now I’m more than likely going to fail and be suspended from school because I didn’t drop like I should have and my GPA’s a 1.4.

I was very intimidated by this school and decided to not apply since I thought my work was not good enough. Now, looking back, I was an idiot and should have applied there in the first place, I would have been accepted and had been able to do my schooling there. 

For context, I go to an art college and took a year off after my first year due to my poor mental health, since returning (ive done 3 semesters since), I've been feeling extremely depressed again, and I think that a huge portion of it is because I'm unsatisfied with my experience at my current school. I've lost friends since I returned (for no good reason), and since my school is so small, it's extremely cliquey with a minimal social scene, and no real opportunities to get out and take a break from my studies. I'm a commuter (since it is very expensive to dorm) with a very long commute from out-of-state. I find that after class I am too tired to do anything, even when it comes down to getting my work done. I'm losing my motivation to continue and its been impacting my grades. I do know that my depression won't disappear by me being accepted to this other school, but being able to dorm while having a range of opportunities offered by a larger school may help me in the long run. I did dorm at my current school once and it was my best semester, academically, but even then, I felt that I wasn't doing enough with myself. 

I'm staying at my current college for the next semester, and hope to apply and get accepted to the other school for their upcoming fall semester. I am going to intern and take classes over the summer to fill in credits and keep my grades up. Unfortunately, due to my shit time management during my first semester, I have an extra semester at this school, which is leaving me to graduate a year later than I should.

Right now it’s looking like I’ll get somewhere between a 2.8-3.0 gpa at the end of the term, 
I learned today that one of my classes (that I currently have an A in) only counts as a pass/fail class, and is not calculated into account for my gpa. (Or if it is, could someone explain ?)

That spiraled into a full blown panic attack, two hours of tears, and questioning whether or not I should shift my career focus and change majors. On top of that, I’m out of state and need a 3.25 gpa by the end of the spring to maintain my scholarship. Both of my parents are now working full time to keep me here on top of my $11,000 /yr scholarship and I feel like I’m letting them down. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m going to work my butt off on my finals but the fear of failure on top of my testing anxiety is freaking me out. My experience in high school did not prepare me for college whatsoever- coming out of HS with multiple honors and a 3.8 gpa I thought I was smart and would do well in college, but now I’m thinking I’m too stupid to be here. 

On top of this stupid gpa dilemma, this semester is the first time in my life where I’ve dealt with mental health issues. I’ve made two very great friends here, but throughout the semester I’ve experienced anxiety attacks, complete social isolation, and several week-long depression episodes. They offer on-campus mental health services, but unfortunately therapy here is not only expensive, but also has very long waiting lists. I don’t have a car with me, and don’t have access to other providers that could potentially help. This semester has turned into a repetitive cycle of constant studying, testing, unideal exam scores resulting in sadness/anxiety, and burnout. 

I don’t want this rocky semester to negatively impact the rest of my time here. I also don’t want to quit my current major, but if it means taking something less difficult with a higher chance of getting a better gpa, I’m willing to do so.

255,ratfrances,1573624123,/r/college/comments/dvn8km/is_transferring_my_freshman_year_a_bad_decision/,"I am currently a freshman at a large, out of state school. The main reason why I chose here was because it’s known for being a STEM school, and had a major that I was interested in (that wasn’t offered at any other schools I initially looked into). However, I ended up realizing that math/science isn’t my thing, and have decided on a different major to pursue. The thing is, there’s nothing really keeping me at this school.  It’s too expensive. I’ve realized that I’m really not interested in the whole “big college experience” of football games and Greek life. And I absolutely hate the city I live in now. Not only is it just a very mediocre, unexciting place to live, it’s also not a very safe city, especially the area where my university is situated. I’ve had multiple incidents leaving me feeling unsafe walking around the city, which is difficult considering I don’t have a car, and simply don’t want to be restricted to staying on campus 24/7. This just isn’t somewhere I’m looking forward to spending another 3 1/2 years at. Overall, I didn’t choose this school for all the right reasons, didn’t do enough research beforehand, and never even toured the school before deciding on here. 

So, about a month into the semester I decided to look around at different schools. And I found a college that I ended up being really interested. It has multiple degree programs I’m interested in (just in case this next major I switch to ends up also not being of interest to me), it’s a smaller school, and it’s located in one of my favorite places in the world. In addition, the school has taken into account my family’s difficult financial situation (which my current school did not), therefore they’re offering me a generous financial aid scholarship, making tuition substantially cheaper than the school I’m at right now. I’ve spent the past two months emailing with advisors/department heads there, done a ton of research, and even went and toured the campus in person. I really believe this is the right school for me. So, I’m planning on transferring there for Spring 2020.

I’ve faced a little scrutiny for this. People have told me to give my current school more time (when there’s really nothing keeping me here), or that transferring mid year would be too much of a pain (so far the process has been pretty organized and simple). Besides, my new school is only 40 minutes over the mountains from my current school, so it’s not like I’m going somewhere crazy far away. I just figured might as well get the transferring process done with now, especially since there’s certain classes I’ll need to start taking there, that my current school doesn’t offer. I just want to get some more opinions on this- does this seem like the right decision, or am I crazy for transferring after only one semester?

I am a freshman at Ohio State University, who is from NJ.  I feel like I did not look into the school enough, because even in orientation in July I was having second thoughts about going here.  I thought it was just the nerves of being away talking, so I shook it off.  However, as time passed by, the glamor of the school wore off, and I felt a change mentally that I’ve never felt before.  Ive been extremely unhappy no matter what was going on, since September and I cannot see myself being here for 4 years.  In addition, I have to book and pay for flights that are just too expensive, but I want to go home for special occasions. I don't want to spend my time working over the summer and during schools just for overpriced flights.  Between finances and my mental health, I decided early that I’d like to make the decision to transfer to an in-state school as soon as possible so I did not fall behind.  College is college no matter where you go, and I don’t think the stresses of travel, finances, and distance are worth anything this school has to offer me personally that I cannot get in NJ.


So, I have a choice to make.  One school I’m interested in is Rutgers, it was a very close choice initially between there and Ohio, and they are similar in prestige.  However, the major I’d like to be in (Business Analytics) is in their business school, and I can only apply into their Arts and Sciences school and would be an Information Technology and Informatics Major.  On the flip side, I am extremely familiar with the school.  Both of my sisters attended the school so for the last 10 years I have been exposed to everything about it and I like it.  I would also be saving some money.


Then, there’s Rowan University, a significantly less prestigious school, but I was accepted into the major I wanted and given a very favorable scholarship, along with the fact that all of my credits transfer so I would not be behind. I would also have some good friends who go there.  However, their business program seems weak for the time being but they are heavily investing into it and are on the rise.


With these two drastically different options I’m looking at, which would you take? I’m aware its ultimately my choice, but if anyone has any experience in this spot, I’d love to hear about it.

264,emmyhikes,1571145649,/r/college/comments/di7t7q/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_its_not_just_a_good/,"I'm a first year university student in Canada. I decided to stay in my home city for school to save some money, but I hate it here. I never wanted to go to this university in the first place, and I started the year knowing that my program isn't perfect for me, but I figured I'd make it work. Turns out that my major just isn't for me at all, but there's only one program at my current school that I could switch into that better suits my interests (still nowhere near perfect though), and I would have to wait until next fall to switch. So, in the meantime, I would spend the next year taking a whole bunch of courses that I really don't like/have any interest in, and might not do as well in as a result.

My parents know that I want to switch programs and that I'm not happy with my school, and they encouraged me to look into other programs at my school, but also into programs at other schools out of town. Well, I found the PERFECT program, at a school I've always had a lot of interest in. I've spoken to a bunch of students in the program, and I know a few people at the school, and it just feels like the right choice. Plus, I could transfer right away, and start in January 2020, and with careful maneuvering of courses, still graduate on time! However, there are a few issues: 1) it's out of town, which means it'll be expensive and I'll have to get a part-time job during the school year (which is fine, I'll just have to manage my time really well), and 2) it's halfway across the country (2 hr flight, or 17 hr drive), so I'd be pretty far from family and friends back home (but it would also be a really cool experience, and I know I'd really thrive on my own). Looking into this program made me realize how much I'm missing out on/how unhappy I am at my current school, and seeing that things could be better and that I could have a fun four years... I've only been at my current school a couple of months, and I forgot that university's supposed to be fun, too, not *just* academics.

I feel really conflicted. My parents only have enough money saved up for my education to cover 4 years of undergrad in town (or 2-3 years out of town), but if I work two jobs in the summer and one part-time during the school year, I would be able to cover the cost of an undergrad out of town, but I would have little to no money saved up by the end of it. I'm planning to go to medical school after my degree, which I know will put me in debt, and it would be nice to minimize that debt. But I can't get this program out of my head, and I don't want to settle for something that will make me unhappy. I feel like I'm letting my parents down by going far from home, and by spending so much money. I originally wanted to go out of town for university, and accepted an offer even further away, but they made me feel pretty guilty about it, so I ended up accepting my offer at the university in town instead. Plus, my older sister stayed in town for university even though she hates her school (but she loves her program), and she's graduating this year with quite a bit of money.

I don't know if I should just stay at my school and switch programs next fall, or switch to the other university. I just want to be happy and have a good 4 years studying something I'm interested in.

It’s only about the 4th week and I feel like I’m too behind to ever really pass these classes. In HS I always did well in these classes and did lots of AP, but here I am, a future engineer who can’t even pass the first few weeks of calculus. I had only planned to be an engineer, I can’t think of another field that interest me, and even if I did I’d have to transfer.

I was really excited to complete my major (International Studies/ Relations), but the classes seem so pointless and uninteresting now.

I'm more focussed on my volunteering job at my local fire station and getting ready to leave for the military after college (Running. swimming, lifting etc). These are the only things that really interest me anymore. I've noticeable been getting in better shape and it's become such a fun hobby to pursue and learn more about the science behind it. It's been the biggest thing reducing my stress about school.

It's not like I feel depressed or sad, because I know what that feels like, I just have lost interest. I really only can stand one of my classes which is a US Foreign policy class with a great professor and then I tolerate Spanish because it's semi interesting.

I think the main turnoff is how stupid I feel in these classes and how pointless the material seems. Just writing this out now I'm realizing it's one class that is giving me the biggest issue. The people in the class are pretentious and the professor lectors like they're giving a sermon. I think I could solve a lot of my stress by not being in this class but I'd have to replace it with something else. And I already dropped a previous language and replaced it with Spanish because it was causing me too much stress.

I just feel awful because my parents are covering my tuition in full and I regret going to an expensive private university instead of a cheaper in state school. I'm not even going to use my major until after the military, or maybe not ever if I pursue fire fighting.

269,marble-faun,1569343645,/r/college/comments/d8pul9/transferring_out_of_school_to_community_college/,"So I’m a sophomore (F19) and I’m leaving my university to go to a community college. The plan from there is to do two years (I could finish it in one, but I want to take my time and I’m thinking of double majoring while there and getting an associates degree) and then transfer to another four year university, maybe CSU Northridge for two years to get my bachelors. 

I’m leaving college mainly because of money. I got good financial aid, but the school is still very expensive. My parents are supporting me, and are doing so without taking out loans, but it’s getting harder and harder to do so. There have been a lot of set backs, like my mom getting thyroid cancer, my dad maybe having to retire soon, and my brother wanting to go to graduate school. 

I COULD stay at university if I really wanted to, but I kind of don’t. I’m not miserable here. I have my best friend, who I hang out with 24/7 and who I love dearly. But that’s it. I don’t really like my classes, I don’t have any other friends, no boys are into me, and (worst of all) this school really doesn’t seem to have much opportunity. I want to go into a film (I know, I know, it’s a very competitive industry) and this school promised me internships and connections. Second year in, and I’m quickly realizing that that’s a lie. Many seniors that I spoke to graduated without a single internship under their belt. Which is terrifying. 

Even though there’s a lot of reasons for why this is the right decision, I’m still afraid I’m making the wrong one — or a worse one, at least. I’m moving AWAY from SoCal, which isn’t great for someone who wants to go into film. I live in Silicon Valley, which is where my community college is. So there’s not much opportunity for film there really. 

I will be moving back to where my two best friends live, which will be nice because I’m going to hang out with them as much as I can. But I’m worried that I’ll still find the experience of community college too isolating. 

Honestly, I’m worried that I’m limiting myself somehow. I’m 19, and it seems everyone has done crazy shit but me. My best friend had her slutty year last year. She partied and had tons of boys into her. All I did was lose my virginity (a horrible experience btw) and, other than that, get ignored by boys :/ It feels like I missed out on having a wild and fun life. High school was also pretty boring for me too. I never really did much. Again, I just never really get noticed by people. 

I don’t know if transferring will only exacerbate this issue. Community college isn’t a place known for partying and meeting people and dating and so on. But I also don’t know what the alternative to be. 

Honestly, this might be a bit to existential for this sub, but I’m honestly just worried that my shitty time at college is indicative that I’m going to live a boring life. I don’t want to be a boring person, and I honestly think I’m a pretty friendly, interesting person. But it just seems to be everyone is living a far more interesting life than mine. Am I too young to be worrying about this? Are these supposed to be the most interesting years of our lives?

The school is close to NYC, which makes it helpful for internships. They are also an AACSB accredited. They offer BS-MBA Finance. Academically the school is excellent. The professors seem very knowledgeable about the courses. They are approachable, and they also know my name. The school also gave me the most scholarships. But this university is not my first choice because the buildings and classrooms look very outdated and old. The campus is too small; I see my friends five times every day. They are great, but I want to connect with other people also. These concern might be too shallow, but I believe that I am not only paying for college education, but also the college experience.

272,bamlaw,1568869244,/r/college/comments/d69a6p/frat_roommates/,"Long story short our college got mad at all the frats and sororities and took away their houses and gave them apartments on campus instead so that they’d have RA’s and other university staff monitoring them. 

My roommate and I have always lived in the apartment across the hall from one of their frat apartments. Apparently over the summer they had a housing mishap and switched us across the hall to the frat apartment. Me and him are both pretty introverted until we get to know people really well. I thought since they knew we weren’t in their frat they’d be nicer and would go to some of their other apartments (which they said they’d do). I was wrong. Very wrong. Every morning when I leave my room there’s at least 2 boys sleeping on our couch or our floor, usually more though. There’s also usually 5+ frat members or their girlfriends here all hours after 4 pm. Currently (almost 1 am) there’s around 15 in our living room. They usually stay till 2:30-3am and then either leave or sleep on our couch/floor. They basically get wasted every night and then pass out or walk home. Like I said me and my roommate are pretty introverted until we get to know people so for the past month and a half we’ve basically been like prisoners in our own room because anytime we go out there it’s 2+ new people in addition to the 15+ that we already don’t know. Because of this most of the time we just choose to stay in our room and talk to each other. We even put off meals and other things until we hear them leave momentarily when we can slip out without going through a throng or random boys. I haven’t ever even sat on my own couch or used my own kitchen because their stuff is always piled on top of everything or they’re all out there just staring me down when I walk through the living room to go anywhere. Also all their girlfriends are starting to stay too. One of them dropped out of school and now just sits around here all day watching TV and napping on our couch. I can’t use the washer/dryer because there’s always their bras and panties all over it or sitting inside it. Half the time the hot water is gone because the girlfriends take hour long showers when they wake up. We also have a zero tolerance alcohol policy at my university this year and they basically get shit faced every night and leave beer and liquor bottles all over our apartment. We could all be kicked out and pay a fine if they find the alcohol. 

I understand we are in their frat area and we aren’t members and they probably don’t want us here at all but at the same time we got moved here against our will and I called housing multiple times to no avail. It was basically go here or no housing for you and I can’t move off campus because they have age requirements to do that and I live too far away to say I’m a commuter. It’s also extremely expensive too and none of my state/fed scholarships would cover off campus. I’ve never wanted to be apart of any fraternity or anything of the sort so I guess I don’t even know if this is normal really???

We have a meeting tomorrow with the director of housing and I’m going to ask that we be allowed to move if there’s any open spaces in any other apartments no matter where they are on campus. He seems to think they’ll be able to talk to the boys and get them to be more cooperative. I worry though that if they say something the guys will hate us and make it even worse. We’re the only two who aren’t in their frat living here so if someone reports the room they’re going to know 100% that it was us who reported them. 

Some of my friends think we’re being dramatic while others I talk to think we should’ve been bitching housing out day 1.

It’s quite an expensive school but I have a scholarship that helps me save money. Money is a huge issue for many hopeful students who are trying to pursue an education. 

Let’s go back into my timeline, shall we? 

In high school, I had a 2.5 but I got into a public university. My parents were tight on money at the time so I decided to go to CC. It’s close to my house, like a 5 min drive. I also had friends who were going too. My first year was rough, I failed a few classes. It was because I was naive, I didn’t balance my schedule. I had friends who went to 4 year schools and invited me over to party. I feel into a deep depression (I don’t need sympathy). I decided to change my habits and study my ass off to achieve my Associates. I left CC with a 2.9 gpa and receive my associates. I did this by sacrificing my summer and taking classes to finish on time. 

I got into a Private 4 year University and decided to major in Sport Administration due to my passion in Soccer. I took a semester off to save more money and have a mental break. It was necessary because I really wanted to think about my goals in life. I wanted to be a scout but my path took me to somewhere greater. I got an internship with the New York Red Bull in event and operations (completely different than scouting lol). I learned so much about the professional job environment and made so many connections. They took a shot at me because of my passion, not really what was on paper. The point of an internship is to learn about the job environment, plus your supervisors and leaders get to learn about you. 

I was then offered a match day position and been with the operations department for about a year. I wanted more though, I wanted to continue to grow as professional. My advisor at Uni suggested to me that I apply for Madison Square Garden. It took me 3 months to achieve my internship there. One key value I learn is to be patient. I have such a tough time being anxious and worried about my future (it’s normal, I know I’m not the only one). My biggest take from this was, have a sense of communication. I asked questions that were critical thinking and showed my passion for the internship. But DONT BE ANNOYING. I try my best to be patient, I didn’t want to keep emailing every other day. Once a week is fine. 

I then went through 3 interviews and was offered a Front of House Operations Student Associate Internship. I was ecstatic, knowing my past, I was so proud of what I accomplished over the past 2 years. MSG saw that I worked hard over the last year. I volunteered with the NY Giants, NYC marathon, and ICC Championship. Volunteering looks so good on a resume, it shows how you’re willing to work for free for your passion. I showed to the interviewer my recommendations from my volunteering and Red Bull internship (Use them as a leverage during an interview, it looks good! I promise!). 

I saved so much money and I got to think about what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. I’m leaving with a 3.7 GPA at my University due to my new study habits and time management skills.  My goal is to run events, this is fueled by my passion of sports and concerts. My first event at MSG will be Tyler, The Creator (An artist I looked up to so much) looking at his past, he achieved so much for a kid that was once a shit head (just like myself lol). Tyler showed the world that he can be taken seriously because of his craft and love for creating. I look up to him as a role model, because of his inspiration, it made me chase my dreams. My first Tyler show was back in 2015 during The Cherry Bomb era. Now, I’ll be working at his concert at the Worlds Famous Arena (plus more events and sports). 

My advice for you is, find your passion. And find people who have the same passion as you. I worked even harder when the people around me are trying to chase the same dream. If you’re sad, depressed, or just not having that pure energy. Meditate, yeah meditate. Clear your head, breathing exercises helped me so much. DO YOUR RESEARCH. Look online, go on LinkedIn, Google, Forums, ANYTHING. Learn from others and see what you can do. I love feeling motivated by others. Learn about a professional on how they got from point A to point B, don’t just network for the job sake. 

Best of luck to anyone finding an internship, it can be hard. I got denied from Barclays Center, Prudential Center, and MetLife Stadium. Don’t let that slow you down if you didn’t get into your hopeful internship, get back up. Use your resources like a university career center by practicing interview skills and touching up resumes.

I am a freshman at Penn State and I am currently a ChemE major. I came here thinking I would not care about the distance from my friends and family back in Philadelphia but i do. I was hoping I would make friends and sort of move on from high school but I never realized how much I appreciated my friends. I am currently only 2 weeks into the fall semester but I also had a 7 week summer session that I was also unhappy and didn’t really meet anyone I really liked. I don’t want to seem like I’m giving up too easily but I’m depressed up here and get really sad whenever I think about how far away I am from the people I care about. I want to go to college in Philadelphia that has chemical Engineering and is not outrageously expensive. The only colleges that have chem e are drexel and u penn, and drexel is very expensive and u penn doesn’t seem like a good fit for me. So I am willing to give up chem e if i can find something at a philly college that I will still enjoy. My number one school is temple since it is cheap and some of my friends already go there. I have thought about industrial engineering, data science and other science/engineering degrees but I still don’t know if any of them are right for me. Most people would suggest mechanical or electrical but what little I really know about them I don’t think they are right for me.

280,_GoMe,1567049946,/r/college/comments/cwvig5/i_am_thinking_about_dropping_out_to_join_the_air/,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello. My name is Jackson. I am 18 years old, and just started a 4-year program to get a degree in aviation to go to the airlines. I've only been going to this college for 1 week. I'm not gonna lie, I kind of followed a friend to the college from our hometown 1000 miles away. I'm fitting in alright, I've made few friends here and there, but I just don't think that college is for me.

I come from a town in Montana. Beautiful mountains, tons of outdoors activities, and I love the town. I knew I wanted to do something that involves aviation, and I initially wanted to be an aerospace engineer. I did some research and turns out that going to uni to do that will get you a good career, but it's a lot of paperwork, and you don't really get to work on the aircraft/spacecraft. Anyways, a friend from my town convinced me to be a pilot so I followed him to Minnesota, 1000 miles away from home (half his family lives here, and I have some family nearby, so I kind of said 'sure, why not'). But now I am 1000 miles away from all my favorite activities, from all my family. And my friends. Two go to the college in Montana, one joined the USMC, and then there's me. Which brings me to my next point...

The kid who joined the USMC got me more and more interested in a career in the military. He talked about how if you wanted to go to college, they paid for it all. And also how there are tons of careers that you can succeed in, how you get a GI Bill, housing, etc. Initially, I was completely against the military as a whole. But this kid opened up my mind.

Speaking of the military paying for college, training, etc. flight college is NOT CHEAP. It will cost $200,000 to get a 4-year degree with all my certifications to go to the airlines, and I'm not 100% sure if this is what I really want to do. I know I would rather not be in debt, especially that much $. The whole process seems very bureaucratic and way more expensive than it should be. I know that I want to do something challenging, and even flying for an airline, but do I really want to go about it this way?

Also, classes just plain suck. I don't feel challenged at all. In high school, you were clearly told what to do and how to do it. I personally liked that; it was very organized and a good way to get my work done. Yea, I know that keeping track of it is part of being an adult and all but it is just a terrible transition for me. And with flying, you have to go to the airport several times a week (2 times assigned, 2 times unassigned flying) and because of how big the program is (tripled from last year) it might take longer just to complete the first ""flight lab"" (getting my private pilots license).

Finally, my last point. My parents are very supportive. They are helping pay for this semester of college, which alone costs $20k (This is the cheapest semester too. It's a state school!) My dad even asked me multiple times if I considered joining the military, but for some reason I just kept saying no and didn't even consider seeing a recruiter. Regardless, I'm afraid that if I call them up and say I want to drop out and join the Air Force after just a few weeks of college they might take it a weird way, by just telling me to stay and 'ride it out' and that it will get better.

I just don't know. I've only told one other person I've met so far that I am considering it, and he pushed for me not to go because his dad was in the military and killed people. I feel that serving my country is a duty deep down that I've always wanted to fulfill and that the Air Force has a lot more opportunities than this college will, with a lot of benefits (and risks). Traveling the world and being deployed in a new place is a new challenge that I think I would love to embrace. ***Please give me*** ***real*** ***feedback, I could really use the support.***

TL;DR: I've been going to college for a few weeks and might drop out to join the AF because I think I made a mistake coming here but I don't know how my parents and family would take it. Classes aren't challenging enough and I don't think this is the right path to lead a fulfilling life for me.",college,I am thinking about dropping out to join the Air Force...,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cwvig5/i_am_thinking_about_dropping_out_to_join_the_air/,1567067946.0

However, that was crushed after I found out that the admission fee, which you need to pay to gain a seat at the uni, was too expensive (I have a twin, so it was double the price). We have a lot of financial issues. I was able to land a really good scholarship, but I can't do anything without paying the admission fee. My family planned on having my sister and I study at home, but that's very difficult for the two of us since we either procrastinate or need someone to teach us. 
I feel like I'm missing out on an important part in my life. I even skipped prom since it was so pricey, that way we could save up cash for my university, but it was all in vain. So, college students, I wanted to know if missing out on college is a big deal or not? Am I over reacting?

282,mvch_elle,1566253040,/r/college/comments/csod38/is_transferring_three_times_too_much_in_college/,"I first graduated from hs and went to suny university at buffalo and I was in their Pharmacy Program. The first semester I did really bad and decided not to do Pharmacy anymore bc I wasn’t passionate about it and the courses would only get harder from there. The next semester I was undecided but leaning towards nursing so I took Anatomy and ending up dropping it bc I was falling behind and it was too difficult for me(I also didn’t have good study habits). I decided I still wanted to do something health care related but I had to leave buffalo bc my grades would only get worse there. So I went to CUNY city college for my second year just to pick up my grades before going to an even better college.(I should have just gone to community college) So I was able to pick up my grades there but my overall gpa was only about a 2.8. I realized if I want to do nursing, I can’t stay at city college bc they don’t have nursing and a lot of classes needed for nursing like nutrition and I still need to take anatomy and physiology ll(took anatomy and physiology 1 this summer) that they only offer in the spring semester. So during my spring semester I was looking for schools to transfer to but I didn’t consider suny schools bc I felt like I didn’t have a good chance of being accepted with my low gpa and on top of that I was thinking of doing nursing so I didn’t want to be accepted to a school and start for a year finishing up my prerequisites and not get into the nursing program. So I waited till summer(I know my fault) and the only schools offering nursing that still had admissions open in ny were CUNY York college and liu Brooklyn. I have heard more bad things than good about liu Brooklyn but they accepted me directly into their nursing program for fall 2019 which is nice so I can get on track to get a bsn degree. Liu Brooklyn is really expensive for my family rn considering my brother is also in college and soon my little brother. York College seems to have bad reviews as well but it’s a CUNY I don’t except much. I just wish they had dorming bc I cant seem to find someone looking for a roommate around there(i live in the Bronx so my parents rather me find a place near there than commute everyday). Im also leaning toward nursing but occupational therapy interests me as well so I’m torn. My other option is to go to community college for a semester and do the last of my prerequisites then apply to Stony Brook’s nursing program or another top nursing program in ny. But I’m wondering if it looks bad that I have been to so many undergraduate schools. Like if I apply to stony brook would they deny me bc I transferred too much or when I apply for a job would they need to know all the schools I attended or just where I got my degree from.  My last choice is to just take a semester off and really think of what I want to do and make a plan, also that way I would only have transferred two times.  But my parents really want me in school. I know this post is all over the place but I’m torn on whether to go to liu Brooklyn, York College, community college for a semester and apply to another school, or take a semester of and work then apply to another school earlier so I can really have time to do research and see what school is for me.",college,Is transferring three times too much in college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/csod38/is_transferring_three_times_too_much_in_college/,1566271040.0

284,marynarasauce,1565645786,/r/college/comments/cpj0tb/clothing_essentials_for_college/,"A lot of talk is going on about dorm room essentials and tips for college but I think clothing is very important in how you present yourself, how you budget, and how you feel at college. And that is something we have yet to talk about much in this subreddit. So I wanted to make a list of some things that may be useful to get when you start college (I’m speaking for females but males may find some of this useful):

• cardigan/jean jacket (GAP, H&amp;amp;M, J Crew, Old Navy) - every girl should have at least one cardigan to keep in their backpack in case a class gets chilly. They’re good to throw onto a plain or striped shirt to complete a fall outfit. 

• tennis shoes (Nike, Adidas, Puma, New Balance) - try to invest in a good pair because it will make all the difference in how well you work out. Tennis shoes will go with any outfit and they’re super comfortable to walk in around campus. 

• sandals (Chacos, Birkenstock, Filas) - investing in a good pair of sandals go a long way. They’re the easiest to put on cause you can just slip them on and not have to worry about washing your socks. Your feet feel fresh and free and if they are a good pair, your feet won’t hurt. I have had cheap target sandals which look really cute but after a lot of walking my feet get blisters. 

• workout shorts (Nike, UnderArmour, Adidas) - so versatile and comfortable: they can be worn to bed, in class, and to the gym. Makes it so much easier to get dressed cause you can wear these with any t shirt and it’ll go together perfectly. I recommend underarmour shorts because they have POCKETS. they’re just like Nike shorts but with large pockets for your phone and keys and the quality is still amazing. They’re cheaper too! Only $18 for a pair on Amazon. 

• basic tees (UNIQLO, Target, Hanes, Amazon) - always a go-to for a chill day of class and if you want to dress it up, throw on a necklace... if you are feeling cold, throw on a cardigan. I recommend getting neutral colors like white, tan, brown, and dark green.

• rain boots/umbrella/raincoat - I recommend getting a rain jacket from Charles River and I found a cheap pair of Chelsea rain boots on amazon for $15 and they are super durable and cute. And as for umbrellas I recommend those small ones that extend when you open it so that you can keep it in your backpack bottle holder when you’re not using it

• A nice hoodie with a pocket (Champion, Hanes, Nike) I swear that pocket will save you and that hoodie will be your favorite article of clothing to wear in class during the winter

• sweatpants (Nike, Adidas, Baleaf, Lululemon) - something you can wear at home or in your dorm to sleep and head to class without changing. Try to find some with pockets. I especially like those adidas track pants with the zippers on the *giant* pockets and down the ankle. They’re expensive for a college budget but trust me they’re worth it and last a long time. 

• flannel - works like a cardigan but a little more suitable for summer 

• lanyard - you can find these anywhere so find one that expresses you well and keep your keys and perhaps an ID holder on it.

• water bottle (s’well, hydroflask, contigo) - not really clothing but it’s something that you should remember to carry on you. Some of these brands have new member discounts and S’well has a student store that you can access with discounts. If you want a hydroflask, keep in mind that you should find the standard mouth sizes so that they can fit in your side pockets instead of those giant ones you have to lug around by hand. Swell has very cute designs but hydroflask only has basic colors... that doesn’t mean it can’t be fixed a little sticker magic though!

• cap - not really an essential but I feel like every college student should have a cap in case of football games or outdoor events that get sunny. It’s a good opportunity to get a collegiate cap and show your school spirit!

Now keep in mind this is not a packing list and just some ideas for clothing items that aren’t so obvious. Some of the brands I listed are just my personal preference and I know it may not be feasible for the average student budget but some things are worth the money. There are so many ways to get a cheaper price on these things too so I recommend to check their websites for student discounts and daily deals on certain things. [Link to a complete list of discounts you can get for just being a student](https://www.retailmenot.com/blog/college-student-discounts.html) this list includes Nike, Champion, ASOS, UnderArmour, etc. Another way to save money is to get your free trial of amazon student prime for 6 months (after that I believe it’s $7/month) and buying your clothes there. Some prices are cheaper there including underarmour shorts and everything will be shipped in one box most likely which will save the earth. Just learn to check for any deals and make sure you’re not getting a 3rd party manufactured item.

My second daughter (18) is going to go to a much cheaper school, at least half the price of the other one. Her school highly suggested getting a long term, low interest student loan administered by a state agency. It requires a co-signer. This same loan is available to my first daughter.

If I apply again, that means I will have one more year before going to college. Since I have already graduated from high school, this means I would have to through a gap year. So, during the gap year, what kind of things I can do?

So, for years I explored and tried different things. In my first year of high school I took an engineering class and decided it wasn't right for me, then realized I should probably stick to the things that I'm good at, which are more art based. I love to write and I'm working on a book, but I'm not expecting good money off of it. It's hard to make enough to live with a book. I continued to explore things I like doing until I finally decided I want a film degree. It's perfect for me since it is artistic, a way of storytelling and mixing aesthetics. An impressive shot from a movie can make me swoon more than any attractive actor can. Obviously I want to be a director, but who doesn't? Realistically, I want to work on ad campaigns for fashion companies (kinda like those gorgeous Dior ads that have nothing to do with the actual product, but they're really pretty and convey moods and make you want to buy it anyway, if that makes sense). 

Sorry if that was a lot/annoying but I wanted to give some background before I talk about this issue. I really wanted to go to film school. I know film is a thing that can be ""self-taught"" and you don't really need to go to school (trust me I've read those forums) for it, but I am the kind of person that learns best when I am being instructed and/or have an organized way of learning something. I've been trying to write a book for like 5 years and it's hard enough, I don't know how I could handle teaching myself a whole new thing you know. I also want access to equipment and connections. I currently live in South Carolina and there are no film schools around. None. There's one in Atlanta, GA but it's not a great school and it's really hard to find reviews and honest feedback about it. Cali is too far, so I've set my eyes on New York. I grew up in Jersey so I'm rather familiar with NY and I have family and friends up there. I'm going to be a senior in high school this year, and my GPA, rank, classes, extracurriculars, etc. are all great. I'm not worried about whether I can get in or not, I probably can, but here it is: WHY THE FUCK IS COLLEGE SO EXPENSIVE???? I literally have no other ""cheap back up schools"" because I can't find any with film degrees. Even if I were to find some, I doubt I could make great connections and get a job. I am SURE this is the only thing I want to major in. Nothing else, and I have done hard research and exploring, appeals to me. Writing is my passion, but I don't want to be an English teacher or write articles for a living. I also know how to write, so why would I get a degree in Creative Writing if I can already successfully creatively write?

293,Meerywednesday,1561407720,/r/college/comments/c4uz1i/get_a_job_to_pay_for_school_or_compromise_on/,"Hey,

I was hoping for some advice on this issue as I can’t make up my mind and have to make a decision by the 28th.

Long story short, I am a junior transfer student coming out of community college. Within this last year, I discovered I really liked filmmaking along with its various aspects (editing, effects etc.) and want to go into a field like television, or if that didn’t work out, maybe something more realistic like advertising or PR.

I applied to a bunch of schools these last two semesters, and after filtering out some that I didn’t feel worked for me, it’s come down to three. One is U of Michigan, one is Ithaca and the last is UT Austin.

The issue is that Michigan’s film/tv program isn’t  too well known, not as production based, and doesn’t have as many resources as the other two. (When I applied last year, I was likely less concerned about my major until I received my decision, then I deferred until this year). But they’re giving me a lot of aid, and I’d be out in two years with only ~26k in debt. However, Austin, which has what I want, and where I really wanted to go to, is pretty unaffordable (54k a year for OOS) and I would have to work about 20 hours a week for a year in order to gain residency so it would be affordable. Ithaca is third in line to the other two as it’s a bit expensive (43k after two years) and I’m not sure it’s definitely for me, though their program is more TV oriented and has a lot of internships.

My question is:
Would it be better to compromise and enroll in a school where my major isn’t prioritized (no advertising/PR courses either) or should I bite the bullet and work 20 hrs a week for a year to afford where I really want to go?

I guess what I’m most worried about with the working side is not having much of a social life or even time to do my HW. 

I’d appreciate any advice. I feel like I’m obsessing about this constantly, and this feels like such a big, daunting decision. Any advice would be much appreciated.

296,oaksblog,1560233825,/r/college/comments/bz8w6g/having_trouble_choosing_a_major/,"Hello, I am having trouble choosing a major (obviously everyone does). I think that is, is because I truly don't know who I am, to know what career I want. I am a junior (spoiler, I one of those who is taking 6 years to get a degree, but have had some hardships too that caused me to push school longer, haven't we all). Another thing I believe too is, I went to a community college first, which is fine for getting the gen ed credits out of the way, but I was way too focused and didn't really get to see what I truly liked. I have taken eng, hist, business, graphic design, math, bio, psych, comm, anthro, photography, astronomy, criminal justice, etc. I did enjoy graphic design, anthropology, and criminal justice. One thing though that I have been more so afraid of is going in class such as eng or history. Just so much stress over the years that is has started to mess with my memory. I want to get into something that isn't in those senses how in eng and history you have to memorize so many things. I tend to be better at more so the visual or math (still can be visual or just numbers). I did enjoy anthropology, criminal justice, graphic design. One thing also is that I believe I have both sides of my brain working on me when it comes to maybe what I want to do. I have the artistic need coming from one, as well as the sciences and maths coming in the other. I also don't want to continue to have to go even longer just for a bachelors degree, so that is making it harder on me. And the thing to is I am stuck between going to a university vs a state college. One where I could join clubs, but is a but more expensive (I still have 2 vs 3 scholarships) or go to a state college and it be cheaper. I am also a bit on an introvert, but have gotten better over the years, but would prefer a job that doesn't constantly deal with people all the time. I am fine with clients or such, but would prefer not such. I am just trying to find a major that best fits me, even if it isn't 100% my passion, but at least I like it and am good at it.

I have like 70 or 80 something credits from dual credit and the classes I took here. I was also going to transfer before the spring semester began, but I for some reason just never finished the paperwork. I had a lot of anxiety about leaving and I juet kinda freaked out and stayed. 

Why I want to transfer: the atmosphere here isn't good. Almost everyone has mental illness, we had 5 suicides in 3 years, and it isn't a good situation for me to be in personally. I had to take a semester off. The offices are hard to get in contact with and the processes for dealing with financial aid, registrar, etc are very draining and the people that work there are generally rude, and that's a consensus from everyone I know not just me. The classes are harder than they should be, and I know for sure because people that have transferred agree that the classes here are too unreasonably hard. It's hard to get straight answers from anybody and there aren't enough professors for students, so as a psych major I almost didn't even get to register for any psych classes for next semester. The weather is dreary and I don't like the town, but those aren't really super important. 

Why I'm scared to transfer: Cost is a big one. A really big one. Also, time it will take to finish my undergrad. I want to (endgoal) be a doctor, so adding too many years to undergrad is daunting. Friends, I just joined a coed fraternity last semester and I have just now started making friends out of it and out of other areas on campus and if I lwave I would have to start all over. I'm in a lease starting in July that I would need to get out of, and then figure out a place to live at the new school (dorms are too expensive). I wouldn't have a job, but I have 2 here.

I really don't know what to do. I'm so unhappy but the reasons to stay feel like they're too much. I keep getting told that it's a ""sunken cost fallacy"" and I shouldn't put too much weight on how much I've put in here and I shouldn't feel stuck and it's okay to transfer, but I do feel stuck.

Sadly, i was kicked out of the engineering program because i failed two classes my very first semester. I blame my terrible work ethic, procrasination, my really rowdy roommates, my severe lack of sleep and 8ams every day. But of course i mostly blame myself

getting kicked out of the engineering program was tough. It was the only major i was interested in. Everything else sounded terrible. I made an attempt at the reconsideration process to get back into engineering but gave up because i had finally realized i dont have the mental stamina for engineering. My pride got the best of me here. I should have gave up a long time ago. At least the engineering department advisers were supportive.

I became awfully depressed, thought about killing myself a lot, couldnt concentrate on anything and felt like i was never getting enough sleep. 3 semesters of university like this.  By the end of my sophomore year, my parents told me i should transfer out of the university to attend a college back home. My grades were shit, i didnt know what i wanted to major in anymore, and university was expensive. I knew they were right so i went through with it and transferred to a community college last fall. I probably wouldnt have been able to overcome my depression if i hadnt done this but i wonder sometimes how i would have done at my last college if i wasnt so depressed. I also managed to drastically improve my work ethic here.

But community college is really easy. I have a 3.9 gpa right now, doing computer science and am really enjoying it, but i feel like im barely being prepared for anything. Its literally like high school. Im making the best of this to get my grades up, retook a lot of classes, but i still feel ashamed and disappointed in myself. I want to transfer out of here so bad.

I would like to transfer but i was told thats risky cause then the college i transfer to will choose what credits apply and dont apply.   Hopefully by then, i can finally transfer to somewhere near by ( i live in nyc).

301,overwhelmed-student,1557288021,/r/college/comments/bm0ndd/i_was_planning_on_transferring_and_recieved_a_c/,"Sorry if this is a detailed post, but I'm genuinely floored on what to do here.



I had completed 2 semesters of college at a 4 year university before this, with a 3.76 GPA, honors college, etc. Even though I have autism, ptsd, GAD, amd ADHD, I got on meds, therapy, worked hard over breaks to learn what I wasn't taught in high school (like higher math) and have generally just been busting my ass for school.



I had attempted Calculus 2 for science and engineering majors once, the summer after my first semester. I withdrew due to a death in my family. I was told at my 4 year by advisors in my department (Computer Science) at our orientation to take Calc II at the local community college, they even readied the forms for us to enroll there immediately. My school publishes grade distributions, and hardly 40% pass calc 2 at my school. Naturally, I signed up at the community college.



I had no idea how disasterous the course would be. My professor was really disorganized, had never taught there before, and was very very strict on grading ( minus 5 if you forget + C, or write u before you plug in the original value for the integral and evaluate) I saw many classmates struggle, but I think some of them did well despite no curve. I got 60's and 70's on homework regardless of utilizing tutoring, having my answers checked by the tutors, etc. I could do the problems, but would make a minor mistake and lose 10 points.



I went to office hours almost daily, and was the only one who ever attended, I was very friendly and close with the professor. I really did try my best. I just couldn't perform to the professor's expectations. Now, I have a dilema. I cannot attend my 4 year school anymore, because it is too expensive, I don't get enough fin aid. They also don't have my intended major, Neuroscience, or any courses in it. I want to double major in Neuro and CS.



I sent out several transfer applications, but I know even if I am accepted, I will likely be rescinded because I got a C. Calc II is a pre-req for a few of the CS, Neuro, or Computational Neuroscience programs that I applied to. My cummulative GPA has now dropped to a 3.56, because I wasn't taking many credits, and got a B in another course (which I am grateful for, because most of my class failed, I will gladly take the B!)



I started crying earlier, because it feels like my one bad experience in a class will screw me over. I am going to have to attend this same community college due to costs, and my GPA there is now a 3.0, meaning I may not have access to the honors or research courses that I was planning for fall, and have seriously blown my shot at many of the univerisites I was interested in. They do not allow grade forgiveness unless the course was taken over 5 years ago, and their policy is that I cannot take the course again because I have now taken it twice, they will include the W. I did pretty well in Calc 1, I had a B and was close to an A for most of the semester, struggled with related rates and that one bad grade brought me down. I have gotten perfect grades in Statistics and Computer Science as well up until this point.




My transfer goal for next year was GA Tech or USC. I know admission for CS majors is higher for women at some schools, but I don't really put faith in that. I feel like I can do well in Calc 3, but I'm not sure if that will make up for this blunder. I have a 32 on the ACT, 33 superscore, and a ton of extracurricular activities and awards.



I've done research in high school and college, won two science fairs, presented my college research in AI and ML to a huge tech company, my contributions were included in a paper that was submitted for publication, I've been on student council in HS and college, I won a high level state writing award, AP Scholar, been learning music for a year and had several concerts, a few hackathons (including at harvard) I founded a GSA in high school and was president, volunteered a ton in HS doing STEM community service like bioblitz, tutorting, lecturing on research, leadership position in Japanese speaker's club in college, worked since I was 16, currently work in technical support for my uni, and have an upcoming research internship at a national lab for CS.



I also have a very unconventional background because I grew up really poor and living on my grandparent's farm. I have been almost entirely self sufficient since 16, one of my parents died from drugs/alcohol when I was really small and the other is severely mentally ill. This is a perspective that I talk about a lot in my essays, and how it has motivated me to become a researcher, and never give up my pursuit of learning.



Even with my extracurriculars and circumstances, do you all think that a C is going to be the nail in the coffin for a Neuroscience program or double major program? Will this bar me from entering good graduate schools? I've been so upset about this, wishing that I could have prevented it even though I studed vigorously and grinded practice problems like no one's business.",college,"I was planning on transferring, and recieved a C in a course.

For years we pushed for simply high school degrees but because everybody had one, we pushed for bachelors. And now many jobs are pushing for masters. I’m a teaching major and I get more benefits and pay if I have one, and I can teach AP with it. And many secretaries nowadays need bachelors, even if all you do is bookkeep, answer a phone and check emails. However, we had a discussion over this and one thing I learned was because we push it so much, there might come a day where you need multiple PhDs just to get an entry level position. 

I realize that college isn’t for everybody, and that’s not because of my class. I know a lot of people who do better at trade school than college, but they still get penalized. The valedictorian my freshmen year was a first gen, bilingual Portuguese cheerleader, NHS, student council president who had good SAT scores and came from a poor family. She ended up going to beauty school because she was good with hair. However, a lot of people i knew called her an idiot because of that. But she was happy trying to become a hairdresser. My family saw her at our stylist’s salon a few times observing for her hours. 

I still push for it if you know you won’t like college, as you can have better job prospects, just sometimes it might be expensive to finance and you need to network a little more. I say that because I wanted to become a librarian, but thanks to the recession and because there’s too many people with that degree, you could spend six years making 30K or start off making 70K or have no job at all for the next ten years and then suddenly start making 20K. 

And I think most people associate trade school with stuff like plumbing or mechanics. But if you do further research, you can learn coding or sonography or wielding or a police officer or a slew of other things. Although I will admit it’s getting a little harder to be a cop as some places require a degree or they made the requirements harder. And you don’t have to go to school for four years with trade school, you just need to have experience.

So while finding a way to pay for the apartment, I would still have to pay 12k for my tuition. Of course I knew that at some point I would have to take out some student loans but I feel like 48k in student loans is too much.

One important thing to note is that I live abroad and my sister and my mom share a room in my grandma's house in the US and my sister currently goes to CC. My grandma also rents the other rooms and I definitely don't want to share a room with my mom, and my grandma doesn't really want to let me live in her house because she rents the other two rooms to women (I'm a guy).

I am an artist. A very good one. It’s not a brag, it’s just a statement. I have ALWAYS wanted to go to college for a masters degree in animation or illustration. I’ve always wanted to see my art take me somewhere.

It’s my dream to just be a creator. I want to make digital art professionally.

But here’s the thing. I live in the Midwest. There’s no careers here for me. So I wanted to go to college out of state. Somewhere with a reputation! And I got accepted into an incredible art school. My dream school.

But this college is insanely expensive. $45,000 a year expensive. Even with the scholarships I’ve got.
I’m beginning to dread my future. My parents want me to work two jobs, which I’ve already been doing. I work 8-9 hours every single day with my primary job and sometimes I do overtime as well. With my second job that’s on and off, that’s an extra 3-4 hours during a day. I work so so much. I’m exhausted! I’m working so hard. My youth has passed me by. My summers are always spent working, working, working. Last year I don’t think I got to go outside one bit.

I just am so afraid. I’m going to work myself to death for this stupid college and then I’ll work myself to death after college to pay off debt. I’ll never have time. I’ll never have my life.

I can say that my academics are top notch, and I have a comfortable amount of savings in my bank account from working even tho I don’t need to. But socially is where I fall behind. I’m an introvert and like to spend most of my time by myself and get mentally exhausted pretty quickly if I’m hanging out with friends. The thing is, I have a shitload of free time, even tho I work and such, but I choose to do activities, both at home or out and about by myself. 

Therefore I don’t have much friends to do something with on the rare times I would. I’m not in any relationships and have tried to rely on tinder/bumble so much for it (I deleted them on the 3rd). Sometimes that makes me kinda sad and wish I put more time and effort into meeting people. 

Last year when I started college I joined my college’s anime club. Made a lot of friends, had a great time that year and loved it. But the college itself was super expensive for out of state students, so I went back in state. Last semester I just went through it without putting in any effort of meeting people and just spent almost all time with myself and I’d go to my job that was 2 hours away (20 minutes from my house). I drove all that distance because it paid nice and I enjoy being there. I’m an assistant Teacher at a Montessori school with great kids and awesome coworkers, so I was lucky I made all my classes MWF so I could spend my Tuesdays and Thursdays there. 

This semester however, all my classes are T Th, so I cancelled the housing and I just commute about 1:45 each way twice a week since I have MWF free to work. So socially, I’m not doing myself any favors. I’m doing great with grades and money, but I wish I was more social. And also last year I went to an SEC school so Greek life was huge. Except I was always one of those who just talked shit about frats without at least rushing to see if I like it. I wish I did, but at this point for me it’s a bit too late. “But you’re a junior, you still have time!” 

I’m actually going to study abroad in Strasbourg, France for the academic year September-May, and when I come back I’ll only have one semester left. I’m really committed to French and wanting to experience French and other cultures abroad, so I hope to step out of my comfort zone and put the extra effort into meeting people. It would be to improve both my language skills, and social skills in general. I plan to travel a lot while abroad and I know I’ll be by myself most of the time when doing it, but I’ll at least try to go to a nightclub or do some other people-oriented things. 


So in short, i wish I had joined a frat, and I wish I’d put more effort into meeting people in general instead of being a hermit and spending all my time by myself. Don’t get me wrong, going to the movies, amusement parks, restaurants, etc alone is awesome. But then I miss out on things such as relationships and it sucks.

308,makeshiftmelissa,1554863008,/r/college/comments/bbgpx8/what_do_i_do_if_not_approved_for_private_student/,"Hello,

This is a repost from r/financialaid.

I am in dire need of advice. Some background: I am an extremely low-income, independent undergrad student. I am independent by dependency override due to abuse &amp; abandonment. This means I get 0 help financially from my parents--I support myself in all facets. I spent my first 2 years of college at a community college &amp; transferred this year, as a junior, to an ivy league institution across the coast.

I technically get a full-ride, but this doesn't include any living expenses outside of dorm housing. So, I don't actually see any of the money I'm getting. I am currently working as many hours as possible.

My predicament: because of moving expenses and living expenses (I live in a VERY expensive city), I have maxed out my credit card at this point. Secondly, some of my financial aid is reported as income on my taxes, so now I owe about $800 in taxes. I tried taking out a student loan to help with this for the Spring semester, but found that I was ineligible because my ""budget"" for the academic year was maxed out, meaning no more aid. I was told that I could get aid if I go on a summer program, as my school doesn't provide grants for summer, but they do provide loans.

So, I signed up for a summer program that was very expensive, but I was able to get the entirety of the program costs covered by scholarships. My plan was to take out a loan to cover the expenses previously mentioned, as well as pay for my plane ticket back to school after summer. I also have to pay for storage of my dorm stuff over summer. Also medical expenses from a recent hospitalization. 

I felt secure in my plan until today. When I went to the financial aid office to confirm my loans, they told me that they won't disburse any summer student loans until July. That's far too late: I won't be able to get by the summer with the costs previously mentioned. I would cancel my summer program, but it wouldn't even help me as I have no way to pay for the things previously mentioned and will likely be unemployed over the summer as I doubt I will be able to find short term employment where I live. Staying in the city where my school is is not an option as I will be homeless.

I applied for a private student loan and was approved, but when looking more into the ""certification"" process by my school I'm fairly certain it won't get certified because my cost of attendance is already maxed out by the aid they give me. Or, they won't disburse it until July. I don't know what to do and my financial aid office was incredibly unhelpful. I'm so scared, I really don't want to be homeless again, and I don't know how I'm going to get through the summer and get back to school for the Fall.

I'm sorry if this is super confusing (this entire situation/process is for me) and frantic. This has completely sent me into crisis mode and I don't know what to do. Do I have any options? The only thing I can think of doing if my student loan gets denied is taking out another credit card and accruing more debt that way, but I'm honestly not sure that I'll be approved...I've been applying for scholarships but that's not reliable enough funding (as I do not know that I'll get them). Should I take out a private non-student loan? Can I even do that? I really don't have anyone/anything to fall back on and transferring to this school has left me destitute.

Any help would be so appreciated.

309,ihatethatcong,1554673103,/r/college/comments/balgva/not_sure_college_is_right_for_me/,"As the title says, I'm not sure college is for me. I'm not stupid, and I love to learn. Yet I'm doing consistently badly in my classes. I'm majoring in music and engineering, and this is my second semester at as many universities. The first university was too expensive, though it was a prestigious school. Administration kept batting me around over there, and I figured it was a bad investment. I also wasn't feeling very good about the whole college things over there either.

This semester, I don't have as many friends, people in general aren't as interested in discussing ideas with people, which is understandable. I've been able to use the library and I've been able to learn a lot about the stuff that interests me, but I haven't really learned much in my classes. I'm actually doing worse here (grade-wise) than I was at the more prestigious school because, even though the material was equally uninteresting and more difficult, it was easier to focus. Here, everything moves so slowly I can't focus at all, and end up needing to teach myself everything.

It's not challenging and it's just really really boring and dull. I could change majors, but I think I'll end up with the same trouble even if I'm more interested in the subject. I've gotten better at the school-aspect of things and spend several hours at the library every week getting work done and learning material, but I just hate it. I love learning things, but I hate people telling me what I have to learn and when I have to learn it and what I have to do to prove I've learned it and all that.

I don't think I'm ready for college. It just makes me frustrated and I'm not interested in anything I'm doing. The engineering courses are only passingly interesting, and I've already learned the content in all of my music classes (these are the only classes I'm doing very well in, which is surprising to me, I generally do terribly in easy A classes). My private music instructor is very knowledgeable in bad information, so I've begun lessons outside of my university. It was the same way at my other school.

Maybe I need to switch majors, but I don't know what I'd major in. There are a lot of things I enjoy, in fact the librarians have incorrectly guessed my major based on what I check out a bunch of times. I'm interested in history and philosophy, and all that, but I don't trust my school to do a good job with those topics. The students and professors from those departments that I've met seem to be kind of full of hot air (at both schools it seemed to me that it was this way). I don't trust the humanities departments to get their students to really think, the ones I've met mostly just parrot stuff they've learned and think they're smart. A handful actually think critically. I don't want to spend my time learning about and discussing ideas and stuff like that if that's how discussions are going to be.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I really don't like college that much. I'm in multiple organizations, so it's not as if I'm not involved. I've made friends, so it's not like I'm some poor lonely bastard who wants to quit because I don't have any friends. I'm just incredibly bored and hate all my classes. I don't think college is for me and I want to do something else.

(Basically they're very mentally and emotionally abusive towards me combined with strictness. I want to improve my mental health/and myself without having them around to break me down even more) I have 4 options

College 1 

Pros: A private school, with great and updated equipment. Suites for first and second years students, Everyone seems friendly, Small class size (I think undergrad population is around 4,000-5,000) It's in an area I am familiar with and I like it overall. I can also see my sister from time to time without driving long hours. Also is a dream school for 9th and 12th grade.
Cons: Expensive. (After aid without scholarships I'll owe about 25k) (that includes living on campus and other expenses) 

College 2

Pros: Not as expensive, close friend have committed, Requires to live on campus for the first 2 years. 

Cons: Haven't visit the campus due to parents saying it's too far. (It's on the other side of the state) 

College 3

Pros: Decent area, another friend committed there. (I don't know her as long as my best friend)  Alot of great things I heard about the school. 

Cons: Huge school (2nd largest in the state with 20k+ undergrads) A major party school (I'm trying to take baby steps since I've been sheltered since birth) 

College 4

Pros: Dream school for 10th+11th grade, Beautiful large campus, Best business program in the state (from what I heard) very diverse.

Cons: Recent race issues and strangers breaking into dorms, also dorms having mold/not up to date. Parents complaining about it being far. (It's only an hour and a half away) I heard it was a party school too. Largest school in my state. (Around 30-40k+)

Being from a big city, I did not do well on a campus with only 2,000 students. At this school, I was more depressed that I've ever felt.

I'm currently attending Stevens Inst. Of Tech in Jersey. I went in as a civil engineer (rather arbitrarily as anyone who chooses their major would), and a semester and a half later realize that I don't enjoy coding, which is emphasized in the core ""engineering"" department. Stevens is known for its good engineering program, and for getting you a nice fat paycheck out the gate.

But I feel I don't want that anymore. I enjoy the core mathematical/physical sciences aspect of my curriculum right now but I know it'll only divulge into rigorous coding or hands on experience that I can't even tell I might like until my 5th semester (engineers concentrate in year 3).

This leads to the big problem: Stevens is way too expensive, making it lack in any sense of value anymore to me. It's also limiting for a potential major switch (if I wanted to switch to a math major at Stevens, it would probably just be engineering continued).

So I guess the point I'm trying to get at is that I want to transfer somewhere cheaper, still have something to do with STEM, but not exclusively engineering. The idea floats around in my head of teaching (which is arbitrary, but less so than ""civil engineer"" because I can actually picture myself as a teacher).

Should I:
1.just maintain the course at Stevens
2. Look for more options to apply to for the fall 
3. wait until spring because it's too late to apply for fall
4. Take a gap year

I have helicopter parents that have always caused a lot of stress in my life and I think I’m done with them holding me back, and helicoptering me, and berating me, among other things. When people talk about how close they are to their parents, I can’t really relate bc for some reason or another I never really developed a close, communicative and relaxed relationship with them. I think the worst thing that I would have to deal with is food options and financial help, since my parents make too much money for me to get any financial aid.

It’s alright with my mom, but even though she necessarily isn’t abusive or anything, I think her helicoptering is really holding me back from developing as a person. Going out for at night or staying late at school is enough for her to have to call multiple times, wanting the details of every little thing, and just being paranoid and anxious about everything. The worst thing is that when I was younger, she would accuse me of always doing something or planning to do something bad, and making feel guilty for things I didn’t even do. She still does it now, but now I just shut her out and don’t care what she has to say and so I can’t take anything she says seriously which is kind of sad I guess. Im always just ridiculed and laughed at by both my parents so im just done with them not taking me serious. To them I’m probably still in middle school.

 As for my dad, honestly he just pays my tuition, and that’s it. I think a lot of my mental problems are related to how he would treat me, (being just overall physically and mental abusive) and I think he’s bipolar or something. One day he’ll be so soft, and the next (or a few moments later) he’ll be cursing me out screaming at the top of his lungs the nastiest things he can think of. The sad part is that he truly means those things and he’s genuinely wants me to feel bad and low about myself but I’m done with that. I rarely  talk to him in general, and literally I think the most I say to him on a particular day is an ok or alright to whatever he’s yelling or telling me to do. 

I think I’ll be so much happier living on my own, but it would just be a financial problem. I go to school in Southern California (expensive) and I don’t know antibody who would want to be roommates or anything like that. I don’t even have a job but I’ve been trying to get one.

Money is not an issue for me and my family, and I am very lucky for that to be the case. However, I'm having a hard time deciding what to do here. I spent two years after high school at CMU, double majoring in Chemical and Biomedical engineering. I took a gap year after the two because of a variety of reasons, but I ended up being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I wasn't able to apply to UC's or anything due to a hospitalization last year during my gap year, so it's entirely between these two schools.

Despite understanding that everyone is different and that different people will fit in different schools, what do you guys think I should do? Transfer or stay?

For me, I personally wanted to go back to CMU. I had a severe problem with my attitude and undiagnosed mental health problems. Those problems are not solved, and with the bipolar disorder, will most likely never be solved, but I would like to think that now that I have recognized these problems, I can tackle the challenges I have left at CMU with a different, more productive mindset. I also made sure there are health institutions set up in Pittsburgh so that I will continue treatment.

However, there are a lot of very good reasons for me to go to SJSU. It's closer to home, near health institutions I've been using throughout this year off. The programs at SJSU are good, and its considerately  cheaper (although I am lucky enough to not have to worry about cost).

I'm just frustrated. People want me to go to SJSU, but i spent two years at CMU and I did well. My GPA is about 3.4, I have research planned with a professor there, and I was on track to finishing a double engineering major. I feel like I've earned my right to go to that school. 

Before anyone asks, yes. Prestige is a part of this choice. CMU is undoubtably a ""sexy"", ""prestigious"", fuckin ""bourgeois"" institution. And I know; none of that matters, because a person going to SJSU can be a better coder or engineer or student or ANYTHING compared to someone at Harvard or MIT, let alone CMU. But then why doesnt EVERYONE that graduates high school in a 20 mile radius of go to SJSU? Is every student at an expensive private school a fucking sucker? Too caught up in their own fucking pride? Am I a fucking brainwashed fucking sheep for wanting to go to a school that is known and respected? Not that SJSU isnt known or respected! But then once again, why doesnt everyone go to SJSU?? 

I'm just frustrated. I made poor choices all my life based on shitty fucking reasons. Doing things for other people and what they want, never doing things for myself. Now I'm supposed to make a decision for myself and I just, my gut tells me I dont want to SJSU and I want to go to CMU. But I dont trust my gut.

On the other hand, I got into UIUC and Purdue both for engineering, which they're globally recognized and highly ranked (top 10).

I'm trying to go back to school this fall and I've applied to three places, and I've gotten acxepted to all three. William Paterson University, Kean University, and Fairleigh Dickinson University (Florham Campus).

That's all well and good, but the financial aspect really stresses me out. I was pretty much brought up in poverty. We're still poor. Even when I was working, things were pretty hard. Tuition prices, frankly, scare the shit out of me. Add on the fact that I'm an out of state student, and it's even worse. On the bright side, I'll likely be an in-state student after a year or maybe two tops.

I know Fairleigh Dickinson is a private university, and unsurprisingly more expensive as a result, but if I go there I'll be receiving the University Dean's Scholarship ($17,000 anually) and I'll likely have an established support network there (I have a friend there and a couple nearby) vs the other two schools where I'll be receiving no scholarships and my support system isnt right where I'll be, but it's significantly cheaper if we aren't factoring in the scholarship from Fairleigh Dickinson. If we count the scholarship, I think they're all close to the same? Fairleigh might still be a bit more expensive. Kean and William Paterson are both public I believe too, and Kean is the cheaper of the two I think.

I know I'm going to be in debt no matter which school I choose, but Im not so sure what to prioritize here. Obviously a quality education is most important, but I'm not even sure which school is ideal for that. Aside from that, finances worry me a lot. But should I focus on trying to save money? Should I focus on having a pre-established support system in a new place? Should I focus on opportunities that may present themselves around each campus?

319,FreezingDemon,1551458648,/r/college/comments/aw6z2p/help_me_decide_between_three_majors_please/,"Hello everyone! I'm currently a freshman student in my spring semester. After essentially wasting this school year trying unsuccessfully to make engineering work out for me, I've decided to not continue with engineering anymore. March 12th is when I can schedule summer classes (which I will need to take to catch up regardless of major) so I've constantly been in a mind-battle trying to decide on my path for the fall! 

**Computer Science**

Pros: 

* Easiest major to schedule (so this isn't a significant pro, but still a pro regardless)
* Marketable, in demand, lots of opportunities after graduation
* Opportunities for where I am interested in working (My end goal would be to work in space/aerospace)
* A 'sciencey' field 

Cons:

* Similar environment/people as engineering? (One of the many reasons that engineering didn't feel right to me was the overall feeling I got when I was in class. I'm a social butterfly, and most people...were not. While people don't have a real bearing on my education, the environment just felt off for me personally.)
* I don't feel the 'spark' (I've tried to learn Python using things like CodeCademy and MIT OCW and all that. It just feels...okay. )
* Don't know if I would actually do well/ enjoy it (Goes back to previous con. I've never taken a programming course before, and I know that you don't have to, but I just don't know if it would be right for me.)

**English + Medical School**

This one is probably crazy-sounding and impossible since I totally just thought about this a couple days ago but hear me out for a sec. Some of my greatest strengths are in writing, reading, and speaking. I know that I would have a strong chance of enjoying and succeeding as an English major. But then I thought about medical school. It would allow me to still pursue my interest of using science to better humanity and help others, on top of creating a balance between humanities and science in undergrad.

Pros:

* Have a strong chance of doing well/enjoying English major
* Science classes + humanities would be fulfilling to me because I'm a jack of all trades and like to be well-rounded
* Possibly better environment for me?
* Would have a goal I would be fighting for all throughout college 

Cons:

* Medical school is EXTREEEEEMELY hard to get into. Expensive, too!
* I don't know if medicine is right for me yet. Could I see myself doing it? Potentially. But I don't have a ton of experience in exploring the field like other pre-med students seem to have. The only thing I can think of is the time in high school when they had a day event for interested students and we visited a hospital.
* English isn't a good back-up major if I don't get into med school. I could reapply to med school or do a grad program or something, but still.
* Would most likely have to take another year to complete undergrad. It's not really a major con for me other than potentially the finances. (to be honest, I would secretly enjoy an extra year for extracurriculars since I wasted this year being miserable)

**Geology**

Pros:

* A good major for my interest in space. I would definitely be going to grad school and getting my Ph.D, in planetary science or another space-related field.
* I enjoy learning about Earth's history and how studying it can be useful in understanding the solar system. \[Also, rocks are cool. They always end up getting stuck in my shoe...maybe it's a sign? ;) (Just joking)\]
* My school offers a lot of geo classes. I'd most likely be doing the geophysics track.
* The most 'sciencey' of the three majors.

Cons:

* Again...don't know if I would do well/enjoy it. I've never taken a geo class before. The last time it was part of a class was in 8th grade. I really enjoyed it back then though!
* I would probably have to take Calc 3...ehh. I've taken Calculus 1 already, and if I do Geology/Computer Science, I'll be taking Calc 2 this summer. Math isn't my strong suit but I will work as hard as it takes.
* Not a very marketable degree by itself...or really even after grad school.

I’m pretty happy about that. The school was one of my top choices: relatively prestigious, well-resourced, good for the subjects I want to study, etc.

However, my parents are high income earners and therefore we’ll be paying a lot to attend this school. It’s a private school in the Northeast, so even with financial aid, my degree cost my parents roughly 150k over four years (so from 35-40k a year). Not bad considering the 70k a year price tag but still expensive enough that my parents have to draw into their savings and take out loans and stuff. 

I feel really bad about them doing this, especially since I had a chance of getting a good  merit scholarship elsewhere. I’m not sure if a college degree is worth that much no matter where it’s from. 

This ended up being a bit too long lol. I guess what I’m asking is, is this “investment” worth it? ",college,I feel guilty that my parents are paying so much for college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/asgq1v/i_feel_guilty_that_my_parents_are_paying_so_much/,1550635549.0
321,mrs_soup,1550110649,/r/college/comments/aqepab/should_i_give_up_hobbies_to_maintain_and_build/,"For a little background, I am a non-traditional student who only recently has been able to go to school. I didn't have access to regular school as a kid, and a lot of things I know now are self-taught through years of reading and personal research. I basically worked my way up from a 7th-8th grade education to getting my GED, and finally to college at 25.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am taking between 14-16 units per semester because I'm ""behind"" academically, and need a pretty rigorous schedule to transfer to an undergrad program since I have literally zero transfer credits. My first semester was relatively challenging under certain aspects, but not unmanageable and I made it through with a high GPA. Through this I kept up with a part time job and a hobby of Brazilian jiujitsu, weekly volunteer work, and making time to socialize.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this semester is proving a lot more tough. I have added in more science courses in addition to math courses (which I am the farthest behind on) that have started to ramp up now that I am 5-6 weeks in, and it's becoming really difficult to balance everything, mostly with BJJ. I mostly feel guilty if I take time to train that could have been spent studying or practicing different concepts I am struggling with. On the other hand, having participated in the sport for a number of years I also feel guilty if I am not dedicating time to train each week. I also suffer from depression which tends to manifest itself in a greater way when I try to do too many things at once or put a lot on my plate. One training session can easily take 3.5 hours out of my day from getting there, to training, driving home, showering, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to post this on r/BJJ because I know that I will get lots of replies along the lines of, ""Suck it up, no excuses"", so I figured I would ask here since I'm sure there are other people who had to sacrifice doing something they love for a better future. I guess it is also worth noting that I am paying for school out of pocket, and my jiujitsu school costs me approximately $2000 annually just for gym costs. I also live in California which is quite expensive.

One person said they were 90k in debt when graduating and I find that completely absurd. I will take the unpopular opinion and say that is her fault and not the fault of the education system. Before going to college, she knew where she would be when she graduated, broke and 90k to pay back. Since she owes so much, I would assume that she is going to some prestigious private school. A school she didn’t get a full ride or likely a scholarship to, but went there because it was her dream school. So I guess what I am saying is that she should have gone somewhere cheaper, and she should not be blaming the education system when from the beginning she knew it would cost an arm and a leg. 


I guess I’m just sick of people complaining about the price of college and how they are 90k in debt. It was their choice to go somewhere expensive and likely without a scholarship. Although college probably is too expensive, I think people should choose somewhere they can reasonably afford and not complain about being 90k in debt because they just HAD to go to their dream school.

I’m already graduating high school a year early because I tested out of a few classes.  

I’ve never been able to relate to students my age and for the longest time I viewed university as a gateway to more mature peers, like some sort of mystical switch that would make my social life flourish and suddenly turn everyone into a deep thinker. As graduation approaches, I’m realizing that is *not* the case. But I do expect at least somewhat of a social life since I’ll be attending a pretty large campus. I also want to take a lot of specific electives in addition to classes required for my major, and I’d like time to fully explore. Lastly, I’m really looking forward to taking classes and travelling with this honors program through my university.   I’m worried that if I graduate early, I’ll miss something, rush into the real world too quickly, and end up regretting it forever. However, it will save money and being at least 2 years younger should give me somewhat of an edge in gaining career experience, I think. 

Is college any better socially than high school? Should I graduate early since I have the credits to do so? 

Tl;dr: 
Pros: Potentially better social life, honors program, travelling abroad, more elective courses

Cons: Way more expensive, not focused on real world, possibly wasting time that could be spent  earning money and paying off loans early, not taking advantage of all of the work I put in to get a ton of college credits in high school

I'm a very, very indecisive person, and the first of my entire family to pursue a 4 year degree or attend a full-time college. I would immensely appreciate input from more experienced people, or perhaps alumni from either school. Thank you.

1. Arizona State University - Honors College at Tempe

I've been to Arizona several times, as my parents are looking to move there after I graduate high school. (Not sure how realistic that is though, they've been saying they're gonna move there for years.) I'm accepted into Barrett, The Honors College, which I hear is pretty great. There are a lot of scholarship and travel opportunities, shorter class sizes, first choice when it comes to  signing up for classes, amazing dorm rooms with private bedrooms, etc. I get in-state tuition as long as I keep my gpa above a 3.0 due to an automatic scholarship, but it sounds a bit risky and concerns me since I've never had any college experience aside from APs and Dual Credits. I do like Arizona, it's beautiful there, but I'm not really sure what the Phoenix culture is like or if I'll fit in. I do like it a lot out west and it seems to have a lot of opportunity. I hate the heat, but I keep getting assured that it's only hot in the Summer and Fall. This is the college my family wants me to 100% go to, btw. The pressure to attend here kinda makes me not want to? This option is more expensive, costing an estimated 31,792$ per year (without federal aid.) As a last concern, I am worried about the school's reputation--I know ASU is kinda looked down upon as a party school without much substance to it. I'm not sure if being in Barrett remedies that.


2. University of Minnesota-Twin Cities

This is the school I'm more familiar/comfortable with, I guess, since I live in Wisconsin. I'd be close to my family (besides my parents if they move). I've visited once--it's a really awesome campus, and I feel an overall friendly/positive energy from it. I get in-state tuition due to a repriocity deal. I know the school has a pretty great reputation, too. I'm not super fond of how frigid it is, but I've dealt with it my whole life and I'm not worried about dealing with it some more. I feel like the overall aesthetic suits me more, but also that just might be because it's more familiar and homey to me. I love the culture of the Twin Cities though, a lot. And I enjoy how much opportunity there is to learn. I feel like I'd be able to better explore possible majors here, since Barrett is primarily CLA majors. A few of my HS friends are going there, but I know I shouldn't decide based on that. Also, the dorms are nice but small and the class sizes are huge but I'm willing to push through it. This is the cheaper option, at ~27,528$ per year not including federal aid or scholarships.

Something about paying thousands of dollars for a degree that will (maybe) one day allow me to pay off those thousands of dollars doesn’t sit right with me anymore. Books are expensive and the professor rarely uses them. So far the books I’ve been required to by are those one with the online packet that renders the book unsellable when the seal is opened. 

My dream job is working with kids, and that pays absolutely shit. Teachers deserve so much more than they’re getting. We’d have better teachers if everyone got paid what they deserve. Teaching seems like a minimum wage job now. 

I worked with kids while I was a student and it was the best job I’ve ever had. I was so happy but I was broke as hell because it required me to be a student to work there. And I’d just had enough if school. Paying to do homework and write long ass essays? I saw the point a couple years back, but I’m halfway to my degree and just can’t feel it anymore. 

Maybe I’m not a hard enough worker. School was never really a struggle for me but college feels Ike pulling teeth more and more. The more I do it, the less I see the point. I want to do something I love, but I don’t want to be poor. The one thing teachers will tell you about teaching is that you better do it for the love because you’re not getting money. And I’ve been poor before and don’t ever want to go back to that. 

I wish in American High Schools (at least the one I went to) teacher’s didn’t so much stress the importance of college. I mean, sure it’s great for a lot of people! They learn a lot and have an amazing time and end up with a cool job during and afterwards. And then some of us struggle. Not because the curriculum is too hard, but just because it SUCKS.  But growing up we got told one thing: Go to college or be poor. 

No one tells you about learning a trade or getting a license for a job that starts out paying $50,000. It’s always go to college no matter what. 

Well I’m going to explore my other options. It can’t be any worse than what I’m doing right now, which is being a broke college student. If in the end it doesn’t work, I’ll go back and finish the last half of my degree. Until then, I will not attend college.

- It’s okay to not know what major you want to be

Don’t decide on a major if you’re iffy about it. Give yourself time to think, you have probably a year’s worth of prereqs to blow through before you likely need to decide for sure. High school places a lot of emphasis on knowing what you want to do but the truth is: there’s a sizable amount of people who go into college not knowing, even people who have declared a major may not know. If you’re hesitant to get started on something, switch your major to undeclared until you’re ready.

- Switch majors if you’re unhappy 

Don’t keep paying for something you don’t want to do. Even if it sets you back, that’s better than being stuck with a degree you don’t want to pursue and regretting it later on. The conversation may be hard to have with your parents or your partner or whomever but in the end you’re there to find your success and your happiness, not to wind up somewhere you don’t want to be.

- Take advantage of student services 

Your tuition is covering a lot of services you may not know about but are free to you to use. Many campus have an on staff therapist or two if you need to sit down and talk with someone. Even more campuses have a health center that will provide you with basic medical supplies and medicine; some even give free STD screenings and shots. It’s likely every single college has a gym of some sort where you can go to run, lift, or use the courts to play basketball or other games. There’s a lot you campus has to offer, use it while you can before you’re out of there and are have to pay for it out of pocket.

- C’s get degrees but don’t expect a reference

If you’re aiming to just get your Bachelor’s or Associate’s degree then getting C’s are fine. You’re overall GPA does matter depending on what field you’re going into, and especially if you plan on continuing to graduate school, but in the end getting straight Cs is not as detrimental as it was in high school. THAT SAID, don’t expect a reference from any of your professors if you’re putting in the bare minimal effort just to pass.

- Don’t EVER buy a textbook until the first day of class unless told to do so ahead of time   

Plain and simple, text books are a fucking scam. They’re overpriced when brand new and some classes force online portions just to ensure you can’t get it rented or used. Don’t spend the money unless you have 100% confirmation you have to, and even then if you don’t need a brand new text, use Chegg.com to save you loads. Even then, some classes will claim to need a textbook but wind up never using it so ask around to see if you truly do actually “need” it. 

- Hang out anywhere else but your dorm room

I know it can be intimidating when you’re in a new place but it’s not healthy to be hold up in your room during all of your free time. Most dorms have a lobby of some sort, so if you want to read a book or play a game on your handheld, go do it in the lobby; it’ll get you out of your room and maybe even meeting new people. People who stay shut in their dorms tend to be more lonely and even depressed. 

- Make sure you know each of your professor’s attendance policy 

Each professor is different with varying levels of how strict they can be. If you can only miss three days, you better be sure you count how many you have left before they start docking you points. If they are incredibly lax about it, don’t abuse it because you’re only going to hurt yourself 

- Just get up to use the bathroom if you need

Don’t make a big deal about it. Don’t try to draw attention to yourself. Just get up and leave and no one will care. Professors cannot forbid you from leaving under any circumstance and if they try to then you can challenge that with the dean. You’re an adult, you do what you need to do. 

- Be nice to your professors

This should go without saying but remember they at people too and deserve your respect. Not only are they taking time from their life to help you further your education but they are also a valuable resource. Many professors have some sort of credibility and can be a great reference down the line if you’ve put in the work and haven’t tainted your name. 

- Don’t join a frat or sorority until your second semester at the earliest 

College takes time to get used to. It’s a different lifestyle with a different type of workload and you will need time to adjust. As fun as frats and sororities may seem, they’re also going to ask to take a good chunk of your free time that you may need. At that, depending on what sort they are, if you’re going to get into the party lifestyle with these organizations, at least know you can handle your work and school life first. I’ve seen so many students join a frat or sorority their first semester only to get completely burnt out because they weren’t able to handle balancing both of these completely new lives. 

- Don’t abuse your newfound freedom

For many freshman this is your first time away from home, and while freedom is nice you do need to realize that it can easily be taken away as well. Yes, you’re going to want to party and stay up incredibly late and try a ton of new things you never got to do but realize that you’re paying a lot of money to get an education first and all these other things second. If you don’t take care of yourself or your educational duties first, you can easily find yourself right back at home with your parents should you screw up too bad. Realize that this is a privilege you have, and while you are an adult and you’re now making your own decisions, you still have to abide by the rules of the school. Be responsible.

- There’s so much free stuff! Take it!

Health services provides condoms. IT usually provides Ethernet cables for the dorm. Various offices likely have free pens and notebooks if you need them. 

- Assigned seats aren’t a thing but they sort of are

After the first week everyone tends to settle into a pattern. If the class is small enough there’s no harm in switching seats but just keep in mind if it’s already taken. Its not a major issue but most people resort to sitting in the same spot just out of habit. 

- Take a semester off if you need to, or withdraw if college isn’t for you

College is fucking expensive and your personal health and well-being comes first. If you need a break, the campus isn’t going anywhere and you can always come back. College is not for everyone, and though I will always promote furthering your education and bettering yourself in that regard. The truth is that the college environment isn’t for everyone and depending on what you want to do, you may not even need it. Don’t put yourself in debt for an experience you’re unsure of or don’t need. So many people are pushed into college before knowing what they want to do, don’t rack up the debt if you’re unsure of what path you want to take. It’s better to wait and be sure on where you want to go rather than get halfway through and realize you’re not following your passion; you’ll be wasting your time and be in debt you could have avoided. It’s okay to not know. It’s okay to take your time. It’s okay if college isn’t the route you want to take. 

- Don’t take a semester of all online classes ever if you live in dorms and/or don’t work

I’ve had a few friends think this is a good idea and found themselves bored out of their minds. Online classes tend to be self paced and you can get most of it done a lot quicker than you would otherwise. While free time sounds great, if you don’t have anything to fill that time then the semester is going to drag on. If you think you’re going to spend that time with friends, remember they all have classes too and are going to likely be busy when you’re free. 

- Sleep is important

For the love of god get some sleep. I only just learned how to have an actual okay sleep schedule and I’m finding myself being so much more productive than I ever was. There will be nights where you’re up until 3am writing papers or doing research but for the days you’re not, please get some sleep. Take melatonin if you need, it’s a life saver. You will be amazed at how much better your life will be when you’re not heading to bed at 3am and needing to be up at 7 or 8am. 

- You don’t need a ton of supplies

Every freshman makes the mistake of overbuying supplies and in reality you’ll only need a few notebooks, some pens and pencils, and whatever specific material is needed for a class. Save your money, don’t go overboard. Buy supplies as you need them, don’t preemptively purchase a ton of things you’ll never use.

All throughout public school I didn't apply myself socially or figure out myself, my grades were fine though. 5 years ago, when my family moved, I especially gave up on life in my mind, so school was more of a fever dream than an experience. I moved another time after that. I went through school incompetent, not even putting much critical thought to the class choice. I stayed longer than I had to, even though I could have gotten senior leave. And after that I stayed for two years inside of my room and my father's house, not even because I hate school or wanted to play guitar or video games, again I have no interests. I just kind of mindfucked myself, and did absolutely trivial shit, asked my mother to take me places for nonsensical reasons..No one knew anything about me. When I say I never applied myself socially, I really mean that. When I was 9 I began to fuck with myself and isolated myself. So it's been all of my life I've been feeling slightly dead, even though my body has been moved here and there, I've never really existed. 
So, I have a question. I know people who earn their future, have happier lives. 5 years ago, I lost my footing, because I only had one parent, and the familiarity was gone. And then I lost it again. What were my peers doing, what ARE my peers doing right now? I know they've looked at colleges, and come to the right one, but this decision has befallen me, and I'm not sure if I can do something else.. 
My father is trying to pay my way through this cheap college. He has other children too. How strange that I have done nothing, no accomplishment, he wants to this for me, and me still thinking this is not right. I should be paying attention to myself and what I want. So before I most likely go to this college: 
1. Can I pay for my college? 
2. Do I have the option to choose something I feel may be more beneficial, even if it is out of state, and more expensive ? I'm looking at colleges now, and for others, it is absurd for me to be able to pick and choose, but considering the lack of self investment, I would want to do something to make myself a little happy now.

329,throw_away_idklmao,1547296878,/r/college/comments/af71qn/i_fucked_up_my_university_choice_now_what/,"Hello /r/college. I'm a 19 y/o CS freshman from Italy. I am just in my first semester, but I am starting to feel like I fucked up my university choice.

I come from a classical high school that I got a diploma from with good grades consistently, which would be a great starting school, for something that is not related to maths. I absolutely suck at math, which means that it took me a lot of work to prepare myself for the admission tests, to the point I only passed them with a low score during the last selection.

I had three universities I was not admitted to: my city's university (discarded because it has CE but not CS), two universities that are quite close and I can commute to - one large and prestigious, one smaller - and a prestigious university that was quite far. Distance from home is not a significant factor of choice for me, but since I was only able to pass the last selection, the results came very late and by that time finding a place to stay in another city on a whim can be really painful and expensive. I decided to explore my options, but I ended up discarding that large university far away because housing was just too expensive (I regret this. Don't do it. Go where you want even if it costs more). Lastly I had the two ""'close"" universities to choose between. I would have gone to the big one on a whim, but I have a serious visual disability and the professions that follow me recommended me not to go there because they just don't care about students with disabilities and so I decided against it. The smaller university was still good - not a top school, but still good - and they were smaller and more prepared for disabilities. I went there. And I was disillusioned: so far, apart from a single professor, the attention to disabilities is very much inexistent. I've even had a professor told me to just deal with it because they can't write bigger on the blackboard, or provide me a way to purchase an accessible version of the textbook he wrote (which would be illegal… in high school). The campus is small and it's far from being well organized.

I am also generally not too happy here. It's a commuter's school, so you don't get the college experience. Lessons are in the afternoon for my course and I generally hate the experience. I commute for a total of 4 hours a day (which doesn't sound like a lot but trust me they add up) and I no longer have time to do anything else. It is not the university experience I wanted to have. On the plus side, the students are amazing. They're all very welcoming and helpful, and I had a group of friends immediately there, which I just didn't expect.

Still I am not happy. I think about it every day, I keep thinking what it could have been if only I had not fucked up the college admission process so brutally.

I'm planning to stick it out for one more semester anyway, but I have three options:

* Stay. Find housing here even though it's a commuter's school and get to know some students who also have apartments here. This will only apply if the disability thing has been sorted out, of course.
* Study for the test and apply to other universities again, do more fact-checking and research on how disabilities are handled everywhere, then when the results arrive drop out of here and matriculate to my new university on the same day (this closes my career so I start from scratch, like this year didn't happen)
* Attempt transferring. It's a mess because it's expensive, you have no guarantee what exams get recognized (might as well be none), the extra year in your current career does not look good, the boureocracy is slow, and you are in the second year (which is also harder to make friends), but you also have to follow the lessons for the freshman exams you didn't take and its overall unfortunate.

330,Agstevens,1547268553,/r/college/comments/af42on/should_i_transfer_or_not/,"Hi everyone. 
I’ll be starting my second semester of college on Monday, and I am kind of dreading it. 
 I’m a commuter student (18f) and my college is about 45 mins away. I am definitely going to finish up this semester, but I have never felt content with my decision to go to a private school over a cheaper online or state university. I got into an online school last summer, but chose not to enroll. I was so exited about the opportunity to go to a real college, but I have none of that motivation left. My tuition is about 30k a year. I’m lucky enough to have parents who will pay for most of my school costs, but I am feeling guilty about continuing this expensive education when my heart is not fully invested. Should I really be paying so much money when I could attend somewhere else for one-fourth the price? Thankfully I have 2 years of college credits already completed because I did an early college program online. My GPA is about a 3.4, but has been slowly declining as the courses get harder, even though I have been studying more than ever. I have not really began taking any electives yet, but by the time I complete my pre-requisites, I will be much further along. I have been taking more courses to finish up for a minimal cost as soon as I can. 


 I was homeschooled my entire life, and have never really had friends or did extra curriculars. I wanted to go to this school because it’s a small Christian college with some great staff (I have never liked the idea of forming or partying, and wanted a more conservative environment). The professors, advisors, and opportunities are all amazing, but I feel extremely disconnected with the students. I have not made any good friends or connections and the culture here is very “cliquey”. I thought that everything was right in the world when I got accepted, but now I kind of wish that I hadn’t. I will be doing a workshop this semester in addition to my other classes, and then I hope to get an internship or a job this summer...but I don’t feel like I would miss this place if I left. I keep hoping  for a more meaningful experience, but all of my attempts have been failing. Nothing that I do seems to be giving me any advantages or substance. I dread waking up on school days, and my mind is always elsewhere. If I don’t feel fulfilled at the end of my semester, I am going to bring up the question to my advisor and family about transferring. I thought about dropping out, but I have no plans after that and my family talked me into sticking it out. I have very little work experience, and I plan on majoring in technical writing. I loved online school so much, but I’m worried about becoming too isolated and comfortable being at home. Going to school is the only social opportunity that I really have, so I don’t feel ready to give it up completely...but I don’t want to have my parents or myself to be paying so much in tuition just for the possibility of making connections. If I do transfer, my only options are a large nearby state school where I would disappear into the crowd...or taking courses online and finding a job for some experience and income. I am worried that I will regret leaving this school, but also that I will stay for no good reason. I would love some advice. What would you do if you were in my situation?

331,Cialit,1546351258,/r/college/comments/abidj9/is_social_life_a_good_enough_reason_to_transfer/,"You heard it. I am a STEM major attending a big private research university. Transferring out, I probably won't make it into a school as good as the one I currently attend. 

I just can't get along with the social scene here; it is mainly run by frats. I have absolutely nothing against the frats -  they are mostly cool people -  but I have no time to join one and my campus treats you like a nobody if you're not in one. Greeks make up &gt;60% of the student body and most students who don't participate in Greek life - like myself - almost never go out. I *do* want to go out sometimes and still have a fun and vibrant social life, I just can't join a frat because they're goddamn expensive and time-consuming. I don't think being a STEM major should damn me to the life of a shut-in nerd, which I have been living as for the past 2 years. 

 I am not by nature a friendless or introverted guy, but damn am I friendless on this campus. It often really seems like you can't form friends here that are not your fraternity brothers.  

So the next best option is to transfer to a school with a fun social life that isn't completely run by frats (like Brown except I can't get into Brown). As a second semester sophomore, is this worth it or is it too late? Would you just suck it up, get the best grades you can, and cash in a shitty last 2 years of college for a brighter future later on? Or would you say fuck it and transfer?

332,zephyraaa,1545288366,/r/college/comments/a7vaj9/is_it_worth_still_going_to_college_when_i_have/,"Hello. I am writing this in tears right now, because I feel terribly lost and alone. I just don't know what to do. I feel like a loser and a disappointment.

*Long* story, I apologize:

I am a first year college student in community college, who has been dealing with depression for a good portion of my life now. I started in 2017, and was supposed to be in my second year now, but I withdrew from one class my first semester, then withdrew from two in my second semester. My mental health was already pretty bad by that time, in the spring of 2018. Now, it's winter and things have definitely have *not* gotten better. I am on financial aid probation. I stopped going to classes back in November, a week before Thanksgiving vacation. It's been a *month*. I just don't think I'll be able to do it.

Over the summer, my parents revealed some things to me, basically saying how they wasted money on my therapy back in high school, how they regretted ever doing that for me, and things got physical. I did *not* lay a hand on my parents, only to grab their arms to get them off of me because they tried to choke me. My father has a bad temper and heart problems, so I wasn't trying to exert him and send him to a hospital or anything. I said some stuff to them about not being there for me emotionally and how they drove my other sister away because of how they treated her (lives across the goddamn country). It's been months since the summer and I still don't talk to them. They're the kind of people that are traditional and set in their ways, really. They think depression and anxiety is something you can just get rid of the next day and that I wake up everyday *choosing* to be depressed, because why the fuck not, right?

My other sister, who lives here in-state still, tried to tell me, ""Oh, they say stuff when they're angry, but they don't mean it.""

Which is total bullshit. That shit came from the heart, they were sobbing and crying, sad for themselves really. Because of how expensive the therapy and medication was.

It just made me feel like a huge, huge burden. I feel really alone here. I have been to counseling at school, spoken to my adviser and such, etc., but it can only so far. I can't tell them everything, even though it is confidential, there are just some things you can't say to them.

Everyday I wake up, after only having maybe one - three hours of sleep -- some days I don't sleep at all -- and I walk to the train station to catch my bus. I feel like shit, I'm tired and sluggish, I slur my words, and I sway back and forth -- it's ridiculous. I can't sleep all night because I have too much anxiety, it makes my heart beat fast and I just can't get relaxed enough to go to sleep. Hours pass by, I check my phone for the time, and the minutes just go by as I lay there. The sun comes up, I give up on trying to sleep and just get dressed for school. Sometimes, I even get nightmares -- wake up abruptly in the middle of the night and I *can't* go back to sleep. I'm always too tired to function, I feel bad that I have a hard time focusing in class. I just can't do it, I even get nauseous sometimes. It's really affecting my performance.

I used to think about killing myself and just ending it, getting it over with and done, because I know I'm a burden and that I will probably just never get better. I just think that's reality, that I will always be depressed, in the end. I'm never going to truly be happy.

I already had these dark thoughts before starting college, but it's just become more frequent now. Pretty much everyday, I wake up thinking ""God, I should just hurry up and kill myself."" It's weird, though, because in the back of my head, I know that it's a crazy thing to think about, but at the same time I can't stop. I'm just so tired. I'm *really, really* fucking tired.

I don't have a real support system, only my older sister who lives in-state still. I don't want to tell my friends about my predicament. It's just embarrassing to me, and I don't want to sound like a drama queen. It was also how I was raised? I was raised to not tell anyone my personal business, and now I can't knock the habit. It's so ingrained in me, but I've been trying (reached out to my adviser who helped me make an appointment with a counselor, etc.).

I don't know anymore. I feel genuinely hopeless. I can't help but feel that I shouldn't have been born. I am truly not meant to be here. I don't know what my purpose is, other than to be a depressed, anxiety-ridden person -- the cautionary tale.

I just don't think going to college still is doing me any favors. It's added to my stress. Maybe I just started college too early? Maybe I should have waited until I got better. But I didn't have the money to see a therapist during the time I wasn't in school, so I didn't know how long that would take. I think I just applied for college because I thought the clock was ticking and I needed to do something, rather than waiting to get better so that things could go smoother for me in college life... which was the wrong thing to do, I guess. I was just working and isolated myself from everyone. I thought I'd make friends in college, which I did, but I still feel alone.

I feel like killing myself everyday. My heart hurts, my body is tired, my mind is tired and numb, and I just don't have it in me anymore. I'm so exhausted. I tried, I really, really wanted to do good in school. I have never done this badly in school before (had a hiccup there in high school, was still depressed then, but my teachers made a compromise with me to keep me going so I could graduate), and seeing my grades drop made me feel like absolute shit. I just don't think I have a place in this world. I wake up just feeling worthless.

334,AkakiAkakiyevich,1544919404,/r/college/comments/a6keuq/i_need_help_on_how_to_enroll_a_college_aboard/," Hello dear humans,

As you’ve seen in the title, I need help! I am writing this to get an advice for a situation that otherwise I am going to gone mad -probably not actually but, still it is.. ‘painful?’.

I am 18, from Turkey and graduated from high school on June, 2018. Since I decided to be a physicist -well, scientist would be a better term though,- (which was around the year I was 10th grader) I wanted to ‘fly out’ from Turkey, to study physics, and hoping eventually live there, or other place just out of here.. But financially it was -and is still impossible for me.

In around 11th grade I found out this scholarship given by Russian government, and joined interviews in 12th grade (around March, 2018). I started to learn Russian, and it was fun. I really do love Russian culture, literature, which was another reason I really wanted to go there. I am still learning Russian language today. Anyways, I was so sure that I would get that scholarship so that  I did not even search another way.. out. But that did not happened, and the interview was not what I expected either. It was a three minute interview that I could not expressed myself in anyway. I don’t know how to describe that interview, though not needed, it was kind of robotic, static, without hope, thoughts. Or maybe I was not quite enough to get that scholarship, I can’t tell, but clearly they did. After this, I still continue to learn on physics, and on all ‘sciences’ because I know that I don’t need university -tough free library would be great- to learn what humans understand or predict about the universe so far.

I was just ready to learn on electrodynamics, to finally see mathematical equations of those beautiful Faraday’s lines; I was just learning the linear algebra and multi variable calculus, essential grammars to understand those equations, then 12th grade was over. I should mention that this is nothing to do with that school, It was all by myself, internet, and those books that I bought from some international book stores, -and also there was some stores here that I could find books in English-. However, things had to change, with changing economic and sociological situation in here. It is now harder to buy books, especially from outside. It is now harder to focus, be comfortable, when people around me don’t have ability to think other way than the whole society thinks, though I don’t care this, it is just a fact for being uncomfortable. I really did not wanted to study in here, and I took SAT test, I did not like my test score (720 Math, 540 RW), so I did not apply any colleges, most of colleges in US also wants an English proficiency test (with this SAT RW, of course they would..) which I could not take, way too expensive for me.

Now I have to ‘study’ here…Tough, I still do not want to, I need to, otherwise I can’t run away clearly. I am preparing for those examinations here, just solving questions like a robot. Every time I look at those books on my desk ‘Introduction to Electrodynamics’, ‘ Mathematical methods for Physics..’, ‘University Physics’, ‘Journey to Quantum Gravity’ etc. I miss spend my whole ‘time’ at this -even at this- point of spacetime…  Of course it is just for a few months until after that exam, but it is a cry for help you see. In the end I will still be here, and now its getting harder everyday to breathe here. Since, I need more ‘time’ to bend the spacetime, I can’t be here for that long. I have not yet even learn those beautiful equations of Einstein’s, Schrodinger’s or others to build upon or maybe to destroy for new ones.

Tough, I am not very good with word all I wanted to do by writing this so long to express my situation, and my main goal in this life, consciousness, or I don’t know, I don’t think there is a term in human languages that express the thought on this life thing, or I don’t know any, or maybe that is because I don’t really know what it is. Anyway, I am open to any advice, is there anything that I could do? Like any other scholarships that I would apply. Or do I have to study here, to find a way out, maybe, hopefully.

335,wolverine237,1544727199,/r/college/comments/a5we87/advice_on_talking_to_my_niece_about_unrealistic/,"So, I am the only member of my family to go to college. As such, I have kind of taken on the job of helping my niece with college prep. She gets all As and A-s, and had good-not-great PSAT scores. Despite my suggestions, she has not taken any AP classes and doesn't do extracurriculers. Instead, she works nearly every hour she can under the table at restaurants. Her parents are not very involved in her life and she lives mostly with my parents, again under the table. Her legal custodial parent does not work and as such she is in a very good spot for need based aid.

As she has progressed through high school, she has developed what I perceive to be very unrealistic ideas about college. In spite of being close to a lock to attend the second-and-third best public colleges in our state for peanuts, she is insistent that she will only consider colleges in California. She is, imo, a bit naive about just how academically excellent she is (she goes to a very poor high school and her 1040 PSAT was top-5 in her grade) and as such constantly eschews any suggestions I make in favor of schools like UCLA and Stanford where she would almost certainly not get in. She's also extremely naive about how colleges work, she is under the impression that she will live in an off-campus apartment with her (already graduated, non-college boyfriend) and continue working 16 hour weekend shifts at restaurants. Part of this is cultural, she is not someone who has grown up with college as an expectation and she mainly seems to see it as a means to an end (to make more money) and not as a goal in it's own right... most people I know who have graduated from college were junior achievers who fantasized about living in dorms from a young age or the kind of people who kind of fell into a commuter school because it seemed like the thing to do, my niece seems betwixt and between.

Now, I went through my own California phase in high school and I have mostly been content to let this take care of itself. She'll apply to Michigan schools and California schools and let the financial aid offers each provides sort things out (her net price at Michigan State is ~$4k a year, at a low ranked Cal State school she's enamored with it would be $26k). However, as she preps for her SATs she is becoming even more convinced of the righteousness of the California fantasy and wants to apply exclusively to a number of Cal State schools and UCLA/Stanford only, and if they are too expensive move there and work while establishing residency. This strikes me as an awful and potentially ruinous path.

My parents believe that this is a non-issue and that telling her these ideas are not grounded will discourage her from even attending college. My brother, who is distant from all of us but talks to my niece, is encouraging the California stuff presumably because he doesn't understand the potential cost or the nuances of why the ""move to CA, establish residency, go to college"" plan is unlikely to work. He has neither the savings nor the creditworthiness to help her attend an out of state school (even a private college with generous aid would be a stretch), her mother is literally destitute.

What are some strategies that I might be able to use to steer her towards a more productive list of schools? I don't want to explicitly crush her dreams, I've researched all the schools in California and found one (the University of the Pacific) that provides anything close to a value for a student with her stats. But I also don't want to see her make some really massive mistakes that could set her back decades.",college,"Advice on talking to my niece about unrealistic college goals (HS junior, 1040 PSAT, 3.8 GPA, Michigan)",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a5we87/advice_on_talking_to_my_niece_about_unrealistic/,1544745199.0

I’ve had a hard time making friends since it’s such a small school (I made friends freshman year but we had a falling out and a lot of drama was spread) and everyone seems to be in a clique similar to high school or hiding away in their dorms. I live off campus this year, as last year I almost transferred but decided to stay and the one student housing building was full so I had to find an apt nearby. 

I’ve tried joining clubs and collectives, but I felt really uncomfortable in them and after deciding to stop going I’ve been given many dirty looks by the members and such, so it’s rare to feel comfortable with meeting new people here and it honestly feels like high school in a lot of ways. 

Academically, I’ve done fairly well (mostly A’s and B’s, only one C and one D last year; all A/B’s this semester) but I feel like I’m wasting money and time learning nothing about my major (Film) which is pretty technical and we’re not permitted to use anything besides DSLR cameras, until junior possibly senior year, unless we choose to buy our own equipment, which is highly expensive for even the most basic gear. (we’re not even allowed to check out green screens or light gels, which I’ve had prior experience with). 

Also, besides the school focusing more on the “art and design” majors rather than film, the success stories from alum seem far from many and the school seems to lack connections for film students. From what I’ve seen, most end up working for wedding video companies, freelance photography, or becoming cashiers for retail stores.

As I stated before, I almost transferred to a larger university last year but decided to give this school another chance since the first year can be filled with a lot of core stuff, but I still just often feel depressed and lonely here as well as dissatisfied. When I return home or visit other places I feel so much happier. I just feel like the school I’m at now isn’t going to prepare me for the real world and industry. 

I don’t know if I should try to just push through these last two years so I atleast have the degree, or if I should try again and transfer somewhere with better opportunities. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

341,benevolentbeeee,1539515393,/r/college/comments/9o1ykz/unsure_of_what_to_do/,"I'm currently a in college and I've been having bouts of depression and second thoughts while here. I had a horrible time my first month and had panic attacks and had very scary thoughts I'd rather not get into.

It's been a few months and I feel quite a bit better. I have friends, a sport, and my classes are easy so far.  However, I am unsure of what to do in regards for my future. The college I am currently in is in the middle of nowhere and I fear the lack of networking. It supposedly has a good department for what I want to do, but at the same time you have to ""prove"" you deserve your major and complete projects during your sophomore year that determine whether you get to be in that major or not and the one for my intended major showed me that is not the kind of work I want to make and it's way too abstract for me. There are also so many required things for freshman to go through. I had to go 3 weeks early for summer for a horrible pass/fail class every first year has to take. Then there is also another 2 week required course that cuts 2 weeks of our winter break. And another required class for all freshman. All of these things frustrate me a lot as I don't see a purpose for them. I  still get bouts of depression here due to homesickness and it gets especially bad when I have to leave my boyfriend from visiting.

I considered transferring to a bigger university with the program I want and possibly is taught in a way that I like better. I love the city its in, it'll be as expensive as the school I'm in now if I get no aid, but if I do, it'd be a bit cheaper. However, I do acknowledge I am especially drawn to this option because I'd get to live with my boyfriend. We both have talked this over and he loves me and would love to live with me, but also pushes me to truly see if I love the school and if it really is the best for me in the future. We both agree on that and even though we are in a very good place with our relationship, we never know what will happen and he says I need to truly love the school and feel that the program is best for my future that if something does happen between me and him, I still feel good at my school and don't come solely for him.

My last option is transferring to a school that only specializing in my major. At first, I did not want this because if I decided to change my major to lets say psych or STEM related I couldn't. Now I truly feel like I won't be happy doing anything else than what that specialized school offers. I feel like I'd still be sad to leave my boyfriend and family and friends, but if I was truly thriving and looking forward to my future and the work at school, it would be worth it. However, these schools are very pricy, even the ones near my home. It can be a bit risky I feel like since it's a competitive field. I just am not sure of what to do considering all these options and I know I ultimately have to make the decision myself, but it feels good to get it out and get some opinions.",college,Unsure of what to do,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9o1ykz/unsure_of_what_to_do/,1539533393.0

At the time it was the second half of my junior year. I had switched to the major midway through my sophomore year after starting in Business classes. I thought it was interesting enough, but I was starting to struggle with some personal problems which eventually led to me having to withdraw from the school. I wasn't forced to withdraw, as I had a 2.5 GPA by the time I left, but my GPA had dropped drastically from before junior year. I knew that if I was staying at that school, it only would've gotten worse. Moving back home has been tough but I've been working while taking a semester off to go back at a local school in the spring. The problem I'm having is that the nearest school that has a Geography program is much more expensive and a much further commute than my other options. Another school that's closer to me is a satellite school of a well-known university and fits with my budget, but their programs are limited and I'm worried about the reputation of the school. I'm not too sure about going back into business but their communications program looks good. Money isn't really a concern for me. I have grants that pay up to 20k a year for schooling. I'd really like to not have to take out a loan for a BA in geography, though. So I have a few questions with all of this in mind.

1.) What's the likelihood of my gen-eds transferring? Both schools I'm looking at are in a different state than my first school. It's gonna suck if I'm gonna have be living at home while in school until I'm 25. 

2.) What might be some other majors that I should know about? I've never really had a strong interest for any major I've taken so I honestly just want to get a degree in something broad and start looking for work. I can't change my major again though, as I've already done it twice and I'll most likely reach the time limit on my grant if I do.

3.) What can I do with a communications degree? I may still be interested in going back to business school but I originally dropped the major because of problems in my accounting and database management classes.

4.) Is a geography degree worth it in my case? I'm interested in it but I feel it limits my job prospects.

My first reason is that I hate the distance from home. My school is 1500 miles away from home, and so traveling back and forth during breaks is extremely exhausting (and not to mention expensive). I hate flying in general.

Number 2 is that I really don't like my college's location in the Midwest. It's nice for the first month or so, and then it becomes freezing cold and ugly and depressing. Plus, my city is not a very nice city.

Number 3, I know that after college, I want to live and work in my home state or one state over. Although my state school is ranked much lower than my current school, I feel like in my major (CS) a local school that more people know of would be better for getting internships/jobs in the location I want than my school right now. It makes travel to companies for interviews/internships much easier. They also might want to hire locally, which going to a state school would help with.

I also don't have too many friends here, but I am introverted in general so it's not a huge deal, as I will probably have the same social life here or there. At least near home, I can visit family whenever I want to, and I'd have a car so I can be a bit more mobile.

The thing is, I am not, like, depressed at my current school. I'm just unhappy and am wondering if transferring would be a good idea.

I went from being a first year student in an intensive four-year biochemistry program at an undergraduate christian university to taking two really easy classes at my local community college. I also had my first panic attack in college after deciding this. During my first year of college I made a lot of good friends, *failed pretty much every class I had,* learned way more about myself and how I think then ever before, changed my spiritual/philosophical views pretty hard, and gradually changed from the optimistic/relaxed person I had always been, into a depressed and anxious individual. 

Now I work 20-30 hours a week at a local Wendy's and am a part time student at my community college. I'm unsure of what I want to do, but I've changed my dream from biochemistry researcher to psychotherapist. I love science, love music, and enjoy helping people through their emotional problems. I think I've found the right thing for me at last, but after having a rather terrible start to this semester (skipping classes, not doing homework, several all nighters, etc.) I think that I just can't work with the academic world until I have my mental/personal issues worked out. 

Also even after finally taking my ADHD seriously for the first time in my life, my psychiatrist hasn't really done much to help me (ok the meds were nice I'll admit), nor do I think he will do anything more. He says he thinks I should seek a psychotherapist (weird how that works out) and I'm currently looking for one right now.

So I want to officially get out of academia and work full time, until I'm ready to go back to college. **If that's enough information for you, then go ahead and comment, but if you want some more info on the situation, feel free to look at a LOOOONG list of pros and cons I typed out.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 1. I owe nearly 20,000 in student loans that I'm currently paying a small interest off of. Both the government and state of New Jersey will spike up the interest rates on my loans like crazy (ok really more the state of NJ, man this state sucks) if I don't attend a college at least part time.           

2. I can't get a refund anymore for this fall semester, I owe what I owe and I have to finish paying off my payment plan (at least its a community college tuition and not uber expensive private christian university tuition) whether I finish the semester until December or not.

3. Let us address the fact that I am an impulsive, anxious person that turns things into nightmare scenarios and always looks for the easiest way out, usually by quitting. 

4.My career goals will become ever farther and harder to reach. I'm nervous about delaying my future career into the unforeseeable future.

**Pros:** 1. Even though I LOVE the material in these classes (General Psychology and Music History) It's been a terrible semester already and it's just started, it would be stupid to not recognize I'm worse off than before and need to bail NOW. 

2. I have a steady job that I really like and have a great relationship with my coworkers and managers. 

3. I could work more rather than study and so pay off those loans quicker over time. 

4. I've been dealing with a lot of personal/spiritual stuff so its no wonder things are going bad, my mind is in too many places. And that's already its default mode so my thinking has been getting REALLY out there now.

5. I've been ignoring hobbies I love, like reading philosophy and science, running (I used to love to run my brains out, but now I'm an unhealthy sofa spud), playing music, hanging out with friends, and dedicating much needed time to my family. Maybe that's why it seems my depression has only been getting worse. I did the same stuff last year in college as well. Completely ignoring everything I liked doing and trying (but failing) to focus everything on work/school.

6. I haven't even come close to figuring out how to manage my ADHD, how to study, or other stuff that I should learn properly to become an adult. Struggling with school is only gonna slow that down, if not make it worse. Me not having managed my ADHD also makes me struggle with school even more. Fun viscous cycle there right?

7. My future is pretty undetermined, really. I don't HAVE to go to college, get a degree, and start my lifelong career. I don't have to even stick to this career as I move on in life. I recognize that there are more important things to me and I can change who I am whenever the time is right, whenever I want.

It's nothing but a hellpit of misery and financial drain. I've spent thousands of dollars and for what? Nothing. It's hard as fuck, expensive as hell, and all you get from it is some fucking piece of paper. 

My parents forced me to go and I crashed and burned in my third year so hard a teacher told me to stop coming to class out of pity for how poorly I was doing in it. I blew through 20,000 dollars only to realize I didn't even know what I wanted to do and ended up declaring no major so I just quit going and lied to my parents that I was (and still am lying to them to this day). It just sucks. Everything about it is awful. The work, the reliance on self-sufficiency, everything. I miss high school. I really do. At least in high school everything was done for you. I hate being on this awful fucking campus and seeing all these awful happy people content with their education. Makes me want to fucking throw up, jesus. 

I don't have a car or a license nor have I ever held a job so I can't pay for college without throwing myself down a hellpit of debt for some shitty paper (not like I even know what kind of shitty paper I want).

350,KTStephano,1535435469,/r/college/comments/9awdir/a_collection_of_college_epiphanies/,"Hi everyone. I wanted to go through some of some of my hard-earned lessons in college that I wish I had known going in. These were mostly gained by having a bad experience, reflecting on it, and then trying not to have that bad experience twice. I think it’s important to reflect on the important experiences we have, good or bad, and decide what to do with what they taught us. Then later on you can use that knowledge to help others too!

# Teachers can make you dumber

It’s not that you can just get bad teachers, you can get teachers that actually leave you knowing less than before. One example I had was a particular professor who explained things… wrong. If not wrong, just badly. He would either leave out details resulting in a leap of logic, or give you incorrect information.

He once spent 2 class periods lecturing over something he didn’t understand, and ultimately got wrong. The only way I know is because one of my friends emailed him to ask if he knew, and he admitted that he had messed it up. Another time he explained something I already knew and somehow confused me.

The key is to try and find every teacher on [ratemyprofessor](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) before you sign up. Worst case, if you can’t avoid the teacher, you’ll just have to teach yourself the material alongside the class to avoid falling behind people who *didn’t* have that teacher.

# Not every class is worth attending

I hate to say this one since classes are expensive, but it’s true. For one of my required credits, only one of the times worked for my schedule, so I had no choice but to keep it.

This was the class format: every day was study guide review day. She emailed the study guide for test 1 on day 1, and then went over it (and it alone) until the actual test. Upon completing test 1, she emailed the test 2 study guide…

It was better just to stay home and ready the study guide. They weren’t even that big, so you could just not do anything until a few days before.

# There are a lot of bad textbooks

For my major, there were a fair number of classes that required textbooks, but did not end up using them for their problem sets - just the material they covered. Because of this, you could just not buy them and find a better resource.

Solution? Never buy books before classes start unless you have a reason to. If you find yourself in the situation I described above, you can look around and find reviews for the book. If people say stuff like “explanations are hard to follow”, “diagrams are all blurry and hard to read”, “\*X\* book is better”, then you know what to do.

# College bookstores are expensive

I can’t tell you how many times the college campus was selling books at ripoff prices. Consider

* Buying from somewhere else
* Renting ebook version

At the very least, mark down all the college prices and search other vendors that have the same book before you buy. This way you know if they’re trying to rip you off or not.

# There are a lot of messed up weighted grading schemes

Always check and double check your syllabus to see how much things are worth. I once had a class where me and my group of friends spent enormous amounts of time on the often lengthy and very confusing homeworks. We would try to get everything to be as correct as possible only to lose points here and there anyway.

How much were they ALL worth in total? 20%. The other 80% were tests that came directly from content in his slides/lecture notes. The point was, we could have spent most of our time practicing the material in his notes, almost no time on the lengthy homeworks, and had a much easier time.

# Group projects are scary

This is especially true when you’re new in college and don’t have many friends and the professor lets you pick your group.

My first semester of college, our final project had to be done in groups. Not knowing many people, I asked two others who sat near me if they wanted to partner up.

This didn’t go well. One of them didn’t actually know any of the material and the other turned out to be a potential danger to himself and others which I found out later. I looked him up on Facebook to find that he only had 1 friend and constantly posted very suspicious things. Luckily nothing happened during the project, but I really hope he sought help.

# Group projects are awesome

The opposite is also true if you manage to find some people who have the same outlook on school as you. My last few semesters of college were spent working with people who liked to put about the same amount of effort in as I did, so all of our group work went smoothly. We got along great too, so it was constant fun. I’ll remember those as being my best moments in college no doubt.

**Lots of people are looking for new friends until the bitter end**

It was always hard talking to other people, even to ask if they wanted to form a study group. This actually got worse towards my last few semesters when I mistakenly figured that everyone already had an established group of friends for their classes.

To my surprise, there were always people in my same boat. Oftentimes going up and asking if they wanted to work together to pass the class would be met with *“YES!!!!! I mean cool, sure.”* types of answers.

So talk to your neighbor. Like, tomorrow seriously. Especially if you don’t see them talking to other people before/after class.

# Too many people rush everywhere and miss a lot

I used to be really bad at this. I’d show up right on time, if not a little late. Once class was out I was gone within 5 seconds and off to my next one, even if it was close by. When my last class ended I would take the quickest route to my car to leave.

It’s surprising how lonely this can make you. Aside from joining clubs or other organizations, simply sticking around as long as you can sometimes makes it easier to meet people. After classes are done, consider going to the dining halls to read or do homework, but try not to look closed off. You’ll run into a lot more people and campus activities this way.

# Internships are great

You don’t need to worry about having one right away, but look into them even if your program doesn’t mention them. They are a good way to gain real-world experience before you leave and they make it easier to find a job after you graduate.

One of my friends was having some trouble with his job search after graduation. Then he remembered that he had interned at one of the local companies a few years back. He called up someone he still had contact info for, they set up an interview, and he got hired really fast afterwards.

# Community colleges can help even if you’re enrolled in a larger University

The University classes were always expensive, the campus intimidating and the parking situation horrendous.

But they also had a set of pre-approved credits that could be done at the local CC and moved over. These classes were comparatively inexpensive, the application process was laid-back (some offer Guest status if you just plan on taking a couple credits), and it is often easy to get the parking figured out.

I wish I had taken more credits at a CC and transferred them.

# Your campus might be mental-health-aware

For whatever reason, I had no idea that my campus offered free counseling services for students who were having a hard time. For the first 2 years I had no idea, but then one of my friends told me he had gone to a couple sessions when he was in really bad shape mentally. They charged him nothing and he felt better.

Look into it if you haven’t.

# Talk to your professors

I really regret this. For my first couple of years, I liked to solve all my own problems with a combination of books and online resources, or even people I knew that had a better understanding than me. While this was all great, there was one thing I rarely ever did: talk to the professor. Even the ones I liked!

Well, fast forward a few years. I met some new people, and they had been much more adamant about getting to know their professors. One thing lead to another and they found themselves working with that teacher on one of their personal research ventures. Another friend even ended up being part of their professor’s startup company! They formed friendships that transcended the classroom.

There is so much more to be gained than just going to their lectures.

# Pay attention to any “food shops” on campus

So there was one particular food shop on my school’s campus that, on the outside at least, looked like a condensed version of a Market Walmart. They had pre-packaged food, drinks and microwaves.

But it had more than just food and drink. In the back they sold a host of common medications (advil, tylenol, anti-allergy), as well as other health-related products for both men and women.

Check and see if your campus has the same thing. Chances are you might not have to make a pitstop at Walgreens after all.

# Sleep is better than coffee

I used to average 2-4 hours per night and then drink coffee all day to stay awake. Sure, I got a lot of extra hours to work, but at what cost?! I felt awful every single day, and I would sleep 15 hours a day during weekends to catch up so I had very little time to do much outside of school.

The trick is to do more with less. Less hours awake, but more productive ones. The rest are spent sleeping.

I'm looking into going to one of the CUNY schools for teaching, but I live in New Jersey and there doesn't really seem to be a point in paying that expensive ass out-of-state tuition to go. Now, I know that setting up a residency in New York takes 12 months, and I'm considering moving there and working for a year before starting college, but I've been informed that since I'm a dependent, my parents' state of residency is what matters. My parents are keeping their assess in Jersey, so my question is: is there any way I can maintain a dependent status and qualify for in-state tuition in New York (also for financial aid like TAP and the Excelsior Scholarship). I'm trying to do something more practical than going to an art school like Pratt or SVA that I can't afford because my family is too low-income (I think teaching and pursuing art on the side in a city where I can network is the current game plan).

354,lacroixalty,1533760002,/r/college/comments/95pppu/the_college_guide_for_poor_kids/,"hi r/college!

After browsing this thread for a while and also just searching online, I realized that while there’s an abundant amount of information and college survival tips/guides for the average college student, there’s hardly any for *actual* poor students and students of immigrants/first gen kids. After three frustrating years at Boston University, a seemingly progressive private institution that basically just discriminates against its lower income students, I decided to create my own guide as a lower income student who is a child of a single parent immigrant for anyone who might be facing the same experiences or about to enter college. Feel more than free to enter your own tips and/or experiences! 

1. Work Study: Most lower income students qualify for work study, and while its a good federal aid opportunity, I quickly realized after my freshman year that you don’t really get paid enough to live because there’s a cap on the amount of hours you can work, especially if your parents can’t afford to give you some spending money too. I recommend getting a second job if possible, and either working very little hours through work study, or forfeiting it altogether. 
2. Financial aid: You’d think schools would be more willing to help lower income students who are already enrolled but that’s just not the case. If you ever find yourself needing more money from the school, I highly recommend appealing for more (even if its a small amount). If they deny your appeal, keep calling the office. I have a friend who even emailed our financial aid office once and talked about his deteriorating mental health as a way to guilt trip them into giving more aid. 
3. Discrimination: The funny thing about my school (and probably all seemingly “progressive” institutions) is that they try to hide how discriminatory they are. This year, and every year for the past three years, I was “randomly” selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you’re only targeting low income students. Little things like this are the just some points of discrimination I and many others face every year at private institutions. 
4. Health Insurance: If like mine, your parents are immigrants and don’t qualify for health insurance, the odds are that your school will try to force you to pay for their student insurance plan. That would be fine, if said insurance plans didn’t cost thousands of dollars, which is kind of contradictory if you can’t afford health insurance, or tuition, to begin with. I didn’t realize until this year that there’s an easy loophole around this if you’re able to find a part or full time job that offers health insurance, which is helpful to begin with if you already plan on getting a job in addition or in lieu of work study. 
5. Housing: I lived in on campus housing for the first two years of college, and then decided to move off campus. Many other low income students I know fear doing the same because of student housing scholarships, which is fair, but what I’ve found is that living off campus is for the most part still cheaper than living on campus with a housing scholarship. If you also get federal aid, that money can also be refunded back to you to pay for the cost of rent. At the end of the day, paying around the same to live off campus and have your own room, kitchen, privacy etc will always be better than living on campus and sharing a room with someone in a dorm that hasn’t been renovated in 50 years. 
6. Friends/Socializing: This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with, because I’m constantly surrounded by middle class and to upper class kids who complain about how poor they are and how expensive school is. Yes, school totally is expensive. But I can’t pity someone who comes from a well off family when mine can barely afford rent let alone put me through school. (Seriously, I once had a girl complain to me about how her family makes 100K so she doesnt get any federal aid and so “in a lot of ways college is harder for middle class students than poor ones”). Its also hard when your friends parents pay for all their ubers and they can afford to go out almost every day and you can’t. My best advice is to not try to follow that lifestyle if/when you can’t. It sucks, but unless you want to work like a dog to be able to afford it, it really isn’t worth it. 
7. Parents: If you’re a first gen college student, especially if your parents arent from this country, there’s a weird phenomena that happens in college where you kind of feel caught between worlds. There’s the world of poverty you feel like you belong to, and then there’s the world of academia and security that you’re introduced to. In a way its alienating, because you can’t really even turn to your parents for guidance since they haven’t experienced it. You can’t ask your parents about motifs in *The Great Gatsby* if they’ve never read *The Great Gatsby*. This is actually still something I struggle with, but the longer I’ve been in school, the more I’ve been able to find people in a similar boat. We’re all sinking together. 
8. Major: This is similar to the above. There’s a huge pressure, once again especially if you’re the child of immigrants, to study something lucrative in college so you can make more money and rectify their choices/emigration. That’s perfect if you naturally excel and want to study engineering, but it can lead to so much anxiety if you want to study something related to the arts or humanities. My best advice is to study what *you* like and what makes you happy even if your parents don’t approve, because at the end of the day its your life. Additionally, it can still be difficult to pursue the arts in school because, at least in my experience, most kids who do study something in the arts are the ones who can afford to, meaning they have their parents to fall back on and pay their rent even if they dont excel after college. Or, their parents have the ability to help them out after school with industry connections. 
9. Student Organizations: One thing I’ve found after joining a fraternity is that dues are super high and you can’t always afford them even if you’re working. This is even harder if you can’t ask your parents for financial help, so apply for all the inter-organization scholarships you can, or try to talk to the leader of whatever organization you’re apart of about lowering your dues.
10. Textbooks: Split the cost with a friend! Check the university library because they often have a copy of whatever book you need! Then photocopy the book or ask to borrow a copy from your classmate and then photocopy theirs! Yeah its time consuming, but textbooks are super expensive and this is a virtually free way to get them. I haven’t had to encounter any online textbooks that *require*  you to buy them, but I would also talk to the professor of whatever course you’re taking and explain the situation. They’re a lot more understanding than the university as a whole.
11. Food: Ask your friends who have meal plans to swipe you in! Buy in bulk! Trader Joe’s is cheap and incredible! I also recommend buying groceries every two or three days instead of weekly to avoid waste of food and money. 
12. Mental Health: Even today its still kinda taboo to discuss mental health, and i felt weird mentioning that i go to therapy until this year when i realized a lot of my other friends do too. don’t hesitate to go, even though i know how hard it is to take the first step. More often than not, whatever insurance you’re on covers most or all of your outpatient costs, and if its still too expensive, most universities offer on campus licensed mental health professionals at little to no cost. One of the perks of being in a high stress environment. 

That’s all for now but I will definitely update if i think of anything else. Apologies if any of this comes off as bitter or spiteful towards anyone who isn’t from a low income/international fam, I love everyone regardless but it can definitely be isolating to only see middle class and upper class experiences discussed in both this thread and around you at school.

I was discussing the 3 transfers plan and my boyfriend expressed his doubts that it would be that easy to transfer that many times. Lowering that to transferring twice however will lead to me having a 40 minute drive to the my next school until I am able to move closer.

I'm in my first community college atm, which has become too expensive for me. So there are two others that I'm looking at transferring that are equally more affordable. I'm also planning on moving closer to the city near me once I have the money for it. One possible school is already near me, but once I move closer to the city soon I would have to transfer to the community college there. The other is a 40 minute drive from me now, but I will be near it once I move.

And then after whichever of those I choose, I've always planned on ending up transferring to and graduating from a state school, which is already in the city/ same area of the 3rd school I'm moving near.

I thought the transferring three times would worth avoiding a horrible commute to classes, but since I've never transferred schools before, I wanted to get more opinions on if transferring is difficult enough to be worth driving that far.

359,CapriciousSalmon,1531794773,/r/college/comments/8zhbz6/an_important_lesson_for_all_incoming_freshmen_on/,"To all of you coming to college in the fall with the intention of living here, I’m sure you’re all excited. You get freedom, and a chance at adulthood. 

This summer, I’ve had the chance to have a trial college run in my new college based upon this state run program, courtesy of New Jersey. So far, I’ve learned how to make my bed, how to make a paper, and how to poop.

When you’re at home, you tend to poop freely. At school you tend to stop, because it’s disgusting and people tend to be dirty pigs. From experience, I never went in a public bathroom at school. I just used the English Department’s bathroom, because I was really close with them and the VP didn’t care if a student asked. But most of the time, I would only go in the morning, when I first woke up, and then once I got home at 5. But that was still bad. You might live at college from August to Thanksgiving. Or you might stay during the week and go home on the weekends on laundry. Regardless, that’s five days. You should get used to it. 

My first week at college was hard, and pun intended. But I found ways around it.

There’s some things you should do:

1. Poop alone. Sometimes you won’t feel as self conscious if you have an audience. You should try to go during times when not a lot of people have breaks, like at night when everybody is partying or during class times. Say everybody on your phone has an 8 AM class, go then. Put on music or a tv show if you have to, so you forget you’re not in a communal bathroom. Don’t worry. They get cleaned on the reg, and everybody understands to clean up after them self. Only, the ones in the classrooms might not, especially if you take summer courses where 100 kids out of a 2,000 school are taking classes. My school rented out space to a day camp with the YMCA, like the pool and a science lab, so the bathrooms in one building did look like toddlers had been through it. Don’t worry though, as they aren’t usually like that. There will be that occasional person who doesn’t flush, but it’s really far between.

2. Drink a lot of soda/Gatorade/energy drinks. I’m not joking. That’s how I got me to poop. Took me days to do. At the designated mealtimes, I would drink regular Pepsi (were a Pepsi school sorry) and then at night during study hall, run to poop. Just be warned, if you drink too much, it turns your poop moss green and stinky. Try a cup or two, not the entire bottle day after day. Also, soda at college is expensive. A bottle in the vending machine, for me, was two dollars, while it was free in the mess hall (and you get unlimited drinks) and one dollar at the Rite Aid by my house. Also, for girls, be warned that those girly things are expensive. It was two dollars for a regular tampon. Bring your own. Campus might seem like a bubble, especially in rural or suburban areas, but they have ways around it.

3. Poop when you have to. From experience, I can tell you that if you let it accumulate and just wait until class ends, you’ll end up taking fifteen minutes, sitting on the toilet, sweating and in pain. The reason? I always thought I would miss something so I would stay in class and wait until I got back to my dorm. While I still tend to do it, I try my hardest to stop.

4. Poop after you eat. While it might seem like you’re a bulimic, it works. At home, I would always poop after I had a big meal, as it emptied me out and made more room. College isn’t like high school: if you have to use the bathroom, just leave. Most professors don’t care if you’re out for 15 minutes, as it might be a hike (for me it was) or you might be constipated or whatnot. Just don’t miss the entire lesson. If you just had lunch and now have to take English 101, wait for the teacher to give directions and then go. Just, don’t miss the whole lesson, or don’t poop if it’s a difficult class, like a remedial math or a chemistry course for an English major. You could end up missing something important. I always try to go after I finish my work, like after a test.

5. Try to eat poop foods. In addition to soda, there’s other things you can try: oatmeal, beans, broccoli, nuts, berries, tacos, apples, popcorn. It might depend on your cafeteria though. My school is small, so we only have one, and it’s usually only a few foods. However, we are allowed to order out. Know that college towns tend to have a lot of foods, like Chipotle, Taco Bell, etc. many of which are rich in poop foods. 

6. Force yourself to poop. If all else fails, sit on the toilet and poop. I would only advise against it if you are in class, or if there’s a line in the bathroom. You’ll either miss work or you’ll make others miss it.

360,yawnmasta,1531784952,/r/college/comments/8zg5ic/advice_for_college_firstyears/,"I wrote this a while ago, intending it to send it to someone. Unfortunately, we despise each other now. But I didn’t want to waste this so I’m posting it here.

BOOKS:

Books in university are a massive money pit. I’ve heard of people spending close to a thousand on supplies and materials per semester. The reason being is that these books are extremely price gouging. New books typically cost upwards $100. What typically happens is that schools will attach an access code to the book where you will do your homework online. These access codes will cost between $50 and $120 in my experience. 

Suppose you go to the school’s book store and buy a new textbook and the access code. For some, it’d be easier to explain with the tangible example of my Gen. Chem 1 class. At my school, the textbook and the access code together were $300 new. I only paid $100. How? I bought an older edition of the book for $20 on Amazon and then went online and bought the access code from the site directly for $80. A really big price-gouging method that I’ve noticed is that schools will cut a book in half and sell them separately to two different classes. The first half of my $20 older and used book was completely identical the new textbook used in my Gen. Chem 1 class. The second half was completely identical to the Gen. Chem 2 class’s text book.

For classes like biology and chemistry, you’ll also need to buy supplies. Such as lab coats, goggles, etc. At the book store, you’ll find that they are extremely expensive here as well. You can spend $20 on goggles when you can spend far less at an equipment/tool store nearby. I saved almost a hundred dollars doing this.

Absolutely do not buy your books before class starts unless your professor has told you to buy these books and have them ready before class. What typically happens is that the first day of classes, the professor will go over the syllabus, then if there’s any time left they will start a lecture. However, you will not need a textbook for this. The professor will inform you of what you will need for the course, so you should buy the materials when you know you need them. If you run around buying textbooks from older students, you will get price-gouged. A student can sell you a $120 Physics textbook and tell you that he spent $200, but in reality, there’s an $80 access code that you will need to buy later.

If you like PDFs, pirate your books. I probably can’t link sites here, but you can find them fairly easily. 

CLASSES:

Do your research. Is this going to be a hard class? Is this class going to have a high workload? How much extra credit will be given out in this class? Will your grades be mostly determined by homework or tests? Most of this you can find through the syllabus. You can also ask older students for advice on the classes. If you plan on dorming, this can be quite easy. If you take some STEM classes like Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry, you’ll find that plenty of students will have taken those classes you’ve taken already and can give you advice. 

Build a study habit. Even if it seems too easy to study for. Build your studying habit. You do not want to get into more difficult and complex classes with the same “oh this is easy, I don’t really need to study. I can go goof off!” attitude. And if you do reach those classes with that attitude, it is very hard to break. So start early, begin studying. Build your discipline.

One thing that people don’t typically take advantage of are office hours. Got a question? Go office hours or email the professor. One very important advice is to go to office hours if you’re majoring in the department that the professor is in. By going to office hours consistently, the professor gets to know who you are. And if you’re in the same department, that is a massive bonus because if the professor likes you, you can use him/her as a reference or letter of recommendation to a program or job.

CAREER:

Building off of office hours, you should be looking at internships in the field you want to go to. Ask your professors if they know of any reputable internships around. If you share an amicable relationship with your professor, you can ask him/her to write a letter of recommendation or refer you to the program.

The internship will help you figure out if you actually want to continue in this field. I did an internship and realized that what I wanted wasn’t actually the complex and abstract but rather the practical applications. And so I changed my major from Physics to Computer Science.

Should you get into the internship, try to keep an amicable and competent relationship with your supervisor. Your supervisor will now serve to be an effective and very important reference in the future. Not only that, the people you meet will be apart of your network. You can ask these people for job opportunities in the future or as references to other jobs.

Apply to scholarships, as many as you can. Take the time to write essays that sell yourself (not literally) to the scholarship. You’re essentially taking an hour out of your day to apply to some scholarships that may or may not make you anywhere upward a few hundred dollars.

Figure out if you plan on going into a graduate program. Build your extracurricular classes to fit into those. Are you certain that you’ll get into this one program? Well fuck you because there’s no guarantee you’ll get into that one. Go apply to other programs and look at their requirements. The sooner you do, the more prepared you will be. Study for the exam you’ll need whether it be the MCAT or GRE or whatever.

Thoughts of homelessness have crossed my mind but now it´s moving into serious consideration. Is it realistic for me to consider living in my car for a semester? Has anyone here lived in their car or crashed at someone else´s for any amount of time during college?

Here's my deal. I´m moving to attend a CSU in California this fall. I´ve taken out a loan for tuition and between working minimum wage, rent at my parent’s place I have around $1500 in savings. I have a 10 year old car that runs very well. About 100K on it. Rent where I'm headed is $450-$700 mo if I´m lucky. Not that the area is expensive to live in, but housing is super competitive, especially for students, and housing and employment I've found are a huge problem in the area. It´s just insane to me how I´ve found myself in this situation. I was a decent student at my HS, good student in community college, a 3.3 GPA, good credit, never had any scholarships, passionate about the field I´m entering, of course people that doubt it, I work, pay for my own shit, take responsibility for everything I do. Not usually one to play victim but it’s all kinda catching up with me. Irrelevant, but anyway.. I have about a month before school starts and I want to know if I´m crazy or not. I came up with a budget. For 12 months, August 2018-2019, not including tuition I would be paying $600/mo in rent plus a $1k deposit, $130/mo in car insurance, $50/mo for my phone, $150 in food, and let´s say $100/mo for everything else.. Books, gas, etc. might be underestimating a little bit, but that´ll cost me around $11k for the entire school year including summer. Let me repeat, this isn´t including tuition. $6K-$7k of this would be for rent!! Am I batshit crazy for thinking I don´t want to pay for this? I´d never see this money again. I´d much rather invest this into something that I´ll see later on. I´m not interested in taking a year off, always been afraid of dropping out and finding myself stuck in a job I hate. I clearly don't want to wind up in a spiral of debt. My parents are a whole other issue.. Long story, but they cannot help me. My dad is old, divorced from my mom, financially irresponsible with nothing left from a high status government career, got scammed, now has hand tremors and showing early signs of Parkinson´s, which has done a lot of damage to me mentally and emotionally trying to care for him. I developed some pretty bad anxiety over there with only him. My mom is in decent financial shape, she bought the car that is now mine, but has been loaning my financially insane sister money for her rent. My father was supposed to help me out… he defaulted on loans after my sister dropped out of school. I´m a dependent of my mother, for financial aid as well, but I don´t have the best relationship with her. Long story too.. But she might be my best bet at help. It´s all complicated and I feel like it´s all my fault. Should have worked more in high school, figured things out earlier.. Sigh. But now I really need to find a way out of this mess. Back to this fall. Again, theoretically it sounds reasonable because I´m a backpacker and have slept in my car some nights. I don´t know anymore. I feel crazy for all of this. I thought about it all day. I can shower at my school for free, use the wifi and library for free, work out at the gym, work would be super close to campus, and there´s a laundromat in town. But practically speaking, there are huge questions for me. Storing food, parking, privacy, a buttload of more issues most likely. I´m typing this as if I believe in what I´m saying but I´m really just trying to hide how crazy I really feel for actually believing in this all. Is it possible? What should I do? I really don´t want any hate, should´ves, or negative criticism, I already do plenty of that on my own. But I really want to change my life around financially, mentally and go on to do some big things for myself and others. This is the first time truly and honestly reaching out for some help… so I´m just looking for some guidance, support, ideas, someone to tell me I’m overthinking all of this, anxiety getting the best of me, and need to just take out a loan, maybe even a good kick in the ass might help.

I applied to multiple US universities, and got accepted to all of them, but received no financial aid. I've now been looking at the possibility of attending a university abroad.

My plan, prior to realizing the cost of university here, was to major in physics/math, and try to do undergrad research. If I liked doing the research, I would apply to a US PhD program. If I didn't like the research or field, I might have applied to graduate school to a new field (CompSci, EE, Math, etc) or tried to get a job immediately.

I'm thinking about various universities in the Netherlands (University of Groningen), Beligum (KU Leuven), Russia (Moscow State University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology), as well as numerous universities in Germany (TUM, Heidelberg) and France. The only English taught program is at Groningen. The rest are in a foreign language, and I have to reside abroad and learn the language first, probably in a year. I couldn't find any other English programs that weren't too expensive.

If I go to undergrad abroad, I'd still want to apply to US PhD programs (although I would also consider doing a masters+PhD in other countries instead), mostly since I'd prefer to work in the USA after graduation. I've also thought it would be cool to work at a national lab or private corporation which may require a security clearance. I don't know if getting my bachelors abroad may end up hurting my changes of a security clearance - especially if I go to one of the universities in Moscow.

My questions/concerns:

- How do US universities (or employers) generally view a foreign degree?
- Would the physics program being 3 years rather than 4 be an issue in any way?
- Would learning physics in a foreign/non-native language be too arduous a task?
- If grad school doesn't work out, would getting a job with a foreign physics bachelors be difficult?

My biggest issue is my inability to commit due to my many interests which include computer science, biology, psychology, history and a few more. Though my biggest dream, if you want, is actually to be a filmmaker. I'm just extremely confused and don't know what next steps I can take. I can't take classes for fun exploring other subjects since it's expensive and I already did by electives. I suppose my best option is to get involved in some sort of interdisciplinary research between CS and a subject I'm interested in while trying to make a step towards film on the side? 

I just get really stressed when I think about my career and future as if I feel I'm wasting all my opportunities and this leads me to inaction and escapism.

First year, first generation student here. I started my first year of CC, and fell in love with it. On September 30th (mid 1st semester) I was in a semi severe car accident that left a small financial burden on me. Luckily insurance covered a fair amount, and I even called my mom to take me to the hospital because ambulances were expensive. Well I lost my job because of the incident, so medical costs were handled by my savings. The injury kept me out of class for 3 weeks, and with no internet/computer I had no options of viewing online lecture slides. I dropped 2 of my 4 classes because I knew I fell too far behind. I have a documented email to one of my professors detailing the injury, and my struggle to make up for lost work. 

Second semester rolled around and I had no money, and no job. I enrolled for classes because I was too prideful to take a semester off to find work and save up, and it killed me. I couldn't pay for books and again, I dropped classes stupidly, not knowing I was on probation. 

That leads us to now. I plan on appealing it. I am motivated and love school. There is one problem though. Obtaining my medical records will take up to 30 days. My registration date is the 26th, and would love to get the classes that offer me the most success. So I come to you reddit. Do appeals ever even work? I have billing info of only my physical therapy, an email detailing the injury, photos from the scene, and my notes and essays (showing I am an engaged student). Should I go now, and inform them of that any awaiting medical information can be provided, or do I wait until I get it?

I have fairly severe Attention Deficit Disorder and Depression that comes in waves. I've signed up for accommodation support through my school to assist me in this and to have it on file. 

Now to the real story.

In my first year of college my medication was too expensive to afford, as I HAD to buy the name brand stuff and my insurance deductible wasn't paid. That's $300 out of pocket. This put me in a tight spot. I wasn't taking school as seriously as I should have, and I was working a lot and going to school full time. The high school I went to did not give the ACT resources I needed to take that, so I had to take the accuplacer test through my college to better gauge me for my prerequisites and generals. I scored highly but failed in math and had to take Pre Algebra. On my first year I got a couple incompletes and failed 2 classes as well, which this caused my GPA to plummit. The weight of being full time college and 35+ hours a week in work was too much for me to handle and because of this year of failed classes I ended up getting suspended for a semester. I appealed and came back only to do poorly again in one class. My GPA cumulative rating ended up being .889 before my suspension. This academic probation also limited me to only being able to take 6 credits. This meant I had to boost my GPA cumulatively all the way to 2.0 while boosting my semester and cumulative completion rate to at least 60% (which I did) all within 2 classes. This is not possible. This issue, despite me doing so well on my recovery semester, caused me to be suspended again, along with removing my ability to get financial aid. At this point I'm wondering if I should change schools or if I should go through with the appeal process and hope they lift all the restrictions on my classes so I can get to the threshold. My cumulative GPA ending on the semester after my 2nd suspension was 1.875. just barely under what I needed. Semester GPA was 3.2

368,jgh713,1526326466,/r/college/comments/8jf595/an_education_in_shambles_please_advise/,"Hi.

So, I'm not going to sugar-coat it. I fucked up. Big time.

Lets start in high school. Graduating with a 3.8+ GPA, 2180 on the SATs, breezing through classes, taking career prep (engineering and CS) courses. Not a care in the world. Took a trip Junior year to tour Stanford (as well as my #2 and #3 choices, CalTech and Cal Poly), and everything seemed good.

Fast forward five years, I'm sitting at home, unemployed, my education in shambles, struggling with mental illness, and have no clue what to do at this point.

It started when I missed the application deadline for Stanford. I probably wouldn't have gotten in, but hey, it was my dream, and at least I could have said that I tried. After that point, I decided to go to a local 4-year university (U. Texas at Arlington), as they're a decent school, not too far of a commute, and not ridiculously expensive. I commuted for a year, then lived on campus for a year. At that point, everything fell apart.

*Fall of 2013*

My first semester. Things were fine. I commuted to classes, got my ass kicked by a few professors while trying to come to grips with the transition from high school to college. Ended up with a 2.0 gpa my first semester. Not great, but not unheard of, and still passing.

*Spring 2014*

My second semester of commuting. I flunk one class, then get Cs across the board, bringing my gpa down to 1.85. 

*Summer 2014*

I take some summer courses at a local community college. Get the easy courses out of the way. I'm still slightly together at this point, and these classes are basically show up and pass, so I A/B/B across the board. In hindsight, I should have waited and taken them at the university, to have some hope of pulling my GPA back up, but we're long past that point now.

*Fall 2014*

I move into the dorms. Start living on campus. At this point my ADHD and severe depression kick into overdrive. I stop attending classes after a point in the semester. Stop tending to my health and hygiene. .462 gpa for the semester, bringing me down to a 1.4.

*Spring 2015*

Still living on campus. My roommate is the nicest guy, but probably thinks I'm horrid to live with. Not because I'm an asshole, just because I don't take care of anything. Most of my waking hours are spent wasting away on the computer, either watching endless tv series or playing video games. I fail every single class, mostly because I've stopped caring. My gpa is now at a 1.077, and I am put on dismissal for a semester.

*Summer 2015* 

Take four summer courses at TCC (the aforementioned community college). Withdrawn from all but one for non-attendance. Get a C in the one class I'm not withdrawn from, because I actually enjoyed the teacher. It's somewhere around this point (give or take six months) where my already very very part time job starts to go downhill, and my hours worked go from minimal to nonexistent.

*Fall 2015*

Still on dismissal (one long term, i.e. spring or fall, not just one term), so I take some more courses at TCC. Four courses. Pass three. Fail one (but this one's due to the professor who threatened to file a police report and haul me down to campus police for correcting him in class. no joke. but that's a story for a different time).

*Spring 2016*

Hey, a fresh start! Not really though. Once more, I fail every single class, bringing my gpa at UTA down to 0.848. Aaaaaand, I'm on academic dismissal for a whole 'nother year. So now I'm three years in, on dismissal for the next year, and have completed a total of 28 credit hours at UTA, with some additionals from TCC. Lovely.

Silver lining, this is the semester during which I actually seek help from a medical professional. I've spoken to those close to me (as few as they may be at this point, as I've neglected my social life as much as the rest of my life at this point), I'm on medication to help manage my issues, and I'm also eating less and getting back towards a healthy weight (slowly but surely). But we'll come back to that.

*Summer 2016*

Welp. Back to TCC I suppose. Start working towards that 2-year degree during my fourth year of schooling. Take three classes. Pass two. PhysEd instructor has a thing for pilates and the class starts at 7:30 in the morning, so I said fuck that. Sue me.

*Fall 2016*

Slowly struggling to come to terms with what's happened. Take two classes, pass one, fail the other. Don't even remember why.

*Spring 2017*

Three classes, all passed. Only two courses away from an Associates. Things are looking up!

*Summer 2017*

Took my last two classes. Realized I only needed one of them. Thought I dropped the other, turns out I didn't, so I failed one. But hey, no biggie, summer's over and I've finally got a degree after four years and three months!

*Fall 2017*

Was too late at this point to return to UTA for the fall, so I took a semester off. And by that, I mean I fell off the bandwagon. I stopped taking my meds for several months, and most of my waking hours were spent trying to kill time until I finally got back to the blissful release of sleep.

Towards the end of the semester, I get in touch with UTA, preparing to return in the spring. Am given the runaround for awhile, but finally set up a meeting with a counsellor and talk in person. He basically tells me that at this point, I'll be returning on a provisionary basis, if I fuck up one semester I'm out for good, which I expected. However, I'd also have to go through the University Studies program, which (in his words) is a program for people to get degrees who otherwise wouldn't be able to get those degrees. I'd be spending two more years struggling to pull my GPA out of the trash so that I could even graduate (which he said would probably be possible, but incredibly difficult), all to graduate with a generic degree that's really not going to help me at all. So at this point, what little remains of my plans is just shattered.

*Spring 2017*

So here we are. Me. A several year gap with no work experience. Nothing but a two-year degree and two shitty GPAs to show for it. No clothes for a professional work environment. (That's not entirely true, I have one suit from goodwill with patched holes, and one white dress shirt that you can see through and that's so tight No clue what to do now. I barely have $100 in my bank account (taking into account credit card debt totals me out at about -$1100, actually), so I can't do as people keep telling me and just apply to whatever colleges will take me ($75 application fee on a Texas CommonApp college, seriously UNT?). Hell, even online universities have turned me away out of hand because of my GPA, despite being in direct contact with advisors and filling out supplementary application information and forms to explain my situation and the troubles I've gone through, and honestly I just don't think I can handle much more rejection, be it for schools, jobs, personal interactions, or what have you.

So, yeah. Long story short, I'm a self-taught programmer who can type at 90 words per minute, am a fast learner with a thirst for knowledge, have above-average skill in writing, mathematics, and logical reasoning, and utterly fucked my life up with a 4-year university gpa of 0.84 before being told to shove it, a 2.3 gpa for my Associates from a community college, a multiple-year gap in my employment history (none of which is really applicable to any place I'd ever possibly hope to work), and absolutely zero idea what the fuck to do. I'm so tired of filling out job applications, putting in (sometimes, depending on the job) upwards of an hour just modifying resumes and writing cover letters, and not even hearing back from a place, or getting a two-sentence generic reply. I've spent the past five months sitting at home going back and forth between filling out applications to places I've never heard of and trying to kill the time until I get to just lay down in bed and not worry about things for awhile, mostly either through video games or shitty tv shows. All I want is to be able to support myself. That's all I've ever wanted. Well, that and maybe a dog someday. But, jokes aside, I really just can't do it anymore, and I don't know what to do. If you're still reading at this point, by some miracle, please advise. At this point my post is devolving and like 90% of the reason I'm writing it is just for therapeutic value, but I need something more, man. I just don't know what to do with myself.

I know a few people who frequent this subreddit. If you know who I am, idk. I suppose you deserve to know as much as anyone. I'm just tired of telling everyone around me that everything is going fine because 99% of the time if I don't it's either my fault or it comes off as whiny (varies based on which person I'm talking to, not the situation I'm talking about). But yeah. Idk. Here I am, most of my family estranged, social interactions are down to two or three friends I speak to on a regular basis, and basically terrified of meeting new folks because of how absolutely embarrassed I feel talking about myself (What do you do? Oh. Well, where did you go to school? Oh. Well, do you have any hobbies? Oh, etc etc). I've been hanging by a thread for years, and I've been here for so long that I just don't know how to pull myself up anymore.

I was very ignorant at first about how financing an adult life, let alone an education works, but I've learned a lot in the past 3 years. My mother has her own debt, yet no degree, so she wanted me to figure it out on my own like how she had to. ***

My 1st go: Went straight out of HS to community college at age 18 as a Linguistics major, death in the family mid-semester, I dropped out due to depression, earned 4 Ws and $2.5k of debt that was sent to collections in 2016.

2nd go: Age 19, I started an out-of-state community college as a Math major. I completed 1 online English class but dropped an online Precalculus class because the textbook and materials were too expensive. It was too late in the semester to add another class. I earned a W in Precalc, a C in English, and because I dropped below 6 credits, I lost my financial aid and earned $2.8k in debt to be paid back immediately and could not enroll the next semester. 

3rd go: Now at age 20, I'm currently enrolled in a different, out-of-state community college as a Computer Science major. I took 4 classes online (2 Computer Science related and 2 Humanities classes) this Fall 2017-Spring 2018 year. Earned 4 Cs and $5500 in Federal Loan debt. 

My 4th go is coming up. I'm about to pay off the $2.5k debt from my 1st go to my local community college pretty soon. I'll be using federal loans to pay for my classes (and at some point in the next year, pay off the $2.8k debt from my 2nd go). 

If I decide to start this Fall, I'll be 21 and still a freshman. Whatever ego I have left is really damaged by this. However, because my friends don't even have to work and take 5 classes a semester while still partying weekly, I have an inferiority complex about not being in college, which is why I keep enrolling. Also, deep down, I just don't want my family to be ashamed of me if I don't get my Bachelor's.

My community college has a transfer agreement with a top ~60 university for any major. So I feel like if I did do the 4 years, I would get a good degree, some version of the ""college experience,"" and the opportunity to study abroad. But what if I can't handle the workload and/or the finances, end up dropping out again, and with even more debt. What if I graduate and can't find a good-paying job and I end up living as a slave to my debt like my mother? I've changed my major every time I started a new school and I honestly don't want to be a CS major anymore (I hate programming). I've taken over 100 career tests and still don't have an idea of what is the right educational plan for me.

Military is not for me,
I'm not the entrepreneurial type either,
Currently working part-time at a daycare and its made me realize I'm not cut out for ""people-facing"" careers.
If I didn't feel like I was so dumb/horrible at school, and it was free, I might consider a PhD because I love doing research. Besides that, my only true skills (literally the only 2 things I'm good at) are learning languages and listening to music. But I wouldn't study language/music because I'm terrified of struggling to get by every payday like my family members.

I don't have another adult in my life I can have deep conversations with anymore, so any advice at all is welcome. 

TL;DR: Horrible track record with (community) college and I'm starting to think college might not be for me. I'm starting to feel like my time is running out but I don't know what other options are good for me (not interested in military, entrepreneurship). What would you say to a 21 year old who isn't yet progressing towards a career?

370,VeraMar,1526068284,/r/college/comments/8iqn6t/how_to_choose_the_college_thats_best_for_you/,"I’d like to provide some brief context as to why I am and why I’m making this post. I’m a college grad (University of Arizona, B.S. in Microbiology), and I’m starting my Masters program soon. My wife and I were recently talking about our college experiences and comparing them to our colleagues/friends who graduated from other states with similar degrees, some of which attained their degrees from highly ranked programs or Ivy League schools. What is the difference between prestigious schools, state schools, and even community colleges? Should we have gotten Ivy League educations instead of our state school educations? I want to share the conclusions of our conversation in hopes that it might help prospective students choose an appropriate school. Based off of our conversation, we thought more expensive or higher ranked schools would potentially have better student resources, more proficient professors, more prestige associated with the attained degree, and stronger likelihood of networking with important people. 

The term “student resources” encompasses so much. It can include anything from counseling services, to types of gyms/recreational area that are available, to the kinds of clubs on campus. Every school wants you to succeed, but having more resources available to you can make it a much easier process. If you find yourself struggling with classes (either emotionally or academically), a school with better on campus health clinics and tutoring services can give you that extra push to do well. Some of you may also be considering professional schools or graduate programs, in which case a strong student services office that can review your applications and professional statements would be incredibly helpful. These are just some examples to name a few. 

If you are not already aware, many universities do research. They want to academic literature to come from their school, but in order to do that they need to bring in individuals to do research and publish said results. These people will often have PhDs (doctorate degrees in a particular area of research), and along with research they also teach students. As such it is not difficult to see how a more wealthy school can bring in professors who may be leading experts in their field. By having them teach the students, they will likely churn out a highly capable student body, and having high scores would reflect well on that school and their corresponding programs. This is great news for students who are interested in getting into research - or even those looking to apply for professional school such as MD/DO - because you will have the chance to work under a professor and help them with their work. 

Then there’s prestige. I haven’t looked this up myself, but I would not doubt there is some correlation between finding a good job and coming from a good school. Whether we like it or not, having the name of a highly ranked school on your resume or CV will definitely raise eyebrows and make you stand out. This can certainly work in your favor of securing a good job after you graduate. 

Lastly, there’s networking. This is really a combination of all the above. As I’ve previously mentioned, having more money available at the school means they’re more capable of hiring very qualified and/or very well-known people for their positions. If you as a student can work under people who have a great reputation in their field, then having them as a reference can give you a significant advantage in the workforce. This applies for just about anyone, whether you’re looking to do research, or if you’re looking to become the next CEO of a big company. Surrounding yourself with people of good reputation can only help you. 

With that being said, going to a prestigious school does not guarantee that you will do well, nor does it mean you will find a great job. Conversely, there have been many successful people that come from “just” state schools. What I recommend is taking a backwards approach to applying to schools or accepting invitations. Start with the career you want to want to aim for, then list the criteria necessary for it. (e.g. if you’re looking to go into an MD program in the future, it would be wise you choose a school where you can do research, is known for their science courses, has good MCAT prep courses, and has good counselors which can help you revise your application). Don’t quite know where you want to end up? That’s fine! Then maybe you should choose a school that is well-rounded and has a good foundation of student counselors that will help guide you. Google is seriously your best friend when doing this sort of research. The more research you do beforehand about what you want/expect out of your education, the easier it’ll be to choose the school that is right for you. Who knows, maybe the school that’s better suited for someone isn’t that very expensive Ivy League school, but rather their local state school! Both my wife and I were incredibly happy about the education we got at the UofA and wouldn’t change it if we had the chance.

He also told me that with my Aerospace major I won't have time to party or do anything much outside of classes, so I shouldn't bother staying near campus.

Not to mention, they will also refuse to do the FAFSA. I've tried numerous times to convince them, but to no avail, they are firm in their stance. My parents kept telling me that they would help pay for my college, but during my senior year of high school, they suddenly throw at me that they won't be doing it anymore. As a senior, this was a major shock to me because they changed their story 180 degrees. My father told me: ""If you want to go to college, you are going to have to pay for everything. We won't help you."" Another thing that is quite annoying is how my parents are also religious fanatics. They're extremely devout Christians who basically became extremely salty towards me all because I decided that I didn't want to do religious classes anymore. For example, just because I decided to stop doing religious classes, my father did not let me drive my own car anymore (for almost a year) as well as f***ing up my checking account (a lotta money that would have paid for 2 year of community college was ""gone""). Luckily now, I opened up a new checking account at PSECU (PA Credit Union) without any chance of my father screwing up my finances. That along with what I mentioned previous have left me incredibly disillusioned as well as hopeless.

So I applied to four local colleges, knowing my situation will require me to commute, not live on campus. I applied to Elizabethtown, Lebanon Valley, Penn State Harrisburg and HACC (Harrisburg Area Community College). I tried explaining everything to the financial aid officers, but of course, since a college education in America has nothing to do with smarts but all about how much money you can wipe your ass with, they didn't do much to help at all. Even telling them that the FAFSA was not going to be completed, they still did nothing to help me. Yes, even the community college is too expensive for me (parents won't cosign any loans).

So, I have a plan; if my parents aren't going to do much to help me pay for college, I guess I'm going to have to pick up the tab right? I plan to take a gap year or two, working a full time job as a bookkeeper as well as a part time job somewhere else (that is assuming I will get the bookkeeping job). I'm going to work to my fullest capacity as well as not spending a single cent from that checking account. Also, I will be retaking the ACT and will be aiming for a really high score (32-36 range). I didn't really know about the possibilities of financial aid through standardized tests until much too late, but better late than never right? My current SAT and ACT scores are 1220 and 27 respectively.

So, is a gap year or two (working a full time job as a bookkeeper and a part time somewhere else, as well as working my butt off to get a 32 or higher on the ACT) a good idea? I really see no other alternative other than the military at this point. But that's probably not an option either because I do have chronic asthma.

So please, after my giant block text of bleh, I was wondering if any of you could please give me some financial advice. I want to go to college and I know what I want to do, but the only thing that is blocking my way is money. Do you think my plan sounds good, or do you have other things in mind? Again, the crux of my plan is assuming I get the bookkeeping job, which pays 28k a year. I really hope to read your responses because as of right now, I am at the crossroads...and am completely and utterly lost. I feel physically and mentally drained from thinking about all of this...its extremely painful to me. I know I'm smart, but colleges don't really give a damn about that; all they care about is my check to them for ten-twenty f'ing grand!

Side-Note:Plus, if I am taking this gap year to garner money and improve my test scores, do you think I'd have a chance at Wharton? My GPA is a 4.0 and I have around 10 AP classes up my belt (some of which include Calculus BC and Physics 1&amp;2). Sometimes I see the high life of people in Ivy Leagues and feel depressed. I see all the smiles, the laughs, the proms, the handsome, clean-shaven and slick-haired white guys with their immaculate Asian girlfriends, and I think to myself: some people really can wipe their ass with their money can't they?

374,RudeRoman,1525150348,/r/college/comments/8g5xio/practically_stuck_committing_to_college_i_hate/,"I’m posting here because I don’t really know what to do and I don’t really know how to cope with the situation (and theres a good chance I’ll delete this later) I am tired and upset so there’s gonna be a lot of rambling. At the time of writing this it is 11:57pm on the night before decision have to be made and I’m practically stuck going to a college I really don’t like. So I went through the college process as normal however I made the mistake of applying to way too many safety’s and way to to many reaches and not enough target schools. Of the safety schools, I forced to apply to UMaine Orono by my mom despite my disliking . Well acceptance letters time came around and unsurprisingly I get waitlisted/ rejected from all the reaches, got into my safety’s , and got into the couple targets applied to. I narrowed down my list to about three colleges, Wentworth, Florida Tech, and UMaine, (two targets, one safety, didn’t consider anymore safety’s because they were expensive and not good schools) Umaine ended up in that group because it was so cheap and as backup. Eventually i visited Wentworth, and I’m a small school/city type person so of course I liked it a lot as well as I enjoyed the program, I’m also from Boston so being in the middle of the city was a big +. When I went to visit UMaine, I absolutely hated it. The campus felt so isolated being all the way up north, I didn’t really enjoy the type of people who go there (mostly but not all party kids, I don’t really mix in with that crowd) and I was less than impressed with their engineering program (I would be going for mechanical, and that’s the branch that had the worst facilities as well as of the only engineerings that weren’t guaranteed Co-op/rarely got it)(also most of their job placement is in northern Maine, and I don’t think I would be able to mentally handle living up there for more than a week). I eventually had to rule out Florida tech as I did not have time to visit/too expensive to fly down. Fast forward a little bit later when Financial aid packets start to role in. Wentworth is almost twice as expensive as Maine and they gave me little no aid. I tried appealing for more aid but they gave only $2000. This made the Wentworth net cost $39,000, making it almost half of my parents income and 11,000 more that Maine (which is 28,000 a year). On top of that with my brother currently in college, we would have to $5000 a month, which is insane. So in the end, I am stuck with these two options: Go to an overpriced college that I enjoy(but can barely afford), or a cheap college that I hate. Wentworth pros: nice facilities, good campus, strong co-op, a college I like Cons: overpriced for what you get, hard to transfer if I didn’t like it. Maine Pros: cheap, easier to transfer cons: the campus, the people, the program. My biggest issue was although i liked Wentworth a lot, money just can’t be ignored as well as I don’t know if it’s worth the money (it’s a good school, not a great school). However my other biggest issue was I honestly really don’t like Maine as well as there’s no guarantee I’d be able to transfer and if I couldn’t I’d be stuck. After talking it out with my friend and siblings, although it’s a really tough one for me, I think I’m going to have to put my deposit down for Maine because I really don’t want to be a financial burden on my family and I’d feel really guilty if I put down for wentworth (although my parents keep telling me it’s still an option). It just seems like the most logical course of action even though it doesn’t really help me personally and any way. I know at the end of the day it’s just college and it sounds like I’m being dramatic. but it’s really taking a toll on me emotionally for some reason. I can’t help but start crying whenever I think about my fait (and Im not normally the emotional type). Anyone experience anything similar? Is my decision the right one? Any coping advice for now/the future? 

TL;DR-I was forced to apply a college that I wasn’t interested in (Umaine). Got in, visited it, hated it. Fast forward and I’m stuck between deciding to go to an Overpriced college I like a lot but would barely be able to afford (wentworth) or going to a cheap college that I honestly really dislike (Umaine). Because I didn’t want to be a severe financial burden, I am choosing Umaine, but it’s really taking a toll on me mentally/emotionally for some reason and I don’t know how to cope with it. 

Anyone experience anything similar? Is my decision the right one? Any coping advice for now/the future?

376,bozongle,1523249591,/r/college/comments/8avydk/im_failing_all_my_classes_and_only_recently/,"This is sort of a cry for help because I have no idea how to resolve anything I've done to myself over the past few months in such a short period of time, and my future is looking to be full of despair.

For background, I'm a first-generation Indian-American student with strict Indian parents who were academic studs and went from being nothing to achieving great success in the US. 

As a result, I was brought up to be academic-oriented and they constantly reinforced me to get good grades, do well in school, join academic clubs, etc. And it worked, for the most part. High school was structured in a way where low effort yet high talent led me to succeed. I would procrastinate every assignment yet complete them just in time to get a high grade, I was an amazing test-taker and studying for an hour or two the night before a big exam could get me an A. My constant success academically in high school overshadowed the fact I had no hobbies, no interest in anything other than to be social (I'm a very sociable person and getting rejected socially throughout high school is one of the prominent reasons of my depression/anxiety) and basically did the minimum to keep up my standard of being a smart Indian kid while also partying and trying to make friends (I won't get into detail about this, but my struggle with this damaged me beyond repair). 

At the end of it all, I graduated with a 4.43 GPA, a 35 on my ACT (which was enforced by constant tutoring by a very expensive tutor which my parents probably didn't have the money to be spending on), and a myriad of school club accomplishments. Yet, I procastinated my college and scholarship essays to the point where I didn't get into any of the twelve colleges I applied nor got any scholarships except for my safety state university (they gave me a $40,000 scholarship based on my GPA) which I am studying at now.

I was (and still am) a foolish kid, and college independence was huge. No longer was I constantly harassed by my parents about academics, I was finally allowed to go out on my own whim and take contorl of my life. At first, college was a breath of fresh air, but then everything came crashing down once responsibilities overwhelmed me. Essays, exams, homework, scholarships (my parents, although middle-class, have a lot of commitments financially and thus need any financial support I can get), socializing with people, friendships, past memories of hardship, all sorts of different stresses and pressures overwhelmed me. So I did what I do best: avoid it all. I started skipping class and procrastinating HW assignments, overconfident that I was able to do it in high school all the time. After I did it a little, I got away with making up/bullshitting assignments at first. But, college is nothing like HS. High school had structure, and was enforced discipline - even if I procrastinated HW, I still was forced to sit in classes and pay attention for 8 hours a day. My life had no such discipline or structure, and as such I let everything go to shit. I started partying more and more because I had few such opportunities in high school but then found myself not enjoying any of it because of my constant anxiety about others' thoughts of me and my actions. I started withdrawing from others and just overall my life once I hit a snowball effect of just skipping class, trying to party and be accepted by various friend groups, and just having no motivation or energy to do anything at all - I literally tried to just find instant gratification in anyway possible. This led to me skipping class every week and I turned into a stoner. I convinced myself I was a lazy bastard from all the drugs and partying and after an Adderall binge before finals week, I recovered my grades just enough above the 3.0 GPA requirement for my scholarship; I got a 3.16.

Going to a safety school, my parents expected a 3.9/4.0. I felt like a complete failure and decided I would recover it next semester, and take up healthy and positive habits in order to make sure I did. By committing to this, I felt that telling my parents at the end of the year I got a 3.6/3.7 balanced out would be better than telling them the truth. So what did I do? Faked my transcript, and told them I got a 4.0, and they weren't even surprised they literally told me it was ""expected.""

Then, winter break came, and this was a very depressive period for me. I got rejected again by the people I thought were my friends (didn't invite me to any parties, didn't respond to my messages) and literally spent 21 straight days doing nothing but sleeping and playing Fortnite. I didn't even enjoy fortnite; I did it to pass the time.


This trend continued into the next semester, I took easier classes so I thought things would go easy, and I got caught up in my overconfident avoidance mindset. Long story short, I fell into a web of drug use, lying, avoiding responsibility, and trying to figure things out on my own before I finally hit the lowest point - I spent 3 weeks in a row skipping class, sleeping in until 4 PM, didn't enjoy or want to do anything, not play video games, not do drugs, or party, just stay in bed and do nothing, and finally went 48 hours straight without eating anything - because I had no energy or motivation to even get up and walk 2 minutes to the dining hall and eat. I decided it was enough, went to CAPS (Counseling and Psycholigical Services) and after breaking down and crying to my psychologist for 40 minutes about my problems and my life, he very easily diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and also possible ADD.

This diagnosis was less than a month ago, and everything makes sense to me now. I've had depression for years but was able to cope because of the structure of my life in high school, but once that structure was gone, everything fell apart and I didn't realize that I needed help. I didn't think it was depression no matter how much I researched the issue - I want to be a psychiatrist and had helped my best friend, the one person besides my girlfriend who is closest to me, through his depression, even to the point where he was about to commit suicide and I was the one to talk him out of it. I always consider my self a lazy piece of shit, and I think I am truly - that depression is another excuse.

But, when I'm talking to my therapist, it all feels to real and his points hit me hard and genuinely I need therapy to improve. I got a job and started making progress in being productive, and felt so good about working a 65 hour work week last week and working another 38 hours this week. I work close every night, get a good 7 hours of sleep, and still have been struggling to go to class but I've been doing better. Small steps have helped me lift myself out of this depression, but the damage of my ignorant self has been done. a 3.16 GPA first semester, and now - Ds/Fs in 3 of my classes and a C- in one class with only a month of my semester left (with a bunch of missing assignments, attendance/participation points lost, exams coming up that I have no idea how to study for because they cover months of material). I feel like I have trapped myself - my parents will freak the moment they find out about my grades, let alone the depression, or loss of scholarship. I love this university and don't want to leave and do NOT want to go to community college/local college - please don't suggest this I've already considered this. I don't technically have a medical diagnosis, as the soonest psychiatric consultation in my collegetown is in the summer, and of course I'm under my parents' insurance so they would notice the bill. Everything's crashing down on me and I genuinely feel there is nothing but despair in my life coming for me - my therapist told me to reach out to an advisor/professors about my options but having no medical diagnosis, being so late in the semester, and still struggling to balance everything in my life and still having a habit of procrastination has made everything so much harder, let alone the thought of my awful grades, or losing my scholarship, or my parents going bezerk and withdrawing me and sending me to some Indian school. It sucks, because just as I finally started to understand what I needed to get out of this horrible phase of my life, the consequences of my past actions are keeping me in it.


I just don't know what to do. I just want to be able to get past this semester, improve myself over the summer, and come back better prepared mentally next semester with a scholarship and perform up to the academic standards I used to set myself to. But with no interests or passions, and pursuing a pre-med career simply because of my parents' desires (although the desire for psychology is true and valid), and my terrible academic record and loss of scholarship, I feel like I fucked myself over really hard. And this is an expression of all of that. I need help, I'm sorry if this was too long to read - I just thought details would help to understand my situation. **tl;dr:** after fucking around and trying to avoid my problems for my freshman year, I hit my lowest point and have been (nonmedically) diagnosed with depression/anxiety that was the root cause - but the damage is done and I will lose my scholarship (minimum 3.0 gpa) and end up with a sub 2.5 gpa this year, and my future is pretty bleak. I'm not suicidal but it's hard to get those thoughts with such a future in sight.

I was also accepted into Syracuse University, but that's even MORE expensive and I'm skeptical as to whether they give me any fin aid or not. 

However, I was admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a lot of financial aid and scholarship money, but upon visiting the school my parents don't want me going there as they think it's too ""broken down"" and ""worn out"" for me.

380,man_of_doom,1522341799,/r/college/comments/882sq5/tldr_should_i_drop_this_class/,"So this might be a bit of a read, but here goes. 

I’m in my senior year and I’m hoping to graduate this fall, but I’ve run into a bit of a problem. I’m taking 15 credits this semester instead of 12, and I need 18 more to graduate. 
Additionally, I’ve expressed interest in joining an accelerated program that would allow me to earn my master’s degree in five years instead of six. It has additional benefits like not having to take the GRE, the classes themselves not being as expensive, being provided with a grant to pay off tuition for said classes, etc. 

On the other hand, I’ve been having some major burnout issues since the last summer semester I took, which isn’t helped by the fact that the previous semester before, I actually made the president’s list, and I feel there’s nowhere else to go but down. Said burnout was mitigated by some of the classes (particularly the ones relevant to my major), which I absolutely loved taking. Not the case with this semester, in which the major-related classes are outnumbered by required upper division courses.  

As of this semester, I’ve run into a major roadblock. Namely, one of my classes just really sucks shit right now, and the professor isn’t helping. He’s one of those comedian types, and while a good joke is nice every now and then, it just gets to the point where I’ve ended up learning diddly squat. The first exam I took, I ended up with a C (which isn’t too bad, considering how I’ve been trying to keep up with homework and quizzes, and getting top marks on those). But that exam wasn’t remotely proctored, and I literally have another exam with this class tomorrow, which IS remotely proctored. I don’t think I’ve been this unprepared for an exam in a long time. 

It doesn’t help that one of my classmates from last semester took the same professor I’m taking, and her experiences were just purely negative. She failed the first exam, and promptly just dropped the class. She retook it, but with a different professor who was much better. The class in question is a principles of finance class. 

Under any other circumstances, I would have dropped this class in a heartbeat, but I’ve run into a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation. Pretty much everything is just riding on my graduating this fall, and it’s looking increasingly unlikely. But at the same time, I really don’t want to fail another class. My parents and some friends have been putting an exorbitant amount on me graduating as soon as possible, and so have my advisors. 
Case in point, the husband of a high school teacher who helped me run my autism awareness club at that high school is going to be retiring this fall (he actually works at my campus), and he wanted to put something special together before he retired. 

Plus, the professor my friend took is on a different campus, much farther away from where I live. I’ve been looking into other options about retaking it, and I know just one W isn’t really going to hurt my chances, plus I’d still be a full-time student even if I did drop this course. 
On the other hand, I need to have completed this finance class in order to take ANOTHER class in order to graduate. If I end up dropping this course, I’ll be way off schedule to graduate. 

I’m going to talk to the counseling services, and I’m going to talk with the advisor that’s in charge of the accelerated program. 


So TL:DR; Should I drop this class?

Which means most of my ""friends"" from high school are back a in-state schools. I ha a rough time socially in high school due to health and because of my health, I didn't smoke or drink, and I think my friends though I would snitch on them if I as around them doing that, so I lost pretty much most of my friends my junior year. Didn't go to parties, everytime I tried to hang out, I get rejected, and all the party kids were my teammates on the baseball team. I also barely played any baseball, the thing I love as much as my family, because of my coach though I hate become weak after I was sick, and didn't think I could play anymore. Long story short, high school sucked. So I was kind of glad I went to an out of state school so I could no longer be around that cancer, started a new life. I was really excited to rush and join a fraternity to be part of the party life, make new friends, and compensate for what I missed out on in high school. At the same time, I was experiment with adding and dropping classes, and dropped a class for my major, Chemistry 1, on accident and couldn't find a time or days I could take it that semester, so I was already behind in my schedule before I even started college. I also didn't get into the fraternity I wanted a dropped, which I regret not being more open minded and just choosing one. To add insult to injury, my roommate facetimed his girlfriend every night, and went home weekends we didn't have home football games. I thought college was, or specifically my college, was going to be easy because its a school in the South, so you know, not much intelligence. I was wrong, and ended up with a 2.6 GPA. I was devastated, and sort of got a wake up call. The only good thing about that semester was my joining a club and finding a community through them. The next semester wasn't any better. My friend wanted me to rush so I could be in his fraternity, and didn't get a bid from them or any other frat, so another semester of no partying, making friends, or girls. I was jealous of all the guys having fun of the frats having fun an I couldn't have that kind of fun as well. Also no fun Spring Break plans. My GPA was a little better, only because I only had two classes to my degree plan, which I ended up having to dropping a class again, Calculus 1, meaning I was now a semester and a half behind in my second semester of college. I just had a bunch of electives to boost my GPA. By May, I was so glad to move out, but I couldn't transfer to my dream school, The University of Texas at Austin, because my GPA was too low. My summer was ok. I tried to take summer classes but that ended up not working out, so I couldn't catch up and that bummed me out so much because I couldn't imagine any of my friends already being behind by the end of their freshman year of college. I moved into an apartment this year, and even though I have friends, I didn't really consider too many of them as close enough friends to be roommates with, and those that I wanted to be my friends already had arrangements. So I had to roommate match, which they've, until recently, have been better than last year's roomate. Rushed again, assuming I was going to be in my friend's frat, because he said I would be a shoe-in, and not only did I not get a bid from them, but none of the other frats here. So another semester of no fun, no friends, and no girls, whereas freshman are getting into frat with no problems because they know people and get to live the life I wanted all 4 years of college. I, at most could, only be in a frat for 2 1/2 years, (probably going to be a 5, maybe 6 year student so maybe 3 or 4 years after all). Classes this semester were fine, but I tripped up on some tests and ended up with a 2.8 GPA by Christmas. The club I was part of started to drive me crazy, but at some point that half the classes I scheduled for this semester go toward a minor in Business Administration, so I thought that was cool, and am now pursuing that. I also realized that it would be easier for me to get an MBA at my from school that a Master in ME from Texas. So now, here I am, having signed a bid to a frat but not being able to do anything  or meet any of my brother's or pledge brothers because of the school's President cancelling then deciding to do Spring Rush, but not having decided when, and because it's halfway through the semester, I'm assuming they won't do it, so 2 years wasting my college time not being in a frat and having a small social life and group of good friends. I did make it a resolution to be more outgoing, which did work, but not to the amount that I wanted, and I haven't really studied or hungout with these people, just good friends in my class. So here we are today, after dropping another class that I need, Physics 1, after I, and everyone else bombed the test Monday, and just signed a lease at another complex without any friends to be my roommates, so doing roommate matching agin, only praying that my future roommates are close to my preference, let alone guys in my fraternity, so I already regret signing it, and not staying at my current complex  in another room or another complex because their closer closer, and a number of other reasons. I'm also upset that I keep dropping classes and wasting my parents money, as well as not progressing a my degree plan and getting closer to graduating. I'm upset that I don't or haven't had any of my friends become my roommates, I'm a pessimist and depressed because I always think that nothing will work-out for me since nothing has since my junior year of high school. I know that I'm depressed, everyone does, but I refuse to see a therapist because I know that I'm too stubborn and pessimistic to listen to their advice because I don't possible see how it'll improve my life. I don't go out to the bars on the weekends because I don't really have friends to go with. I tried going by myself a few times because of my resolution, and it's intimidating going by yourself, especially if you don't have a fake, because, for me, it's easier to talk to people, especially girls when I'm buzzed. Also bars quickly get expensive, are loud, and without being in a frat, I can't drink, so I stay in on the weekends, which upsets my parents. They want me to be more social. I know my priorities are out of whack, and I wish I could change that, but the party scene is so big at my school, that it's hard to not think about it. I could motivate myself with the money from my future career, which ironically, I know what to do, Reservoir Engineer, but it hasn't. I also want to get into McCombs School of Business at Texas to ge my MBA so it makes it easier to go up my future company's chain of command, which is hopefully Shell, ExxonMobil, or other big name oil companies, but for those companies I need at least a 3.2 GPA, and to get into McCombs, a 3.4. I'm also afraid about life after graduating because it seems so monogamous, waking up, go to work, go home, eat, sleep. I've heard that the social party life gets better after college because now you have money to do what I want, but I find that hard to believe because I'm no longer around college girls, and there aren't frat parties to go to anymore, only bars, an even that, to me, starts to look monogamous. That my pessimism showing again. I've heard to slowly become an optimist, I should write down at least 3 good things that happened everyday, but I can't even think of three things.I just want to hear what yall have to say, but typically when I post stuff, I get negative comment from people which is extremely unhelpful, so just advice or, hopeful stories that hopefully I'm not the only one facing these struggles.

Edit:Most of my friends are in Greek Life, and seeing everything that they're doing on Snapchat and Instagram makes me feel bad because I know that also should be me, but it isn't me, and it gets me really sad that I'm not spending my time in college like that. Another thing I worry/get upset about is that freshman, who are taking Calculus 2, Chemistry 2, and Physics 1, are making these classes look easy, or aren't struggling nearly as hard as I am in classes that I'm currently in, and it urks me how they get it and get better grades, and I don't. Another thing is for most engineering students, it takes 5 years on average to graduate, but I feel like it'll take me 5 1/2-6 years to graduate, whereas my other friends, college or high school friends, even those who are also engineering majors, will have already graduated and have a job, while I'll still be in school, making me feel like an idiot compared to them. Now I've heard you shouldn't worry about what others are doing or thinking about you, only worry about you and yourself, but for me, its a lot easier said than done because I want to impress and outdo other

382,MrKayMkay,1520931271,/r/college/comments/842owm/cultural_differences_between_attending_college_in/,"Hi r/college, I currently attend university in NSW, Australia and I think it would be interesting to note cultural differences between our tiertary education experience, although I must admit most of my knowledge of American colleges are based on american tv shows so that side will be extremely biased and one sided so please feel free to correct me!

Australia

- An extreme majority choose to live at their parent's home while attending university, and many continue to do so after graduating; there is no social stigma of continuing to live at home.

- Most commute to university in fairly long hours whereby the commute can take 2 hours to and back; this is widely considered a social norm and there is little complaining about it (although I have heard the perspectives of many international students being shocked by it)

- Few choose to live on campus due to it being extremely expensive; the American ""college experience"" is largely foregone and not really a part of reality.

- High school friends are extremely important as a very large majority choose to attend university in their state in a nearby city; it is not uncommon for many people to stick with old high school friends for life due to the nature of commuting taking up most time to make close friends on campus. High school friends will also most likely form the basis of networking in university, as many new people you meet will likely have mutual friends.

- The vast majority choose to work a part time job in order to pay for the high living costs of social leisure time; it is an expected norm to balance long commute hours, work hours, studying and social life.

- Many choose to ""skip"" lectures simply due to feeling it is not worth it as most are recorded online and thus the long commute hours as well as the opportunity of increased working hours, sleeping hours or social leisure time.

- Post graduation, students are not hit by crippling student debt as we are covered by a government subsidised interest free student loan, whereby it is paid back in increments only once the student passes a certain income threshold.

America

- The majority choose to leave home and live on college dorms on campus; there is a social stigma of continuing to live with your parents.

- Most do not commute to uni due to living on campus; most international students whom I have talked to are shocked by the long commute hours locals regularly experience.

- Many chose to live on campus simply because it is an expected norm; the ""college experience"" is very well a reality.

- High school friends quickly become irrelevant as students move to another university in another state and make new friends; these friends will likely become your close friends for life due simply to living in close proximity to them.

- Most choose to not work, instead opting to use the saved time to study and experience a vibrant social life. (I am not too sure of this and I am probably wrong)

- Some do skip lectures, but it is not encouraged to because your classes are relatively nearby your place of residence and it takes minimal effort to wake up on time and attend.

- Post graduation, students are hit by student crippling debt due to the costs of living on campus and the cost of a degree that may or may not be useful in the long term, leaving many to use it as a valid reason forgo going to college.

I'm on a transfer program, so I have assured entry into a California State University when I'm done here with my AA at the end of this coming Fall.

However, within a few months of transferring, my GI Bill will be exhausted, meaning that I will have no way to continue my education. Currently, they pay my tuition, books, and give me a monthly stipend just enough to afford to rent a room and for food.

Here are a few things you should know:

1) I'm a fully independent adult with no family or friends to rely on (family is dead. Friends all live elsewhere.)
2) In order to afford on-campus housing (off-campus is more expensive), food, books, and my car insurance when I transfer, I will need to somehow make a minimum of $23,000 per year AFTER taxes are withheld. Broken down by weekly rates, at $10.50 after taxes (minimum wage), I will need to work 53 hours per week to simply afford the aforementioned. This DOES NOT include tuition.

Question: How the hell do independent adults afford to go to school full-time and make enough to pay for rent and food and the basic necessities? 

I'm not worried about getting my tuition paid for because I'm a 4.0 student and a military veteran and feel that scholarships won't be too much of a problem to get. But as far as affording to simply live, I don't have the slightest clue how I'm going to be able to make that happen.

I think most college students don't have this problem. Even most other veterans I know using their GI bill live with their parents and don't have to really pay too much for their own expenses. But for someone who is fully self-reliant, how do I make it work?

384,NewContemporary,1517324899,/r/college/comments/7u1m93/mental_health_or_intership/,"Hello Reddit,

  I am a junior in college . I am an anthropology major and so far have had two paid internships in the field. The first was close to my house and I made my schedule in a certain way where it wasn't an issue and I was only allowed 10/15 hours a week. 
.
Now, I have this other internship in the city closer to my campus and have had it for about a year now. It's a job researching and writing and I'm an assistant to my boss who gives me these assignments where I'm unfamiliar with the subject matter and I have to research and after that, write. I can do it it's just now I have taken my class load down from five classes to three this semester to balance everything more. Also last semester when I was taking five classes I barely made it by and simply just strived to pass my classes. However my mental health was out of whack and I was constantly depressed and then would have anxiety and used heavy drinking on the weekends to cope with everything . ...
.
This semester I'm trying to be nicer to myself and not push myself to the edge of giving up on school altogether as I have already come this far. So like I said , I am taking three classes. 
. 
However , these classes are now heavily discussion based and require me to actually do the reading to get points in the class. And the readings are pretty heavy and not always digestible . Not to mention, I actually want to understand what the fuck I am learning in class and remember it to a certain extent. I think honestly my profs were nice to me and passed me to a certain extent because I kept in communication with them about everything but last semester a ton of my assignments were late or I was given an extension. 
.
I don't drive right now as school is plenty expensive on its own without a car And I only get loans . So I take the bus and I have to be there with the way my schedule is this semester at 6 am to get there by seven then take the bus from work at 11 to get to school by 12. However, I have no classes on Fridays so I can actually work a full shift, as I do on breaks then. 
.
I'm seriously losing my shit right now cause although that works in theory in real life that's too much because of just having time to work out / sleep/ eat/ read / do homework takes a bit of time. I'm trying to take better care of myself this semester and the semester has just started and I'm already feeling myself get into this space that I really don't like. .
.
I just emailed my boss and asked if I can work remotely at school at my breaks between classes , and after school, then come into the office on Fridays to present my work and also to work one full shift then . This is really feasible because there's no real reason for me to have to be at work other than her seeing my physical body working. But with writing you have to be in a good headspace to write and when I have to commute in the early morning and fill like shit from reading and sleep deprived I can't wrote as is so my productivity is low. 
.
I work best around the afternoon when the gears have already been turning for a bit . And I am in a space where I can write....... Being in an office where people are gossiping and things or answering calls, etc. Is a hard environment for me to work in. 
.
If my boss doesn't take my proposal I'm not sure what to do . I like the job and it's a good job I'm not willing to just like lose my shit though to keep it. I live at home still and my parents support me for the greater extent of my needs except for when I have the money to help out ( books/ I buy my own food/ buss pass/ phone bill/ help with groceries for them / pay people I carpool with, etc) oorrr last semester I spent a lot of money on alcohol but now as I have been working out more and using that and yoga as an outlet and also lightening my load of classes ; I have lessened the drinking and now hardly do it at all unless it's a social thing and I find myself there . ( It's hard to get in shape when you drink) .

So  I figured I'd post it here as well in case there are people interested in this.

**Introduction**

College is a big decision for people.  To narrow down a school based on career prospects and location is a daunting task, and it isn't made any easier if you consider other factors as well.  I can't really offer you any insight on how to decide which school has the best food, but I can help you look at equestrian opportunities of various schools.  These ultimately boil down to 3 separate types: school run equestrian programs, student run programs, and private barns.  They all have their pros and cons which I've listed below.





**School Run Equestrian Programs**

These programs are run by the college or university at facilities that are often owned by the college/university.  Competitive riding teams are often coached by college faculty.  Many of these schools have much smaller student communities that may only number in the hundreds to a few thousands

*Pros*

* Equestrian centers are a part of campus, thus there is usually easy transportation or access by the students to them.

* Many schools will use their equestrian centers as classrooms and provide majors related to the equine industry.

* Many schools and programs have easy access to the equine industry through personal networks of the faculty.  Can make finding an equine job very easy.

* Some schools have a very good reputation for their equine programs and can make getting an internship or job much easier.

* Horse show competitions can be held on campus, definitely beats getting up at 4AM for a 3 hour drive to another school (You'll probably still have to get up at 4AM to care for the horses though).

*Cons*

* Can be quite competitive. If you aren't riding that frequently, you might not make it onto the competition teams.  Some of the riders who are applying for these schools ride daily and compete regularly within organizations like USEF and AQHA. If you do make it to the team, then showing is usually mandatory.

* Many schools running their own equine programs will not have nearly as much variety in choice of majors for other fields.  Also, the programs they do have may not be as highly ranked.

* Can be rather expensive.  An equestrian center with a couple dozen horses usually isn't cheap.

**Student Run Organizations**


These kind of programs are run by the students, for the students with support from the college/university.  They will often hire a nearby horse trainer/barn owner to be the coach for the team.  Different colleges offer differing amounts of support to the team and some schools cover all travel expenses for collegiate competitions.

*Pros*

* Excellent leadership opportunities if you're interested. Lead the team as captain, or manage the finances.  Be in charge of membership or team events.  Any of these positions give valuable experience for any career.

* Can be very economical, depending on school support.  It will almost always be cheaper than riding at a school run program.

* Can be found almost anywhere in the country.  Schools you might not associate with horses very likely do have a team.

* Will usually be much more laid back and open to anyone.  Usually more beginner friendly than other programs, competitions are usually optional, and will usually have a larger variety of rider backgrounds.

* Larger schools will often have very good programs and a wide variety of majors to choose from (Engineering might not have a lot to do with horses but at least you'll have the money for a horse! Time is another issue entirely)

*Cons*

* Programs are often unknown.  You may have to look for the program.  (Ohio State has an equestrian team?!?! Yes. Yes they do.)

* The teams will usually not attract the best riding talent from high school, though it would be unwise to dismiss them for it.

* Many of these teams need to fundraise or participate in community service.


**Private Barns**

If the school doesn't have a student equestrian team or an equestrian program of their own, odds are there is a local private barn with riding lessons available to you.  These are going to be local trainers or horse owners that are horse crazy and proud of it!

*Pros*

* You can find one just about anywhere in the continental USA, Canada, and even Alaska! I can't speak for Hawaii but they probably exist there too.

* Usually very flexible with lessons. Only constraint is YOUR schedule.

* Small barn families make for great stories and adventures.  The dorm won't be your home, the barn is!

* Working student positions are more likely to exist

* There is rarely only just one barn nearby, enabling you to compare lesson prices if you wish.

*Cons*

* Very limited, if any, competition opportunities.

* Getting rides to and from the barn without a car can prove challenging

* Local barn owners may not have enough experience to teach beyond a certain level


Though these are 3 basic categories, every program is different and there will be advantages and disadvantages that might not be listed above.  I encourage you to look at each program individually.  Next, I'm going to discuss competition organizations.





**Collegiate Competitions**

At the collegiate level, there are multiple organizations that oversee the competitive riding teams across the country.  Some are specific to schools, while others cater to a specific discipline.  Some of the main programs in the United States are the NCEA (National Collegiate Equestrian Association), the IHSA (Intercollegiate Horse Show Association), IDA (Intercollegiate Dressage Association), and the American National Riding Commission (ANRC).


*NCEA*

A part of the NCAA, this organization oversees women's equestrian teams across 23 United States schools.  This is the only one of the 4 that is exclusively for women.  The NCEA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining (in other words, both hunt seat and western riding).  For more information, check out their website at http://www.collegiateequestrian.com/


*IHSA*

Founded by Bob Cacchione (I have a mug signed by him) in 1967, this organization has grown to serve almost 400 schools across the continental United States and Canada.  The organization has approximately 8400 riders participating in horse shows all across the country.  The IHSA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining.  The main difference between the IHSA and NCEA, besides member schools, is the IHSA does not have any gender restrictions.  Also, while they both offer the same assortmant of riding diciplines, the scoring system between them are different.  The IHSA offers competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.ihsainc.com/        For a listing of current teams, check out https://members.ihsainc.com/publicteaminfo/currentteams.aspx


*IDA*

Founded as an informal competition between northeastern United States schools in 1995, the IDA now has more than 50+ member schools across the country.  The organization provides competitions for Dressage, possibly the most ""artsy"" form of riding (I don’t mean this in a dismissive way, I have the greatest respect to those who make dressage look easy).  They offer competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.teamdressage.com/home


*ANRC*

Founded in 2006 and an affiliate of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) and the United States Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA), the ANRC has served 80 schools through the ANRC Intercollegiate Equitation Championship.  Riders may compete in one of two levels: a National level at 3’ and a Novice level at 2’6”.  Teams and riders are judged in their performance through 4 phases of competition.  For more information, check out their website at http://anrc.org/





**Conclusion and Author's Note**

There is a lot of information out there for prospective collegiate riders, and trust me when I say that you don't have to give up your riding just to go to school.  So many opportunities exist for almost every interest, and I can practically guarantee that you will find a school and a riding program that is right for you.  Some schools even have multiple teams, which can give you the opportunity to compete in multiple collegiate organizations.  

My own experience with collegiate riding has been through a student run organization (Semi Varsity Club Sport) and I have primarily competed within the IHSA.  My knowledge of the other competitions are limited to what I could gather from their own websites and Google so I encourage you to do your own research into those organizations or contact them and ask directly.  If you have questions specific to the IHSA or student run equestrian teams, my own experience can probably answer your question or at least point you in the right direction.  

Lastly, many teams (student run and school run) have websites with information about their team.  Some of these teams offer programs like a ""Test Ride"" where high school students can get a tour of campus and of equestrian facilities, a lesson or introduction with the team coach, and a day as a ""member"" of the team.  Take advantage of these and see what a day in the life of a collegiate equestrian is like.  For the IHSA specifically, their member list that I provided has links to many of these websites.  Take a look at what is out there, you'll find something.

Was lazy in high school, went to community college, after switching my major around 3-4 times and amassing 45 credits along with a 3.0 GPA and a whole bunch of withdrawals I have decided to skip out all together on an Associate's degree and now want to transfer to a university and live in a dorm.

I've generally been able to receieve mostly A's and B's at community college along with a C+ and a few C's. However this semester has been a mess and I took on 5 classes and withdrew all but one. I feel somewhat like a failure because I was having difficulty and was failing my Accounting and Biology course.

My original intention was to get my Associates in Business but I now realize this major is too dificult to me and not of much interest. I now want to major in my true passion, Politics. However I don't want to waste time switching majors again and then transfer, I would rather just transfer and start fresh and get it over with.

My problem is; I have not been in a true college environment and I don't know how I will be able to handle it once I tranfer. I have heard stories from my friends who tell me their friends that transferred had a lot of problems and even one dropped out his first semester because the coursework felt that difficult. This puts fear in me because university is expensive and I don't want to fail and half ass.

So far I have spent less than $50 TOTAL per semester on books, instead relying on other ways to keep it cheap, including sharing textbooks.  This is the first semester where it's been impossible to keep costs down and I can only imagine how frustrating it is in certain disciplines that typically have expensive books.  

Finally, last semester my school switched to a new store *in the middle of the semester* and so all of us have to figure out how to navigate this new store over a very short break-- I have no problem buying from the school store when that option is actually the cheapest.

391,jkhso,1514419531,/r/college/comments/7miwi1/10_things_i_learned_during_my_first_semester_of/,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a good break! I just finished my first semester of college and wanted to share few things I personally learned. Hopefully this can help current and future students!

&amp;nbsp;

**1. College is damn expensive**
&amp;nbsp;
College is expensive, and I think everyone knows that. Regardless of whether your parent are paying for them or you're getting a loan, do not waste money by not giving 110% effort. You are there to to learn and succeed, not to go out every night and fail classes. I'm not saying you can't have fun, but make sure you set your priorities straight before it's too late. If you're getting a loan, I think you should sacrifice more 

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Talk to your parents often**
&amp;nbsp;
We are probably all enjoying this newly found freedom in college without our parents being on our ass 24/7. Although this might be nice, you will most likely never see them as often as you did in high school. Always make sure to let them know you love them because soon they might not be here anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Hard work will beat intelligence** 
&amp;nbsp;
Some people are naturally smarter, and it really does suck. But don't let this be an excuse to lowering your expectations. I have met so many people who aren't naturally smart but has worked extremely hard to get A's.  Also, if you're smart don't rub it in. It's pretty douchey. 

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Find what studying style works for you**
&amp;nbsp;
Just because your friends study a certain way doesn't mean it will work for you. I wasted the first month of my college frantically taking notes and realized that I'm just spitting the what my professor said onto a paper rather than trying to understand it. And most of them time, the professor will post lecture notes online. Finding what worked for me helped me save a lot of time.

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Don't skip class**
&amp;nbsp;
Like I said, college is expensive. It might not feel like it, but you're wasting so much money every time you're skipping class. Even if you don't think it's helpful, go. Form new relationships and get to know the teacher. Who knows, you might end up needing to ask for letter of recs from the teacher of the class you always skipped. 

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Get out of your room**
&amp;nbsp;
Do not stay in your room all day. There are so many people in college, there is someone who you can connect with. Make some friends. Find a date. Do something other than being in your room all day. It's not healthy and you will regret it. 

&amp;nbsp;

**7. Find some sort of activity that will keep you or get you into shape**
&amp;nbsp;
Exercising is not only good for looking good but it will help you get better grades and stay healthy. Don't let yourself get out of shape because it's hard to get back in. Plus it's not attractive :P. Stay fit. It's good for you.

&amp;nbsp;

**8. Partying/drinking is not ""cool""**
&amp;nbsp;
As everyone probably know, partying and drinking is huge in college. I'm not against them, and I personally think they can be fun. But I do have a problem with how they are praised to be ""cool"". Like some kids think it's ""cool"" to get plastered and black out and puke. They brag to their friends next morning about how ""hard"" they went and people praise them. Honestly, this is not the case. Remember if you're only doing things to look ""cool"", chances are, you're probably not cool lol. Also, everything in moderation. 

&amp;nbsp;

**9. Keep your integrity and don't lose yourself** 
&amp;nbsp;
You will probably change drastically throughout college. I know I did. But make sure you don't lose sight of who you are. Sure you might find new hobbies and interests, but don't be someone who you're not. Don't cheat on homework or test because you didn't study. Don't be an asshole because you think it will make you look cooler. Don't fall under peer pressure. Always make sure you put school on top of the priority list. Just be responsible.  

&amp;nbsp;

**10. Have fun! Socialize! Gain new perspective and learn about new cultures!** 
&amp;nbsp;
These are 4 years of life you will never experience again. If you regret doing or not doing something in high school do it! If you like a guy or a girl, ask her out! Don't be a Pu**y! If you want to be more outgoing, be more outgoing because you are starting fresh. So is everyone else! If you think it's weird to talk to people in class or anywhere, you're wrong. I'm sure you would love if people came to talk to you! Don't only talk to people you are comfortable with. Talk to all kinds of people! It will help you become a more complete person!

&amp;nbsp;

**11. G.P.A. is just a number**
&amp;nbsp;
I'm not saying don't get good grades, but make sure you're not killing yourself over a 4.0. Although a good G.P.A. is helpful, recruiters look at your people skills and experience. I managed to get an internship as a freshmen year  even thought I don't have a college G.P.A. thanks to my ability to talk to people. Become a well rounded person and don't pull hairs for a silly number! (People seem think I'm saying GPA doesn't matter. Of course it matters. You should always aim to have a high GPA. I'm just saying, don't kill yourself because you got a 3.9 over a 4.0.) 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading guys! I just wanted to share my thoughts about college. This is purely my opinion so please don't think this is what everyone thinks. If you agree or disagree, I would love to talk about them! Feel free to ask any questions! Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, I didn't proofread lol.

392,DesolateCreature,1513878533,/r/college/comments/7lb2s2/what_are_your_preferences_in_regards_to_school/,"It’s break and I’m bored rn.

**Backpack or messenger bag?**

Backpack for me. They’re more comfortable at a cheaper price than a messenger tote. More durable in my experience than a messenger of the same price (I have a Swissgear bag).

**Binder or notebook?**

I’m switching to a binder. I’m keeping one binder for everything. I got tired of my notes and things being out of order. I can’t take out a page (left handed rings hurt) and put it back in when I’m done with it. It’s a mild annoyance when there’s 1,2,3, and 5 subject notebooks but not 4. At least with a binder, I can arrange it however I want to fit the number of classes I have.

**Mechanical or wooden pencil?**

Mechanical. No more worrying about sharpening my pencils. I prefer .5mm lead. Wooden pencils are also more uncomfortable in my hands.

**Pen or pencil?**

I use a mixture of both. Pens for headers, dates, and boxes with important info in it.

**Highlighters or nah?**

More like meh. Highlighters just ugly up the page for me. I only use it for highlighting headers or boxes with important or difficult info in it.

**Physical planner or electronic?**

I prefer electronic. Things change and due dates can be moved back. I can easily color code my electronic calendar, drag things around, copy/paste, etc etc. There’s also the option to repeat an event and add a reminder to pop up on your screen. 

I use Apple’s calendar app. Google’s works fine too. Both are free.

**Physical textbook or electronic?**

I tried using electronic books. Honestly I did. My eyes skim over it even though I try not to. My mind is more focused on how long until the page or chapter ends than if I have a physical book.

It’s more expensive, but I’m going to stick with physical textbooks from now on. I guess there’s a reason why I can’t read ebooks.

393,saberslash127,1512982029,/r/college/comments/7j10ht/going_to_community_college_at_age_21_is_it_too/,"Long story short, I went to a small private non-profit university which specialized in IT degrees at the behest of my parents instead of my own wishes (they told me that its a sure-fire way to finish my education and get a job). Started college at the start of being 19 (I was born late and parents forgot to enroll me in school for a year), and got out by my mid to late 20 with an Associates in Software Development (finished fast because I took more classes and never failed once). Learned a lot more in that University then I probably would in other Universities that would force you to take General Ed classes. The Problem? MY FUCKING SCHOOL HAD DIFFERENT ACCREDITATION (and the accredited institution is shutting down). And I can't afford to pay for the Bachelors (its ridiculously expensive and without accredidation I can't get a federal loan). Worse still, I am already 10k in debt. The only benefit I see is that I indeed learn quite alot about Software Development and have a good prospect of job offerings (Uni has connections with companies).

Yet, now none of my credits will transfer to any other public school of my choosing and now I have to start from scratch. Now I am going to Community at age 21 and won't probably finish until I am 25 (that is if I manage to not repeat ANY classes). I feel so miserable right now that most people are one or two years ahead of me, even those that are younger than me! Some have even finished their bachelors and are only a year older then me!! I am totally lost, unmotivated and really downtrodden....I've always been careful about every choice of made in my life. I never did anything that would jeopardize my future (drinking, drug addiction, police arrest) but this one was perhaps the greatest blow to me personally as i felt I was doing everything right but instead wasted almost two years of my already accelerating young adult life...Whats perhaps worse is that I perhaps missed out on the most exciting part of College life (dorms, state college, school events, friends) because of me not being assertive enough to choose the college of my choosing. 

Anyone here have advice for me?

394,memorilane,1511997147,/r/college/comments/7ghmse/should_i_stick_with_accounting_or_should_i_change/,"I'm an introvert, I'm quiet, not very social, and prefer to work alone. I was born an introvert, and I've been quiet my whole life. I don't mind working with numbers, so accounting seems suitable for me. It's also in demand and it's a stable job.

But I thought of majoring in graphic design and product design. Those jobs seem fun to me and I've always been interested in art/design. I'm good at drawing and I have a creative mind. I also want to learn photoshop. I want to work in the art/design industry. But those jobs aren't in demand and it's risky to major in art/design; it's hard to be successful in the art/design industry since there's too much competition. Graphic design is an unstable job. I don't know about product design. The only reason why I want to be a product designer is so I can work for Sanrio (the company that makes Hello Kitty products) my dream job. But I have to communicate and network a lot being a graphic/product designer. I feel like that's too hard for me to do, since I'm socially awkward and have poor socialization/communication skills. If I decide to major in product design then I have to go to art/design school for that and art school is too expensive (around 40-60k per year) and will leave me in major debt.

What major suits/fits me best? I can do accounting as my day job and do art/design on the side, on my free time. Or I can choose the art/design route and try to aim for my dream career and work for the company that I love. My heart says to do art/design but my conscience says to do accounting. I already declared my major to be accounting since that seems like a better and safe option for me. Can I also minor in graphic design with an accounting major?

396,sludgerants,1506922569,/r/college/comments/73qyt2/should_i_transfer_colleges/,"I'm currently a freshman attending Kennesaw State University in Georgia. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering and my school has a fairly good program for it. I'm pretty sure this major is what I want to stick with, but I'm contemplating transferring to the University of Georgia. I'm curious to know what others think based on my perspective.


Basically, for what I want to do, I'm in a pretty good place. My program is ABET accredited (which is pretty much a necessity for engineering programs), and it offers Aeropsace engineering as well which I think I'd like to minor in. You may be asking why I'd want to transfer. Here is a list of the reasons:


For one, my girlfriend goes there. Before anyone is quick to judge me or says I should pursue my career and not a girl, just hear me out. This girl is the one. I really love her and at some point she is the girl I plan to marry, start a family with, and spend the rest of my life with. We have been dating for almost two years and this is as real as it gets. Even if I don't transfer, we will still stay together. Transferring just will make us both much happier and make managing our relationship much easier. Although this is probably the biggest reason, it's not the only one.


UGA also has a Mechanical Engineering program. It's very new and not yet ABET accredited, but will likely be before I graduate (they are seeking the accreditation next year). It's also a big name school and I'm sure I'll still get a quality education even if it's a step down for me academically; however, they don't offer aerospace engineering as a major or minor and I'm interested in possibly getting a pilot license when I get older as aviation has always interested me.


Another pro to transferring, however, is that I'm struggling with feelings of sadness and depression a lot here. The campus of the university I live on and take my classes on is depressing. No one is social, I don't really have any friends after months of being here and don't think I'll ever really find anyone I'm compatible to be friends with, and I'm just overall lonely and miss my girlfriend (going back to first reason I want to transfer). This wouldn't be the case at UGA. I'm not a huge party person (it's a party school for those who don't know), but I have my girlfriend and other friends there as well as be able to likely make more friends which I don't see happening here. The people here just aren't my people.


The next reason is just that; I can't see myself here for another 4 years. Sure this school has a few perks such as cost, closeness to home, and a better program for my major, but it has so many drawbacks as well.


Overall, if this was too long and you didn't want to read it or if you just need something more concise to see:


PROS:


- I will be happier
- My girlfriend will be happier
- The food is better
- I won't be sad or depressed
- It's a big name school that will still offer a useful degree in my field (assuming it becomes accredited)


CONS:


- Overall tuition and costs is more expensive
- I will be farther away from home
- The mechanical engineering program is newer, not yet ABET accredited (although I am fairly certain it will be soon well before I graduate), and slightly worse than KSU's


In conclusion, I just feel like there is more to college than just building a foundation for a career. I know choices I make now will affect my future, but I need a social future and relationships too, not just a career and a job. I consider that just as important especially because I only have one life and can only experience my undergrad years once. I think I'm willing to sacrifice a little more money and a little better engineering program for that. I'm still questioning myself though and it's a big decision and I just am looking to see someone else's perspective. Am I being level-headed or is this a completely ridiculous thought? Any feedback at all is appreciated.

College is vastly approaching and I have finally crammed my day with the task of registering for my classes.  I have came to the conclusion of studying to be a ""Diagnostic Medical Sono""  or an Ultrasound Tech for short.  I have been assigned the class ""Bio 160"" which is where we reach our problem.  I ventured onto our school website to see what textbooks I need and I see 2 books that are ""Required"" per say the professor.  The total of the two books is $400 something dollars which is a lot.  So I did my research and lots and lots of people say that everyone should ""wait until the first day to see if you need the textbook,"" ""don't even buy the textbook,"" ""just google everything and you'll be fine.

I pretty much knew this would happen. Its only my second day here and I already feel like the loser I was back in highschool. My best (and only) friend now lives four hours away, and I dont know a single person here other than my roommate who doesnt seem to have much in common with me, although he seems like a nice enough guy, although a year younger and seemingly more immature than me. He already has a bunch of friends here from HS, so I feel pretty alone and I'm afraid im starting to already sense that its always going to be this way.

I'm a guy, very thin and pale, I can't afford any clothes so I still dress like an overgrown eighth grader, and I can't lift weights, or exercise at all, because I have 2 herniated disks in my spine apparently, and im basically going to be fucked in that regard for the rest of my forseeable life.

All of my friends in the past have either stabbed me in the back or left me behind. My dad left me when I was 10 and I've been abused ever since, not to mention depressed, murderous, and suicidal for three years. Yet somehow I still feel guilty for leaving home.

I feel inferior to everyone and don't see the point in trying to make friends or talk to girls because I know I won't fit in and I'll get rejected by every girl I talk to because I'm either too ugly or not a fratboy jock with big muscles and nice features and rich parents. Every club at this fucking school is either empty, inactive, religious based, or 100% nothing more than resume padding boredom. I cant play sports because of my back and I dont party because of growing up with an alcoholic, not to mention, I used to be deep into drugs myself and it got me into all sorts of horrific shit.

Everyone says college is so much different than highschool, but it doesnt seem to be different at all. Only percievable difference from everything ive looked up is that its more expensive and its easier for kids to buy shittons of drugs. Its just as cliquey and the social hierarchy becomes even more cemented in place, as now, people are on their own, not to mention, living with one another.

I thought maybe I'd get used to it. Unfortunately, it just eats at me. I'm too anxious to leave my dormroom now because I'll have to talk to people and they might wonder why I've just been in my dormroom this whole time. Or maybe they'll pick up how needy I am if I want to hang out with them. I can already tell there are a couple cool, confident people on my floor who are going to take up all the attention, form a gang, and not want to have me around since I'm not like them.

I am starting my second year at community college. I have almost completed my AAS in Liberal Arts, which will save me a lot of money in the long run. I have decided to major in English for Secondary Education, and apply at one of the colleges I liked during my senior year of High School. I was a little put off by the college at first because my Mom believed it was a teacher college and did not want me to be a teacher. I didn’t want to disappoint her even though it was a career I was considering. 

One of the top things I am worried about is cost. It is a decently expensive school. I had received a respectable scholarship before when I last applied, but that means nothing now. I know transfers sometimes get less aid, but the college says they still have several opportunities to receive scholarships and grants. I currently maintain around a 3.62 GPA, I will be working to raise it some this year to try to secure more aid. I can’t join any clubs because I work and go to school full time. Are there any grants or scholarships anyone knows I might be able to get for going into teaching? Is this something I need to as my advisor at community college? I would do a work study if possible, and try to become an RA (not just for benefits it sounds really interesting). I may have $80,000 in loans which is why I’m think of more options that I might have. I would like to at least keep it at $50,000 (because if I’m lucky that’s what I’ll be making). 
There are less expensive schools, but there are several reasons this college is my first pick as a transfer. It has great career rates for six months to year after graduation. Most students have a job in their field, while the others go back to school. Most people are able to build connections there to build their careers. There’s tons of clubs, and sports teams. An amazing campus, located in a safe small town that is not too far from the city. Many of the other major college almost always have 2-3 deaths and multiple stabbing/isolated shootings/muggings on campuses. 
The second problem I’m worried about would have to be the dining hall. I have Celiac Disease, so no gluten and I have to be careful about cross contamination. I know this is something I have to speak to the college about but I have to see if I could either excuse myself from the dining plan or if they actually have safe food I can eat. Does anyone have any tips for asking about this?

Again, I’m trying to see if anyone has tips that could help me with anything in the sort of plan that I have please let me know. I’m a slightly organized mess compared to my normally spotless self.

Ive dropped out once when I was an anthropology major then went to my local community college where I recieved my degree in computer science; with a suboptimal GPA of 3.9.

I transferred to an expensive private school which I'm still enrolled in but on a leave because of work schedule conflicts (I work full time to take care of my disable mother while going to school.)

I applied to a state college to ease the financial burden college has brought and got accepted (hooray!) Unfortunately the school will not accept me into their engineering program and has given me a transfer GPA of 3.4 instead of my 3.9. I believe its because some classes from when I dropped out calculated as f's whereas the other school did not count them.

I'm at a crossroads. I can continue with computer science at the expensive school part time most likely; or I can attend the state college and change my major. I'm undecided on what I'll change to but it'll most likely be political science, finiance, or accounting. 

I guess I'm asking for some advice on what to do. I still love computer science even if my passion as dwindled a little because of life getting in the way. I always doubt my math background with the major too. I retaught myself algebra while taking precalculus. 

On the other hand a new school and new major could be just what I need (I wasnt fond of the people at the old school) but the school size is very intimidating. And part time means I'll be in college even longer. (Hooray /s.)

A last option is taking a promotion at work and hating myself for the rest of my life. I'm only putting this in as a joke lol.

405,dablkshadoe,1499506449,/r/college/comments/6m04iw/did_i_make_the_right_decision/,"So I used to go to a rather small, expensive liberal arts college in a rural area and my intended major was Creative Writing. I decided to transfer off the bat. That school was only a gateway, so to speak, and my mom forced me to go anyways. I wanted a school that was less white, less expensive, and less isolated.

I applied to a few good schools and some safeties. When acceptance letters came 'round, the decison was basically between Columbia University and Brooklyn College. 

Applying to schools, I didn't really have a top choice. I'd categorized Brown, Brooklyn, and Univeristy of Washington as the most reasonable choices-- though out of those I only got into Brooklyn. But I wasn't excited about them or any other schools. However, when the time came to make decisions, everyone-- naturally-- said Columbia was the obvious choice. 

As I said, I wasn't excited about either school. And Brooklyn was a whole lot cheaper. Columbia didn't offer me that much aid, and although my mom could she wasn't willing to pay the other end of the price. (I also wouldn't be sure if she'd even pay that end of the deal, as she's been iffy before about tuition. We have a bad relationship, btw.) I kinda thought I'd end up at Brooklyn at the start of applying, but ppl kept telling me the price was worth it for an Ivy. So then subconsciously I started thinking the same. (Also subconsciously, maybe my primary aversion to the school was rooted in the Imposter Syndrome I felt as a legacy kid.)

The thing is, I'm too rich to get much money, but not poor enough to afford luxury. But I also misjudged my situation. I thought I had 40K in loans at my old school and that combined with 40-60K I would need for Columbia seemed like a bad bet. Especially with such a precarious major.

But the big buster is this: I just found out that I only have 12K without interest in loans from my old school, and I've already made the decision to go to Brooklyn.

I guess I'm wondering what would have been different? One good thing is I have a better chance at financially emancipating myself from my mother, who tortures me both financially and emotionally. I also looked at some studies that said going to an Ivy League versus a low-tier school doesn't really matter in terms of post-grad income UNLESS you're a POC, which I am. This has me feeling pretty down. But we also have to factor in my major. Creative Writing. That doesn't have much job security in the first place. In fact, I don't think college is worth the time or money for it-- one of the reasons I wasn't excited for college in the first place. Perhaps, Columbia could have given me better connections. Though the Brooklyn area is on the come up.

It's a lot to think about. I want somebody to tell me what they think. I'm okay if I made the wrong decision. But I'm curious to know what could have been.

I absolutely love Northeastern University. The campus is beautiful, the facilities are amazing, they have all the activities I'm interested in, and their co-op program really is phenomenal. I live about six hours away from Boston, but I've visited it and it was amazing. One of my cousins works there too, which is an added bonus. 

Right now, I have about a 3.6 GPA (it'll be higher once all of my classes from this year get put in), a 34 on the ACT (33 without superscoring), and 1380 on the SAT, although I'll be taking it again this weekend and I'm hoping for around 1450. My extra curricular are pretty strong too. So, I think my chances of getting in are looking pretty good.

Only problem is, it's expensive as fuck. It's about 60k a year, but my parents have estimated that we should get about 30k a year in financial aid based on all the calculators they have. So, 120k for four full years (most students go there for five, but an average of two co-ops would make it four). We have about 30k put away, so 90k. I'm going to apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible, and maybe I'll get some merit scholarships from them. My parents and I are going to split the remaining and take out loans, so, at best, that would leave me in 40k worth of debt.

Is that worth it to go to the school of my dreams? Or should I go to a mediocre state school that I could probably get a full ride at? I've looked at Rowan University a lot, and while it's beautiful, it doesn't have the amazing opportunities Northeastern does. I've also been considering TCNJ and Lafayette, although those two wouldn't give me as much money as Rowan would.

Plus, I live outside of a small town right now, so I'd love to see how it is to live in Boston.

I was rejected from U-Pitt, James Madison, and Virginia tech. I got into University of Maryland and George Washington University and am from D.C. I was oblivious to the whole state school v. private until I got into GW. GW is private, more selective, and is in the heart of D.C but doesn't really have a traditional campus. the biggest thing is that I didn't get my shit together in time to apply for aid and would have to shell out $70,000. My dad is opposed to this school for that reason. I like UMD, but I used to go to a (albeit much less selective) public state school, and wanted to transfer closer to a familiar place (I grew up in MD moved to Texas than came back to D.C) but is it a waste to just transfer to another state school? My family isn't poor and my dad makes a comfortable amount of money, but the GW tuition scares me. I will have to hustle for scholarships next year (Deadlines for this year have prob passed). my concern is that I won't be as respected for attending a public state school rather than a private. I have two days to decide, because GW requires an enrollment deposit by June 1st (I already paid my UMD enrollment deposit, but am willing to discard if I decide to not go).

Pros GW:
-They took all my credits 
-In the heart of D.C
-Well known/name recognition
-OPPORTUNITIES
Cons GW:
-Too expensive and my dad is more opposed to it as of now 
-There is not really that traditional campus 

Pros UMD: 
-Pretty nice campus
-Well-rounded school
-School spirit and big 10
-I've always thought about going there before

Cons:
-Is it a safety school?
-they may not take all my credits like GW
-There is a risk of me paying out of state for a state school this first year even though my parents still own a home in MD. Will have to petition for residency (REQUIRES A LOT OF PAPERWORK)
-Am worried about being looked down on (I don't think it's rational, but it's a thought. I myself have never looked down on public state schools)
-The endowment for some reason is very low, but that doesn't affect me directly
-Crime and possible discrimination as I am a black girl

I am neurotic and notoriously get cold feet. When I was accepted to GW I started to get cold feet, same now with UMD.

After that, I decided I just wanted to do something I was passionate about after all and went back to the art school but this time wanted to do graphic design.

I'm just not certain how hands on I owuld be involved in these categories. Like would i help create the ads and make designs or would I be the one that promotes and just gets the word out there?

I have been in college for a little over 3 years and have fluctuated between majors because I have no freaking idea what I want to do with my life.

I went into college wanting to become an art teacher but taking the actual art classes felt like such a joke to me and started I make me hate art. 

After that, I was uncertain of what I wanted because I had always thought of being an art teacher my whole life or at least doing something with art. 

I hate not having any direction. My mom suggested I go for accounting because I like math and would make good money. I enrolled into the ""basic"" math class and really struggled all throughout the semester. The professor had a thick accent and was throwing too much at us, at once. I barely passed that class and just couldn't see me pursuing accounting when barely getting by in basic math. I did also take business ethics that same semester and learned I really enjoyed it. 

After this mess, I had a breakdown in front of my boyfriend. He suggested I go for graphic design because it would still be something I was passionate about. I had to get on the wait list for the class because I came to my decision a week before classes started and it's only offered one semester. This class determines whether or not you get accepted into the program and only 20 of 40 students are chosen. I think I made a weird impression on the instructors by enrolling so late and had an awkward encounter by showing up to their office and asking how I could get into the class.... I eventually got in the preliminary class. As for the projects, I think I did really well on them. The grade to quality ratio always felt off though. I would put so much time, work and energy into these projects and the grades would just be so upsetting and I wouldn't understand. I can say my projects were good and really pushing my creativity and have even gotten positive feedback in critiques saying so. I really felt these professors had it out for me for some reason. Idk why because I kept to myself and never like asking for their help. Anytime I did, I could always see the annoyance on their face and one of them kind of caught an attitude with me if I asked a question and didn't know about how to do something (they said they don't expect you to know anything) 

there was this one occurrence in particular where everyone had to have the moody instructor bind your book project together. She said it was my turn to go but this girl walked over to her and took my spot, as I was getting up... when it was my turn, she asked me if I would pick up all the excess paper on the ground and throw it away. This really bothered me for some reason and felt somewhat demeaning. 

The book project was a big determining factor of if you got into the program or not. When you get your grade, you see what the class as a whole got, anonymously, and I was in the top 20, which made me think I could get into this program. I didn't get in and now I'm back to square one. I can either, wait an entire year, not being able to take any classes, and apply for the program AGAIN, with no guarantee of getting in, transfer to another school, or change majors.

I really enjoyed the graphic design class but don't feel it was ethical. I feel they had favorite students from the get go. I was surprised I wasn't accepted because this was the first time I felt so sure of a career path. I really don't want to transfer because I am just so tired of school and at this point I just want to have any degree. I'm also just scared to have to start all over at another school. It's private and would be a lot smaller and expensive. The drive is also a bit more inconvenient than what I have now. I also just like keeping to myself and don't like an instructor all up my ass. I also don't want to feel forced to make friends in all my classes because they're small and it would just be weird to not have a friend. I just wanted to be in the design program at the school I'm in. I could possibly appeal it but don't know how to go about it and the instructors would only hate me more.

My mom suggested business because it's reliable and that I just need to get A degree because most employers hire degree holders and I just need to be able to make a good living no matter what job. I enjoyed business ethics. 

Someone please give me some words of wisdom. I'm at an all time low. It's devastating that something you've done your whole life and have been told you're good at (art), gets rejected. 

Tl;dr: didn't get accepted into the graphic design program at my school when I really thought I would.

I have 100 credits, covering pretty much any general education requirement and consisting mainly of political science, history, and English classes since I was originally pursuing a degree in International Studies. I dropped out after going a little crazy my last semester and basically locking myself in my apartment and avoiding everything (which resulted in more problems than just dropping out of school, unfortunately). Two years later, I'm seeing a therapist and (relatively) mentally stable, I have a full-time job that pays well even if I find it sort of soul-crushing, have some money in savings, and I'm ready to finish that degree! I took two classes at a community college this spring while working, and managed to get A's in both, a success for me since I desperately need to raise my GPA at this point.

However, I'm not sure what to do next. According to the career/academic counselors at the community college, there isn't anything else I can really do there, so they recommend transferring to a four-year university. I can't receive an associate's degree from them even though I've met all of the class requirements because I don't meet the residency requirement (would need to take 6 more classes there, and that seems like a waste of money). However, my GPA is too low to transfer to the nearby state university. Even if I did transfer, the admissions counselor there suggested that it would be impossible to complete my International Studies degree there without quitting my job since they don't have online or evening courses. Changing my major wouldn't fare much better, and would require me to pay more and be in school for longer. Both counselors suggested looking into transferring into an online degree program to finish efficiently and have the flexibility to keep working, but they didn't offer any specific recommendations for schools. There aren't any in-state schools here that offer online programs for a Bachelor's degree.

So I'm looking for any advice or guidance on next steps at this point. I feel pretty lost, even after extensive googling. I really want to keep my job because it pays well enough and I need the money, and coming from a low-income family I've been completely supporting myself for the last several years. I'd also like to transfer to a school that would accept as many of the credits that I have as possible. Which online degree programs through reputable schools would accept financial aid (or at least not be oppressively expensive), have a flexible transfer credit policy, and accept admissions on a rolling basis? I know that even with 100 credits, I still likely have another year or two to complete my degree, but I'm looking to finish it in the most efficient way possible while hopefully offsetting the cost by working.

The program I chose was Computer Networking and Systems Administration. The course description made it sound like it would be half Hardware related and half Networking. Only the first month was about hardware everything else was networking. Networking isn't my thing, I understood it but it wasn't what I wanted to do. 

I've been trying to find an accredited reputable college that has an online Computer Science program. So far I've looked into Phoenix, DeVry, SNHU, Dokata State University, Franklin University, and Georgia Tech. I will be relying heavily on federal aid and grants. I work as a dishwasher and my family is rather poor so I don't have much money. 

I would really like to go to SNHU for their Game Development program but I'm a little confused on their tuition costs. I thought it was $40K total for all four years but then some places say it is $40K a year, that's too expensive. There also seems to be mixed feelings about the school too. 

I'm also considering Franklin University. It is accredited by the HLC and I should be able to afford it, but I can't find if I will get a quality education. 

I looked into Georgia Tech but their Thread system seems a little wack and the descriptions of them are very vague. 

I've heard of the University of the People which is ""free"" and accredited plus it offers Computer Science. Because it is so new I'm afraid that the degree would have no worth to employers. 

Ultimately if SNHU is $40K total and not $40K per year that would be my dream school. However if a degree from UotP has any value to employers than I would prefer to go there first. The best scenario would be to go to UotP and get an entry level job afterwords to be able to afford SNHU.

I plan to save all of my money during the summer (with paying my bills) and use that towards housing next semester, plus getting a job.

After all of that I feel like my degree is worthless. I want to go into the field of wildlife conservation, but it is so small and hard to get into that I won't be able to do it.

I'm a freshman and my second semester is about to end. My college is pretty lenient about switching majors, but I honestly don't know what I can do. I would major in biology or chemistry, but I currently have no money for grad school in the future, and I would really like to work somewhere where I can actually land a job with a BS or BA for a few years as I save up for grad school much further down in life. I read that chemistry and biology are great and fun majors, but that they're awful as careers unless you have a PhD.

I'm great at art and astronomy and I enjoy them but I know a degree in either of those will end up useless in the long run.

I like to help people, animals, and the environment, but I just can't see myself going into pre-med or pre-vet given that my intelligence is a bit too average for those fields, and my financial situation is sub par.

I've made an appointment with my adviser and hopefully she could give me some suggestions and recommendations, but any input helps at this point.

**Edit: I want to thank all of you for your suggestions and input!**

 Honestly my biggest reason for failure was not only because I had a hard time grasping concepts, but also because I was in just such a shitty funk during this semester that I didn't prioritize this class enough due to the complexity of the professor's grading system and assignments. I realized I can't let it fly anymore, and I have to nut up and face him once again next semester, and I'm determined to set up 50 alarm clocks just to remind myself to do all of the online assignments I failed to do. Microeconomics is something I don't really enjoy, but if it's the only way I can get my marketing degree, I'll have to fight through it. 

My school is very small and really only provides basic degrees (Ex. bio, chem, and astronomy are the only real science majors you can get excluding the pre-med stuff. No marine biology, environmental science, or anything like that) and honestly my lack of motivation is what worries me about transferring to another, more expensive institution and risk wasting even MORE money if I don't find a suitable passion. I never really visualized myself as anything, but the most I can see myself doing is being a decent businesswoman. I don't know, hopefully I'm making sense.

423,LittleBitSpooky,1491700121,/r/college/comments/64ak00/im_a_professor_this_is_what_i_tell_my_family/,"I know it is college season and many of you are picking a school or looking to switch schools. I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. 

**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered ""top"" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an ""in"" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. 

**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, ""yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out."" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.

**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. 

**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.

**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. 

**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. 

 TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the ""real college experience"" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's.

I was not active in HS (did NHS, arts club, dance club, APs/IB english, but none of that leadership overachieving nonsense haha, had avg stats blah blah blah)


You can apply anytime for cc but it's better to apply early asap and do orientation if you want to early reg to take all the classes you need esp if you want to do it in a specific time frame. My cc has a program with hs seniors where if you complete the early program, you get priority reg for 1 year. If you complete the Summer Advantage Program, you get 2 yrs priority reg. I work at outreach so we specialize in catering to hs.
Depending on your major, students at cc take around 2-3 yrs to finish ge's and major prep (if stem then focus on major prep). CC is also good if undecided cuz it allows you to test the waters. You can take classes that you want to try and not worry too much about money.


Bae Factors:

-Assist.org

-Counselors (multiple to get diff perspectives, make ed plan that maps out classes you’re going to take)


-Transfer success center (they are ahmaazing): workshops, one on one appts with uni reps, uni tours, transfer fairs, help with apps and questions about the transfer process. Keep in touch with them from day 1. They have the info on transfer agreements (TAG, TAP, H2H, Special agreements with local campuses)


-Go to the damn office hours and even talk to the professors outside of the class/office.

--Get to know them and let them get to know you on a deeper level. I have met the most amazing professors during my time here. My econ prof has a PhD but he has a passion for teaching and my English prof is hands down amazing :) 

--You’re going to need references esp for scholarships, jobs, schools (private, grad, etc.), advice, etc.


-SCHOLAR-FREAKING-SHIPS and FINANCIAL AID

--&gt; if you have applied for fafsa, YAYYY!!! You are on your way to freee moneeehhh :D Apply every year preferably right when it opens. Honestly though, Finan Aid Office, Student Placement Office (Jobs on campus), and Scholarship Offices are keeeeyyy. Look into CC's that offer scholarships to Freshmen in the Fall. Like. HOP TO IT. We have a Buy-the-Book Scholarship cuz them textbooks be dammmm expensive.... Board of Gov's Fee Waiver is legit. BOG is across all California Comm Colleges though. It waives the unit fees, so you don't need to pay per unit.


-Career Services

--&gt; may host finan aid and job workshops, etc. They help if you are unsure about what career path you want to do and can even help with resumes and finding jobs on/off campus.

-Workshops, Programs, etc.

-- Stay aware of the different types of workshops that are offered. This could be bulletins, emails, classroom announcements.


Campus Involvement

I was really big on this for 1.5 years. (was zero involved first sem but got a 4.0 lol that sem) ASG (student gov), ICC (interclub council). Clubs (make your own club if you want), Honor Societies (I am prez of Phi Theta Kappa), etc. Like legit tho. I was basically everywhere. I was commisioner for ASG-went to the meetings=got to know students and faculty. I was also ICC rep spring 2016. This gets you on the email lists so you stay the first to know what events/opportunities are happening. (went to SSCCC conference this way) Conferences are also a great way to know other students and faculty from other CC's. You can find your diff fams at school. I basically know most of the faculty, staff, and students. It's good to be recognized esp for rec letters (SCHOLARSHIPS, private unis, jobs)

--Networking is key. Legit all about the connections.

-Outside Involvement

-- Pursue what you are genuinely passionate about or relates to your major lol. I prefer the first option. Explore, learn, create. Don't just build up your resume but also build up yourself.


-Internships are hella bae

--I regret not pursuing an internship (summer or during school year) This provides invaluable xp particularily in the field you want to study. You can also use this to figure out if you like it or not

--also networking opportunities


-Honors Program
UCI Honors to Honors Progam -- if your CC participates in this, then you get automatically into UCI CHP with 3.7 gpa and completion of H2H program. Honors Program also opens up research conferences like HTCC (Cali) where you present research at UCI (I was moderator 1st time and now presented research just yesterday lel) RESEARCH IS HIGHLY STRESSED ESP IF YOU PLAN TO TRANSFER TO A RESEARCH FOCUSED UNI/COLLEGE. You don’t have to pursue research tho so do what works for you!


-Job (if you plan on working pt/ft) –
I worked at Outreach Office p/t. I got hired as a student ambassador (found out about position through the emails) and then qualified to be a Student Ambassador (fanceh, huh?) I honestly LOVE my job. I get to educate students on the college process through application workshops, finan aid wrkshps, college fairs, etc. I wouldn't mind working OT. We do tours for elem, middle, hs, and others. --money and xp -what a great combo lol


-Student Life and Leadership
Again, they host events, workshops, etc. We have Student Leadership Institute that is in conjunction with CSUF (also accepted) where you basically get certified as a leader after completing a bunch of workshops. I did this and was on the committee the following sem.


-Programs and Services-

-Extended Opp Programs and Services

-Disabled Students P&amp;S

-CAMP

-Veterans

-more (it's late lol)

-If your CC has a first-yr support center, that is GREAT

-My CC offers free basic skills classes (excel, adobe, word) and even certificate programs (marketing skills, graphic design, etc) open to public.


If you pursue the CC route, really get to know the college and what they offer. I know this might seem like a lot, but there are so many services that are offered only to benefit YOU, the student!!


Tips:

-Getting involved on campus only benefits you through exploring your likes and dislikes while figuring out who you are. Once you get involved, build up your rep and word spreads quickly and you might land yourself on some recs/offers. Even PR might like you a lot.

-Business cards are hella handy.

-For every hour you're in class, plan on spending at least 2-3 hrs outside of class for study/review/hw/etc if not more.

-Positivity is key, at least, in my philosophy. No, seriously. Postive energy is infectious. I was an introvert when i first started, but I have found that I can be myself with limited judgement (people don't want to be mean to me lol)

-Not everyone you meet is going to be your best friend. There are those select people who will stay with you your entire life. Keep them.

-BE THE MOST PROACTIVE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. I was not proactive at all my first sem and missed sooo many opportunities...like scholarships... 10000000% effort and proactiveness lol

-It's not possible to be everywhere and do everything without crashing. Balance is key. and tea. Tea is soothing.

-You are not me and I am not you. We are all unique and have our strengths.

-Getting a BA is not everyone's goal. CC's offer certificates

-Do the RESEARCH. Scholarships, internships, programs, everything.

-Whether you are at a uni/cc/college, your experience is what you make of it. You could go to Stanford and do nothing. It is really what you do that counts.


Welp, I hope this helps a bit. If you have any questions, pm me. I wish you the best in your endeavors ! (gosh, that is overused so many dammm times but it's inclusive enough)


=major hugs for you and everyone!!! &gt;w&lt;= (I respectfully apologize if you are not a huggy person...here's a =high-five= instead :D)


Have a beautiful day/afternoon/evening!

428,fearlesspinata,1488231723,/r/college/comments/5wjmvm/contemplating_going_back_to_school/,"The thought of going back to school has been weighing heavily on my mind. To give a bit of background I am currently 29 years old. I originally got into a University out of high school (easy University to get into so nothing impressive really). I attended my first year and did ok and finished with a 2.9 GPA I think. Then I joined the army in 2007 and when I came back I went back to school.

At this point though I just didn't care (I hated school and still kind of do). I stopped going to classes and stayed home playing World of Warcraft and eventually got academically dismissed. Still didn't care and never bothered to go back.

Since then my life has been full of ups and downs. I was evicted and had no job. Got a job but rent was too high had to move into someone's garage. That was too expensive and I ended up homeless for a while. Still worked though. Anyway, life finally threw me a few bones and now I'm working full time in a career/field that I love but I seek something more. I currently am doing network/computer support for tech company out here in the Bay Area. Money is no longer a problem and financially I'm squared away. I married my GF last year (the same woman who stuck with me from my WoW days to now) and life is good.

I feel like now I can be in the mindset to pursue school and get that degree and elevate myself higher than I currently am. I ultimately want to get into software engineering/machine learning etc. I am actually extremely excited about learning of this but I am concerned about a few things.

If I'm going to go back to school then I'm going big or going home. I have no interest in finishing just a CC or transferring to any University. I have a very specific University in my mind that I want to get into.

I cannot stop working either. I put in roughly 40-60 hours of work a week. Sometimes I take work home. It isn't anything crazy and I'm free on weekends.

I don't want to spend 6 years chasing this degree. Go big or go home is my mentality at this point. My wife has her degree but she will be enrolling in a program for a health field as well. I want to be able to complete this in a timely manner.

So my question is. Has anyone here done school and work full time? What sacrifices did you have to make to achieve success and how successful were you? Based on what I've researched I need to achieve a 3.7 GPA in order to transfer to the University that I wish to get into. Is this doable when working full time and going to school full time?

I have no concerns about what sacrifices need to be made to achieve this. Social life doesn't really matter to me as I spend most of my free time at home coding anyway. What I am concerned with is - is it physically impossible? Does this require more time than I can actually possibly give?

I'd love to read your guys' stories and see what you did to make it happen?

But I was lucky enough to have a lot of support, financially and otherwise, from my university and so I haven't had to take on the extra burden of having to work part-time or be living without any money anymore. 

I want to help out other disadvantaged students, but I don't know what people need. Since textbooks and lab gear are so expensive, and my university doesn't really have the resources for students to borrow them (i.e. there's only one of each textbook in the library and they're not online; too bad if 200 students need to borrow it at once), so I was thinking that I could buy some and donate it to the departments to borrow from. But that's really expensive, and I don't want to spend all that money if it isn't something that students particularly need. I'm also going to try my hand at tutoring, and I'll do it for free if students can't afford to pay. I don't know what else people would like/need though.

One problem with all of this is how to advertise it without having a whole lot of students taking advantage of it, especially if they're perfectly able to afford this stuff. I want to believe that people wouldn't take advantage, but I don't want to be tutoring someone for free to get their grade up to an A when they can afford to pay, if there's another student who hasn't eaten for 2 days and is almost failing everything.

And no hate to the community college path, but it's just not for me and not what myself or my parents want.

I'm an Illinois resident and here are the schools I got accepted into:

Marquette (top choice)
University of Iowa (top choice)
University of Denver (top choice)

Loyola (Chicago)
Loyola Marymount University
University of San Diego

Waiting on:  UW-Madison (deferred) and Pepperdine


I have some other schools like ASU I got accepted into but I basically eliminated those early on.  ASU would be the only exception to that list.


I know I have a variety of locations, sizes, etc..., but I just don't know how to pick.  I made a top 4 of Marquette, Iowa, DU, and possibly UWM, but that's if I get into Madison.  Madison would probably be the most expensive school sadly.  I kind of eliminated DU from my top 4 because I don't think I can handle the quarter system.  That leaves the other 3, who are all unique.

I know this is a bad post and a quick one, but any advice is awesome.  I'm looking to do business or possibly Econ.  I'm into the business school at MQ and Iowa, it would be very unlikely at Madison, and I'm into it at DU too.

Price wise, in cheapest to most expensive, it goes:
Iowa
Marquette
DU
And presumably Madison



Thanks guys



Edit:  I guess I should quickly throw in some more things before I make my big post.  I do prefer a more campus school (ND is my prime example) .  I would love for their to be some sports that the students love to go to and a solid sense of school spirt and pride.  I do prefer smaller class sizes (2400 kids in my high school), but I'm not sure how much that will be a negative factor.  I also realize that a campus isn't that big of a deal but it is a consideration I guess.  I also don't want a commuter school.

I'm currently a junior in a Game Design major. I've been struggling a lot with an Animation class (this is the second time I'm taking it) and I am going to drop it this week as it's the last week to drop classes.

Now, I jumped into art and animation during my senior year of high school. I did well and enjoyed the animation bit, but I really never made art up until that point - I've always excelled in math and, to a lesser extent, science. Over the first two years of my college career I bullshit a lot of my non-animation art classes, until I reached and had to drop my Animation II class (the one I'm currently retaking). This was a huge blow to my self-esteem because it was the only class I've ever failed up to that point and it was a huge part of the major I was working towards.

I then decided to take a shot at CS because I was taking two required C++ classes and did very well and was really enjoying them. I took a shot at CS classes and... it didn't go well. I'd shut down emotionally and was struggling through all my classes as I was still dealing with the emotional blow from my previous failure, along with a few personal issues. I also tried taking Calc III after not taking a Calc class since high school, which was just stupid but I wanted to ensure I'd graduate on time if I transferred.

Even with that in mind, I have been doing a bulk of the programming on my game design projects and I've been enjoying it again. I've also been slowly researching scripting for other engines and languages. I believe that I can do much better when not dealing with the heavy emotional stress and if I take Calc I &amp; II again. 

My scholarship only covers through next year and staying at my school without it is too expensive without it. So I can't just change majors now and spend an extra year here. I don't have much of a choice anyway, since I really don't get another chance to retake my Animation II class until next year, but my workload is going to be tremendous due to senior project, so I'd likely do even worse the next time.

Any advice on the transfer process and breaking this news to my parents? Am I going to get screwed over in some way?

I live in Tacoma but I want to go up to Bellingham and attend whatcom then transfer to Western. 
As of lately ive been living with my dad and if I want to save up the money to get started there I need to move in with my mom and save more money (he makes me pay the gas, electric, utilities and cable bills). Sure I make good money for my age but also I'm 19.. I want to go out and hang out with my friends. I realize that moving away there would mean serious budgeting but that is okay because I need to go. My parents are horrible with money and don't make much and I think that's becuase they didn't go to college. My dad makes $60k a year and said that after he pays bills he has less than I do (he doesn't pay for anything truthfully, family says he always been bad with money). My mom says that I'll be able to get enough money with financial aid to support myself sparingly but I do still plan on getting a part time job!
I told my dad I'm moving out and he's pretty upset. The only thing that should be a huge problem is the car loan he took out in his name to get me a new car. It's about $2600 and we got it in November. If I moved to my mom's I'll able to put more money down on it each month, twice a month!!! But he wants me to go out and get a loan to take it off his hands. He tried to guilt trip me and say that if I didn't he would be displaced and all of this stupid stuff. That's not my problem, I want to go to school, I need to go to school. I see my grandfather giving my dad thousands of dollars to pay off his credit cards and then he goes back out to spend it all up all over again... I don't want to end up like my parents, I am certain that if the event were to arise in the future that I would NOT be able to depend on them financially.. I really think I could be able to do this and I want to do this so badly. My dad would most likely work with me on the loan, I don't think I could get a loan my credit isnt too nice (only because hed have me buy other things I also pay for my own car insurance and everything). No matter what, if I pay it on time or early (the bills) he just isn't happy with it and won't be. He'd get in my face and violent about money and bills anyways. My mom isn't too much better but in a different way, she's just crazy; I moved out of there because she would verbally abuse me. But just 4 months of putting up with it all I could pay off that car loan, save up $2000-$3000 and then go to school and create a future of financial independence! I need to do this!! My family on my dads side is dissapointed in my decisions and keep telling me to think it over so I said I would.. I can't ever make any of them happy and this is about me this time!!! My dad's upset because he has to be responsible or lose a house, my grandparents upset because I don't want to take care of my dad and because I already have a really great job and my uncle just doesn't want me to fall into debt. I have to do all of this myself because my family just can't support me financially but I know that I will succeed and when I have my own kids I'll be able to put them through college.

So I'm currently a freshmen in my second semester going to the University Of Akron. I come from a town about an hour away called Youngstown. Because of this, I live on campus. I chose this school because it was a nice school and  had a pretty good program for my major. At the time we didn't realize how expensive it was, (We mis-read and thought the price of one year was all four years). My dad left when I was like 2 so I'v never had one, but my mother does well. She makes a good amount of money so we live comfortably. We are not wealthy by any means, we have enough though, but because of this, even know she is a single parent with  2 kids we barely get anything from the FAFSA which is a bit ridiculous IMO. Anyways, she is constantly saying things like it's too expensive and stuff to like everybody and even to me, then re illiterates saying but, go there, I'm not going to make you come back ( and go to the local college, Youngstown State University) if you really don't want too, but it just sucks knowing how expensive school is and stuff. So I have a few questions.





First off, I don't mind going back to YSU at all, it's not that big of a deal to me, so my questions are.




If I go back, how hard is the transfer process, like how difficult would it be switching ( for the fall semester).






If I go back home that cuts the cost by a lot, as I'll be living at home, but in the end, how much student debt is the difference between them? Akron with room &amp; board: (	$11,064 ) + Tution (10,260), versus YSU Tuition ($8,087.28). This stuff confuses me a little, so I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I believe ATM I pay about 8k a semester. So how much difference of debt would this end up being?




How are would it be to get back on track? I'm assuming they don't offer the exact same classes, so are all the classes I'v already taken useless? 




And lastly; What is the difference between schools for future employers? I'v heard state schools are better, but I'm fairly certain Akron is a better school, would the difference between these schools be a big factor? Like would a possible employer look the other way because I attended YSU? 




Thank you very much for anyone who read all this. I'm sorry if this post is a little jumbled and hard to follow, I'm not the best writer aha. And also, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I didn't know where else to go or who else to ask. Thank you!!

I applied to 18 schools; however, none of the schools I applied to are the ones my parents REALLY wanted me to apply (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, MIT). I did apply to some they asked (I also like these schools) such as NYU, BU, and Fordham (probably not attending here because they want me to commute to fordham which is a 90 minute train ride and metronorth is too expensive for me) and applied to one Ivy (Brown, which they never heard about until I told them) as a compromise. They don't appear upset but it's just a hunch. My dad said that he wants me to attend a top 20 school. My mom would rather have me stay in NYC. My mom fears the posibility of me dorming and my younger sister told me that she even cried at that possibility. Recently, my mom told me ""You think you're gonna be all happy if you dorm. However, you are going to miss us and will want to stay back home."" I did apply to schools that are in NYC (where I am from) in case. Also, my parents make under 20k a year so most of the schools I applied to will meet all my needs. During the summer, I argued against applying to the schools they want me to go because I feel like I won't be happy there (visited Harvard and MIT and Columbia and I could not vibe with the environment, maybe cause of a stigma I have about these schools). Idk what else I can do.

Here are the schools I am applying: SUNY Albany, Stony Brook, Binghamton, Gennesseo, Lafayette, Union, Fordham, NYU, Brandeis, BU, Northeastern, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Tufts, Brown, Haverford, and 2 public schools in NYC.
From my list, my parents know the 2 public schools in NYC, BU, NYU, Fordham, and Stony. 

Edit- I think my father is most likely fine with me dorming (financial aid matters to him more). It's my mom. Also, he might help me pay for my college (if need be) since he is the only one in the family that has a job.

I go to a technology university here and we are not a social school. I've heard someone who dormed here and they said the school is still not too social when they dorm. That's because we are a high demand work load school, since we are a tech school. Don't even suggest dorming. Too expensive for my family. I love my school and the people in it. I am never going to transfer. 

 It winter break right. I have bonded with one guy who seems cool. But I do not feel comfortable asking him to hang out yet, because I do not see him in person enough, since he skipped class a lot. I have spoken to some other people, but I just haven't seen anyone as a friend yet. I have numbers of people from my freshman seminar assigned group, but I still do not feel comfortable asking anyone to go out yet. I am introverted and it takes time for me to really initiate something.

I had only one true friend from high school and he is a sophomore in college (Goes to a different college in North Jersey) and I have been so lonely for the past 4 1/2 years of my life, because all I do is hang around him and nobody else and it's embarrassing in front of my family when I hang around the same exact guy. Actually I had a small group of friends in high school during my high school freshman year, but then the group fell apart and the structure of my life fell apart completely. When I was in high school, I made friends in two months, but then I lost them all, because I realized how fake they really were, which resulted in me only having one friend who is still my friend. All summer long, I used to follow my brother and his friends (and sometimes my only friend), because I had nobody else to hang out with. It's been such a LONG time in my life (4 1/2 years) since I ever had fun and friends. Everyone else my age has friends and it just makes me so sad to see everyone my age and teenagers having the time of their lives. Youth only lasts a certain amount of your lifetime and I really hated my teenage days and I just do not want to waste it anymore while it lasts. I had 10 friends in 8th grade and middle school days are the innocent ages.

Is it easier to make friends second semester? First semester was just too hard and adjusting was terrible, plus I sat in the seats near the wrong people. I don't feel comfortable moving my seat in the middle of the semester, because human nature is that people sit in the same seats every day. I didn't just want to sit in a different spot like that. It's awkward. But now, I know the freshmen better (people in my major and the relative majors), so I will know who to really talk to more next semester.

I am not really worried about being bored this winter break, because my high school friend made friends last year (when he was a freshman in college) and he wants me to meet them whenever they're available. This is what I love in life: Making friends off another friend! I am actually surprised he made friends, because he has aspergers and now he just got a girlfriend too.

It’s with a federal agency that will be significantly impacted by the incoming administration, but it’s not even about that…I just really want to stay on campus next semester. 

I finally feel like I’ve made a good group of friends and have really enjoyed my classes this semester as well as the activities I’ve been involved in. Last year I was new to the school and honestly didn’t know if going here was the right decision. My classes were too big, my floormates weren’t great, I didn’t click with anyone in my orientation group or in the majority of the clubs I went to, and I felt really lost. I told myself to do a study abroad program in the spring so that I’d only be on campus for a semester my junior year, which at the time felt less stressful, but now I *finally* feel like college is a second home instead of somewhere to ""do my time"", which is literally how I used to describe it to friends back home some Friday nights.

The gig will be great for my resume but you only go to college once, and the dynamic that I’ve really enjoyed these past few months will be completely different next fall when I’m a senior and wrapping up my collegiate experience…which still feels crazy to write. A senior since when?! 

Part of me wants to email the agency right now and apologize for wasting their time but that I won’t be going in the spring. And then I’d email housing and beg them to renew my housing contract that I cancelled. And then I’d scurry through the course catalog and pick out classes that I wanted to take and be extremely excited because I loved my classes this semester too. And even just writing this out feels really good, even though I know it’s not practical, probably really impulsive, and admittedly more expensive.

Warning: I may sound rambly, but there’s just so many thoughts going through my head.


I'm currently enrolled in Environmental Studies and this is my first year. I applied to this program for 2 reasons. 1) I thought the only thing I was truly passionate about was the environment and 2) There was no high school math or science prerequisites (but in senior year I did take biology and functions). I did well in biology and all of my other classes, but finished functions with a 62.


Now, I'm sitting here feeling like I'm wasting my time studying subjects that I'm unsure of whether or not I'm actually passionate about them.


So I've been trying to do research on how other people choose their majors and a lot of it has to do with the core values and interests they had that were shaped and developed through childhood to adulthood. 


I was reading this article on the steps of how to find your life purpose (which I don't believe we are magically given one at birth, I was using the article as a guide) and one point that struck out was ""What is true about you that would make your 8 year old self cry?"" One thing I remember growing up was I loved the freedom to be creative, which is why I highly enjoyed creating stories and making art, and the other thing was I liked math. I loved the problem-solving aspect of it. It was like a really cool puzzle.


The problem was I have always had a very terrible attention span growing up and would always zone out in class. I was able to get by up until I got into upper levels (around high school) where I would actually needed to concentrate in order to succeed. I couldn’t just copy the notes down mindlessly and expect to understand them when I got home. I needed to understand concepts as those weren't things that could just come naturally to you.


Being stupid, I just didn't care. 15 year old me sitting in math class just thought, ""Whatever. I won't need this. I'll become something that doesn't involve math."" Goodness, if I could just slap my 15 year old self. I didn't realize that much of the basic concepts you learn in your first couple years of high school would be VERY NEEDED in understanding subjects like physics (which I barely passed and only took in year 11) and functions.


In year 12, taking math wasn't mandatory, but I took it anyways as I was unsure of what I wanted to major in and it could be a prerequisite. I originally was going to go into Environmental Science, but needed math to get in. I didn't have a job and begged my mother for a tutor to help me get a good grade, but she refused because she didn't see the point and thought it would be too expensive. That reminds me, the people around me is also another thing that really influenced how I felt about math. I felt inferior to my classmates in my math abilities by year 12, I felt my teachers didn't think I was capable enough, and felt unsupported by those in my family to try. Although I can't blame my family, my younger self couldn't see that there was much more than what others though of me. 


Anyways, knowing I could instead major in Environmental Studies early on, I gave up partially in math and made it my goal just to pass. I feel like an idiot.


I feel like maybe I should try it again and see how it goes. See how it would be if I actually really tried. Again, it's a lot harder for me since I missed out on a lot of basic math concepts early on in high school due to being immature and careless. 


In preparation for switching into a  science major, I might take the chemistry course at my university next semester that is the equivalent to year 12 chemistry. As for the math, I could retake it online perhaps or if I do decent in chemistry, my combined math and science mark would make me applicable for a science major. I know in many STEM programs you have to take calculus though and I'm not sure if it would be too tough for me. What do you think? Is it worth it? Or should I just give up and be a liberal arts major?

This means I'm currently in the process of doing transfer applications for schools. 

As of now I have 4 options of where I want to continue my studies, but I was hoping to narrow it down a little bit more with your help. To further help with whatever helpful advice I would be receiving, I just want to add that I plan to become an English teacher for Japanese High School students in Japan (So probs Major in English, Minor in Japanese/Double major in them/Major in Japanese, Minor in English. Not sure which is best)

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in the Philippines:**


•	**+**The most feasible path. It's my Motherland so I have no qualms in studying here, especially in my Alma Mater


•	**+**My dad will be able to pay for the tuition even without the need for scholarships (though a scholarship will be beneficial in any case). 


•	**+**I'll be able to see all my cousins, friends, classmates, and everyone I know again. I'll also be able to jam and have fun with them.


•	**-**It'll be tough to have a part time job here while having a College life. Also internet is shitty.


•	**-**I've lived here for 16 years. It's not a bad thing, but the world is so much more than just studying in my Alma Mater and living in the Philippines. I want to meet new people, experience a different culture, have an adventure, live independently

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in Hawaii:**


•	**+**I'm already studying here, so I'm getting used to how College is in the university I am right now. I just need to apply for a Student Visa to continue studying here or anywhere in the U.S.


•	**+**I have a part time job here while still being able to maintain good grades (A's and B's).


•	**+**Kawaii Kon


•	**-**Tuition is expensive as fuck. My dad can pay for it as of now, but once he returns to the Philippines, his salary will lessen and won't be enough to pay for my college while providing the necessary needs for the family.


•	**-**Additional expenses for dorming cause I’ll be living by myself. It’s roughly the same price as the tuition of my university right now. Meaning around 20k total. But I have made many friends here in my 2 years of living so there might be a chance that I can live with them.

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in the Mainland:**


•	**+**New adventure. New experiences. New culture. New life


•	**+**Currently applying to Boston College and Boston University (Not sure which is better). So as much as the education here in Hawaii is good, I know I can receive a better education in the mainland. I also heard from my Japanese co-workers that the people and place in Boston is pretty nice.


•	**-**More expensive tuition plus dorming. I can probably get a part time job here though.

&amp;nbsp;



**Studying in Japan:**


•	**+**Probably the best way to improve my Japanese since I’ll be living in the country itself


•	**+**New adventure. New experiences. New culture. New life. I’ve never been to Japan. It’s one of my goals to be there at least once, see the cherry blossoms, buy anime merchandise, visit famous places, etc etc. I just love Japan. 


•	**-**Language barrier. I’m not fluent in the language yet. I’m still learning (in Japanese 201 right now). I’ve sought advice and people have told me to try applying to Tokyo University as it accepts many international applicants. But to my knowledge, it’s like the Harvard or Boston of Japan, so it only accepts the best of the best. There's bound to be an entrance test too. I’ve also heard that international applicants who apply there are already fluent in Japanese.I think you can take supplementary Japanese classes though to help you catch up with things.


•	**-**Tuition and dorming are probably less expensive than Mainland, but still expensive. I’m planning to see the Japanese consulate here for anything about scholarships for studying there. I know one of them would be the Monbukagakusho Scholarship but that’s pretty hard to obtain.



&amp;nbsp;



As for FAFSA, I’m a non-U.S. citizen, but I’m still applying for it anyway to see if I can get anything. I won’t lose anything doing it anyway. I’m also currently finding scholarships for international transfer students and international students in general. 

&amp;nbsp;



So yeah! I’m sorry this was pretty long. I just wanted to give enough information to show that I did do my research first before posting here, and to answer probably most of the questions needed to give a substantial advice. I do hope that this situation wasn’t too specific that it’ll get deleted or too vague that it’ll be hard to comprehend :)

I kind of really regret that now. Keeping the cost down and not commuting meant going to a less than stellar state school. I didn't take into consideration much the location or the program, and now I wish I did.  

I think if I could go back 3 years ago, I'd either just go to an expensive school right out of the gate and take the extra debt OR go to a commuter school or satelite campus then transfer (like Penn State satelite campus and transfer to Penn State main campus). I told my younger brother this, because he is doing the same thing I was.

It's just too late now to transfer, unless I'd want to stay an extra year. I have enjoyed my time here, made friends, and I think I'll have no problem getting a job. Though, the campus and program itself has just been not so good, you definitely get what you paid for.

445,ThePaulitician,1478333250,/r/college/comments/5b8z1z/i_need_help_and_advice_badly/,"I am currently a freshman at a school I do not want to be attending. This is mostly the fault of the family I was born into and the family I was brought up in and how both were extremely parts of my life that I was forced to live in.

I grew up in a large suburban town (population 250,000+) and my early years of schooling were great. I was a straight A student throughout all of elementary and middle school. I excelled in the advanced programs I had been put into and was very good at basketball and most sports as I was a natural at all of them.

High school was where it all ultimately changed for the worse despite my efforts to continue to be a contributing factor to society. When I was least expecting my academic career (the only career I had anymore) to go downhill, it did, and it wasn't even my fault. I continued to take advanced classes by enrolling in many AP courses in high school, most of which I did well in and passed the exams, saving myself about a year in time and money of college coursework. However, I could have certainly done better if it were not for my extremely detrimental domestic situation. To put a long story short, my father ""cheated"" on my mom for about 9 months before she found out. Once she found out, it was around the beginning of my sophomore year. Since that period, there were non-stop arguments, fights, and bickering between the 2 of them. This went on for about 2 years (so from early sophomore year to early senior year) and has since come to a halt for all intensive purposes. To be honest with you, I truly do not know whether or not my father cheated but at the end of the day, I say that his actions (infidel or not) had crippling detrimental effects on myself that I still live with.

Since this whole domestic instability, I have never been the same and I do not ever think I will be the same. I retracted involvement in sports partially due to not having my parents afford a car for me and because I no longer had the natural athletic build that I had in my childhood; instead, I was extremely skinny and I tried working out to an appropriate extent for my age but I never got back to where I should have been. My mother and father continued to be overprotective of me and refused to allow me to participate in contact sports, so I couldn't play football for example. As for my academics, it was so hard to stay focused but I did my best which was ok. I had no problem getting into any university that I applied to and received admission offers and scholarships from all but one. However, the scholarships I received were all partial and I was unable to afford the difference, so I was forced to stay in-state and I decided to go to a school about 3 hours away from home.

Life away from home has been very difficult for me. I don't know anybody here and I really don't even want to put myself out there because of my depressing and lonely personality. I don't have any family anywhere away from home because everyone on my mom's side died and we don't talk to anyone on my dad's side (they live in another country anyways). Life away from home is also more expensive than I expected it to be in both money and time costs. Therefore, I applied to another in-state institution that is commutable from my original home and I intend on going there for the remaining years of my study.

My domestic/home life has really crippled me and it's hard to talk about because I think a lot of people will think I am making it out to be worse than it is or because nobody else seems to have any of these issues. I was pretty much an oddball at my high school because I didn't do any sports for reasons previously explained, I was involved in extracurriculuar activities that were underfunded and unappreciated at my school, and I really didn't have many friends. I wasn't really into having too much fun either because... life wasn't very fun for me anymore.

It makes me feel so worthless that I was such a top notch student in almost all aspects and to think that my father (who had virtually no involvement in my education other than me giving him my report cards when the time came around) would think to do this. **It just sucks.** And I cannot put it any other way. **It makes me feel worthless.** To a point where I just stopped doing my best in some classes back in high school at times. *I could NOT cope anymore.* It was too much to say ""get over it"" and move on that fast because I had worked so hard from a little child being promised such great rewards and this is what I get... lovely. I no longer could take the curriculum in AP English because every book we read during the school year was about cheating, infidelity, or extramarital affairs. **I kid you NOT.** I couldn't do Calc BC anymore because I just counldn't find the environment or the motivation in myself anymore to study. And it felt so bad getting F's on every exam for something that wasn't all my fault. AP Chemistry and AP Physics weren't any better! I had tried so hard and this whole family corruption never went away in my mind despite all my attempts to set myself free.

I have been doing pretty good in college, mostly because I am not pursuing a STEM degree like I guess I originally intended to. I am studying Radio/TV with hopes of one day being a successful sports commentator or a political commentator.

I'm making the decision to go to school back home next year simply because I cannot afford to live away from home after this year and I think there are better opportunities in broadcasting back home where I come from. I will buy a car so that I can escape my house.

What made me write this is that I've missed class the past 2 days and it wasn't anything mandatory/important. However, these were the last classes before my exams in each class for next week. I was very depressed after having some betrayal and racist comments directed towards me by some friends. I stayed up very late on Wednesday night and missed class by about an hour on Thursday morning. However, Thursday night was a very depressing night for me as its my parents anniversary which is trash now obviously. They still celebrate it but it haunts me bad. I went to sleep at about 3 AM, woke up around 12:00 PM (20 minutes into my only class of the day) then went back to sleep **until 5 PM!!!!** I was so depressed and sleep to me is where everything goes away.

I wish I got out more, but to be honest, I hate alcohol, drugs, and partying because I just never have done it as I've never had a real group of people to call friends. Whenever I think about doing something outside my dorm, I just pull a typical chickening out and then continue to play video games for the next few hours because its free. I'd like to think that this is just a matter of not having enough to do that interests me. I truly wish I was working already and was doing something I was passionate about. Then, I'd think everything else would come naturally and maybe I could escape this dark, dark place I am in.

I am a second year student at a Canadian university (Carleton) currently studying to get a B.A. in criminology and criminal justice with a concentration in law. I have done very well thus far, my first year achieving all A's and A-'s except for one class in which I received a C. :( I am currently in the first semester of second year doing about as well as I have done prior, with at least 3 more to go (possibly 4 as I was thinking of taking fewer classes per semester in the next years to ensure a high GPA) in order to attain my B.A.

Until recently I had planned to go to law school, pursuing a J.D. or possibly a M.A. in god knows what, but haven't thought too much of it other than keeping in mind I needed to maintain a solid GPA. Unfortunately though I understand this is a long, tedious, and very expensive route to go down for job possibilities that seem bleak. Should I decide not to go to law school I had planned on attempting to join one of the federal agencies such as CBSA, CSIS or possibly the RCMP. These jobs seem interesting enough and I have a bit of a family history in these. Should I not get into any of these agencies I had thought of just attempting to get into any position in the government just to get by. In any case, my degree in criminology does not leave me with a very wide choice of jobs and should I plan to pursue any of these I would need to become bilingual, a difficult task but one I believe I would be up to.

Given my recent realization that my degree is really not one that should be pursed, as I have been told by COUNTLESS people and nearly every article on ""what degree's you should not get"" I have pondered the idea of dropping this degree and possibly trying to get either a B.A. in Legal studies (hoping it would prove to be somewhat more viable for employment), quitting university and getting a college certificate possibly in computer systems technology or some other related tech field as I have always been good with computers and am very interested in technology, or even going back to high school and getting the math courses I unfortunately didn't do (simply because I was naive and thought I wouldn't need them) in order to ATTEMPT to pursue another degree (possibly) in computer science.

Fortunately my parents are completely funding my education and I live at home with no bills to pay. My mom is supportive of me but is extremely skeptical of me dropping out of my program as she INSISTS that university is a better education than college (the main reason I left high school and started in the program I am currently in. I really am unsure of what to do and appreciate any and all information/opinions that I can get.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, again any feedback is welcomed with open arms!

448,Hiromin,1476961814,/r/college/comments/58g9hg/foreign_med_student_wanting_to_study_computer/,"Greetings everyone.

I am a 3rd year medical student from Tunisia. (And I’m not a US citizen).

I would like to change my studies and start a computer science major, and I would like to go study in the US. However, there is no way my family can afford the expensive tution fees of US colleges. My parents’ incomes combined make around 13K dollars a year.

I intended to apply for the Ivy league colleges. After researching about it, I found that the top universities give huge scholarships to international students who manage to get accepted if they cannot afford to pay. I myself have a friend (same as me, Tunisian and non-US citizen) who’s currently studying in Pennsylvania university with a scholarship.

However, I recently learned from another friend that scholarships are only given to students just out of high school, or precisely between 17-20 years old (standard college age). I intended to sit for the SAT on September 2017, and I will be 22 years old by that time… According to this friend, it is too late for me, and there is no way the admission committee of any US college would make an exception, even if I happened to ace the SAT and that my grades in high school were great. (I have always been among the top 2 of my class, except senior year were I was 4th. And I was in pioneer middle and high schools [schools for elite students from the whole region]. In the bac exam [national exam for high school graduation] I ranked among the top 100 or so of the whole country [forgot the exact rank]).

I wanted to know, is it really true that my application wouldn’t even be considered because of my age? If it is, are there any other things I can do or add to my application to make up for the age handicap, things that would make me stand out in spite of this handicap and make my application be worth considering?

I am aware that I am at a disadvantage just by being a non-US citizen and because I cannot pay for college, and now there is this age limit thing that I hear of for the first time…

449,-Knockabout,1476928206,/r/college/comments/58e9f1/is_it_worth_it_to_send_apps_to_tons_of_colleges/,"So, if we're going just by money, it's a forgone conclusion that I'll go to my in-state school. It's a good one, it has most of the programs I want (good computer science, not much but a decent amount of digital media classes), and it's a good distance away. It's just that everyone in my family has gone there, and I'm familiar with it enough that I'm not sure it'll really be a new experience. I kind of want to just get away entirely, in an entirely new place with entirely new people.

So, I'm looking at other colleges. Like 10 others. But all of them would be much, much more expensive than the in-state school. They'd only really be comparable in cost if I got a full-ride scholarship or a very, very high one. So with how much each college app costs (the latest was $85), is it worth it to apply to so many? They're all good schools, but I would only be able (or rather, feel not guilty) to go if I got a sizeable scholarship.

For some additional info, my family is not struggling financially. The college app costs aren't nothing but we aren't going to be out of food or anything like that. I have a 33 ACT, 4.44/5 GPA, 5 AP classes this year, a varsity sport, and a lot of community service. I haven't been able to visit colleges due to illness in the summer, so I don't have a real favorite. 

From what I can see, many full-rides or similar scholarships (like Ohio States) are given to people with a 34 ACT. Is that always true? 

TL;DR: In-state school is great and cheap, but too familiar. Tons of out-of-states that are great, but are expensive and a full-ride scholarship is statistically unlikely.

451,ThePaulitician,1472744092,/r/college/comments/50ns4b/please_help_transfer_process/,"I am strongly inclined to transfer immediately after this semester to a school back home.

I am a native of South Florida and I attended the summer semester at Univ. Of Central Florida (UCF) and am currently attending the fall semester here as well.

My situation for going to college was largely based off the fact that I had a lot of AP Credits. I took 15 AP Classes in high school and passed all of the exams except for 2.

I originally intended on majoring in engineering but switched to Radio/TV on the first day of summer classes. I had taken AP Chemistry, Physics 2 and Physics C: Mechanics in High school and only passed the Physics C: Mec exam. I had decided that at the end of the day, the teachers can only teach so much in an engineering/science setting. Every one of these AP Sciences I took always had a first-year teacher or a teacher who was a rookie to the class. Now, they were smart and knew the material, they just struggled teaching it as it was very difficult material. And it would ultimately be up to me to teach myself and try to get help. I tried to get help, but then realized it was *just not possible* for a student like myself. I really had never seen such challenging, unfamiliar material to the point where I didn't even know where to begin some problems. So I decided to switch to Radio/TV because I am good at public speaking and already have some advantages with YouTube and connections to current students that are also communication majors (these students are not students at UCF though).

The summer was a questionable experience, but it was easy and I got 2 A's. The fall, however, is just as easy but I can't seem to get this topic of transferring off my mind. I had to change some classes for fall and was actually **running out of classes** due to the amount of AP Credits I came in with. Therefore, **the only way I will even be able to attend UCF in the Spring 2017 semester will be to declare a minor.** This is because the Radio/TV program here is application-based and requires a certain amount of credit hours obtained *at UCF.* So I would only be taking classes in Spring for that requirement.

I really just don't see much of a future for myself here. UCF is a great school for a lot of people, but **I just don't see a future for myself down the road here.** The University is in I guess what most people would call an expansion stage; a large portion of this campus is under construction and the school has recently developed connections to funding and internships almost exclusively for STEM Majors and are now looking at opportunities for other majors. Our President is getting very old (no offense to him, but he took the position of President in 1992!) and he's been a good leader that I feel he will be hard to replace. He wasn't even able to attend most of the Opening Ceremony here for freshmen as he left the stage early barely under his own control and he studdered with the teleprompters. This school also has a lot of resources and tuition paying for things I do not even use. There is a *huge* drug and alcohol prevention program, a Pride (LGBQT) place to name a few things and I just have no use for that. I'm sorry but this is college and I have no pity for people who are alcoholics or drug addicts for the most part and the money in my tuition that goes to that is just not reasonable to me and I'm not offensive to LBGQT people so yeah... On top of this, the Radio/TV program is seeming unstable to me. The first day of COM class, my professor showed up late with a very petty excuse and they subbed in another teacher who didn't know what she was doing for the most part.

All this worries me about a future here.

I'm strongly intent on transferring back home to FIU in Miami. Their communication program is application-based too but has less requirement including the credit hours. I also would find a job with the Miami Marlins and Florida Panthers to try to get a background in sports (the portion of radio/TV I want to go into) and it will also give me connections and the opportunity to work for a team if I can't find a job with my degree. Plus, it will be cheaper and I won't be paying for these ridiculously priced meal plans and stuff. Living away from home is expensive and I didn't realize how different it can be until now. I'm not homesick as I've done very well here as you can tell, I just think I have better opportunities and a path down the road back home at FIU instead of here at UCF. My brother graduated 3 years ago and still has not found a job with his degree and I just would hate to see the same thing happen to me.

The problem with this is going to be convincing my parents about it. They are very ""helicopter-ing"" as the UCF First Year Advisors put it. I originally wanted to go to a community college for one semester  (to avoid this situation) but my parents insisted I go to a normal school. My parents have this sort of pride I guess with me going away to school, but in all hoenesty, they won't be able to afford this place after the first year and they refuse to admit that.

I have until November 1st to submit a transfer application to FIU and I am confident at this point that I would want to submit one. I got a partial scholarship here to UCF and I have no doubt that I'd be accepted at FIU at this point.

Help!

How should I approach my parents about this?

For transfer students, can you tell me what influenced your decision to transfer?

I also am very not looking forward to making the trip to the advising office to talk about this. I'm not looking forward to the ""Are you sure? UCF is a great place to be!"" speech.

 I'm living in a dorm because my planned house roommate bailed and I thought it would be a great place to meet people. I have been hanging out with some cool people in the top floor lobby, but I don't feel like I'm really that close with any of them. Almost none of the people on my floor want to talk to each other, and my roommate is pretty much always out with his girlfriend. I've been trying to stir up more conversations with him and the people on my floor, most of which are D.O.A.

I've applied for hall counsel and a few clubs, but they won't be starting for a bit. Additonally, I plan on getting a work study job, but again, that won't start for at least a week. I usually get my homework done early, there is way less than I thought there would be, so I have quite a bit of time to kill these days.

I've even tried going to events via a ministry, (and I'm not even religious) just to meet people. There are some nice people there, but I think the religious barrier could turn into a problem if I get too seriously involved. Plus, they are a little clicky, and I'm not sure I'd fit in.

The only thing I haven't really tried is frats and the greek life, but in all honesty, they pretty sketchy here, I've heard some hazing stories, and they just seem expensive and time consuming. I just feel like I'm a little old for them anyway, so I don't want to bother trying to get accepted if they aren't instrested in upper classmen.

The bottom line is, I'm bored, I'm lonely, I'm getting kind of tired of putting myself out there, and I'm developing anxiety. As of yet, this experience hasn't been what I thought it would be. You're not constantly going to parties, meeting girls, so and so forth as advertised.

I'm looking for people who have been in simular scenarios. Does it get better? Is there anything I should try doing differentially? Should I consider transfering elsewhere? I'm just really unsure if what to do.

Hey guys! I've compiled this handy little list for you and weighed out their pros and cons. Some of these websites have overlap with the sidebar links, so check those out too!

**1. [The Common App](http://www.commonapp.org/):** Obviously. But what isn't so obvious is this site's helpfulness beyond the ""Apply Now"" button. The site is *jam-packed* with videos answering tons of questions that have crossed every applicant's mind. If you don't find content that answers your questions - you can tweet to their highly responsive [virtual counselor](http://www.commonapp.org/virtual-counselor). Clicking literally anywhere else besides the ""Apply Now"" button can actually be extremely helpful - and it's something most applicants miss. 

**2. [The College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/):** Now look, I know the site may not be the prettiest on the *outside*, but I beg of you to give it a shot, and you will definitely change your mind. This site is absolutely golden if you're struggling to find universities which suit you. It has an easily accessible [database of statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/SurveyGroups.asp?group=2) to help guide you through the first stage of applying: choosing your university. And let me tell you, it really isn't always Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, or MIT - even though they may come to mind at first.

**3. [IvyApps](http://www.ivyapps.org):** Alright, alright. Let's say you're a big shot and want to apply to one of these top universities. One of the most helpful resources I found during the application process was a database of full applications and essays that were accepted from previous years. IvyApps has a database of over 20 full applications and over 60 essays accepted to top schools. [Here](http://ivyapps.org/essay-got-into-5-ivy-leagues/) is one of their essays which was accepted to **FIVE** Ivy League Universities. Reading essays isn’t for everyone, and if you think it isn’t for you, I still recommend you take 5 minutes out of your schedule to give it a shot! 
*Payment Warning*: Their other content does cost money to access ($14). 

**4.  [Federal Student Aid](https://fafsa.ed.gov/):** So as most Redditors know, US university is expensive. Like, [REALLY](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years) expensive. And since not all of us are heirs to cottages in Martha's Vineyard, we all have to find a way to save money. FAFSA is a really good website which can tell you what scholarships and aid you are eligible for. The first thing you should do, before you even put pen to paper and draft your essay, is sit down with your parents and have a talk about money. After the talk is over and they develop ulcers over tuition prices, show them FAFSA, and be their financial hero of the day. You may be surprised at how much financial aid you are eligible for.

**5. [Good 'Ol Sal Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat):** By now, everyone should recognize the soothing and supple voice of the one and only Sal Khan. I mean, he's probably the only reason why any of us got grades good enough to even be *eligible* for college. But it turns out Mr. Khan now teaches just a little more than algebra and economics; he's teamed up with the College Board to produce lessons specifically designed for the SAT. So sit back, relax, and press play as you learn how to ace the SAT. I highly recommend Khan Academy, and as I like to say: a video a day keeps the anxiety away!

**6. [CollegeExpress](http://www.collegexpress.com/):** It's all about the money. And beyond financial aid, it turns out you can save even more money - yeah you heard me - MORE. Just by having hobbies and being good at school. CollegeExpress has been the best search engine for scholarships in the USA that I have found so far. A little clacking of the keyboard and *voila!* Thousands of dollars at your fingertips. I really do recommend you check this out, because way too few people actually make use of the free money, all because they were too lazy to write a few hundred words. I can assure you that if you've survived high school you sure as hell can survive a few extra hours on the computer.

**7. [yconic.](https://yconic.com/):** Simply put - this is the Canadian version of CollegeExpress, but in my view, it is much more easy to navigate and use. The landing page says it all - over a hundred million dollars are available to you if you spend a few minutes on the site. Few minutes on site --&gt; few thousand in savings, now that is some return on investment a hedge fund manager would beg for.
*Side Note*: I'm literally not exaggerating when I say you only need to spend a few minuted on the computer - some of these scholarships only require you to put in your name and email. Now that's cool!

**8. [The College Board](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat?navId=gh-sat):** If you’ve made it all the way down my post - congratulations, you’ve earned the reward of the most stressful yet helpful website on the list. The College Board is the hub of *ALL* relevant standardized tests: from APs to SATs to SAT IIs (yes those exist). What I recommend you do on this website is the following: make a checklist for yourself. Research all the standardized tests they offer and make a list of all the ones you need. Add registration dates to your calendar, and if you haven’t done so already, **MAKE A CALENDAR**. You don’t know how many kids wait until the last minute to study or register - make this your first move in setting yourself apart.

I'm an incoming freshman and I haven't attended my university yet. During the college decision process, it turns out that my top school was too expensive, so I decided to go to another university, the one that my brother attends and my twin sister will attend with me. That being said, I don't mind going to college with my siblings, I love them both very much and I get along pretty well with them. Also, the campus is large as heck, and I could easily get away from them if I ever wanted to.

The problem is that when my sister and I attended orientation, I just felt like I did not belong on campus. It's not that I felt alienated by other people. My classmates are all really nice and outgoing! It's just that I felt empty there, and I just did not enjoy it at all. The whole time, I didn't want to be there, but at the same time, I didn't want to go home either. 

My family is telling me to give it a year. I keep arguing that I don't feel comfortable there, but they all ADORE the school and say that I eventually will, too.

I'm not sure what to do. Should I try to immerse myself completely in the school and be postive, or listen to my gut and start the transfer process as soon as possible?

TLDR; I don't like my school. Should I give it a shot or start the transfer process?

To recap, I realized super late that the CSU I was signed on for was so, so not for me. I've been dabbling with the idea of attending cc since March but was too ashamed to move forward with it, but last week I did, and got all the classes I need. The cc staff are super helpful and I'm excited for my classes which start in 5 weeks!! I see this kind of as a sign, I'm pretty faith and instinct driver.

I've had discussions with family, friends, and everyone in between and my parents are 100% behind me. My friends however brought up a valid point-- **what if I get rejected by every school again?** and I'm dead scared. UC admissions are crazy competitive and I'm worried I'll get screwed over again. My friends keep on telling me stories about people with 4.0s from CCs getting rejected. 

My top choice is to tag to UC Davis for a non-stem, non impacted, pretty unheard of major. But if I got rejected once, who's to say I won't get rejected again? What happens if I don't get in anywhere again? Going to my 4 yr sounds like an easy albeit expensive way out. But I genuinely feel excited about starting CC, my classes are interesting and my professors seem awesome. My CSU classes were bland and my professors were unremarkable. 

I'm meeting with my cc counselor in two weeks (I'd go during walk in hours but my questions will take much longer than 5-10 minutes), and a UCD transfer counselor on Monday. I plan on inquiring about which classes I should take to prepare for my major and the like. I'm due to complete IGETC my second semester, and then I'm going to start taking transferable classes towards my major. I plan on sticking to ECs relevant to my major as well.

This is my last year at HS and I couldn't for the life of me get the college application process started. Basically, my dilemma is whether I should go and study biology or follow my passion (writing/filmmaking).

My plan was to major in biology and then eventually become a filmmaker. My end goal is and always will be that, and when I told my parents this, they saw no point in me majoring in something when nothing will come off from it.

But I absolutely don't want to go to film school. Film school is too expensive and a waste of time,  I would much rather be studying something else worthwhile. It sounds dumb and I can hear you think to youself : ""This guy wants to become a filmmaker and doesn't want to go to film school? What an idiot."" 

It's because my older sister went down that path and literally nothing came off of it, she isn't even involved in the field itself right now.

I wouldn't mind going studying writing, literature or history (or biology itself, i love that subject). But what do I do now?

Don't be surprised at the amount of extremely overqualified and intelligent people here. **They're all in the same situation as you are in**. Instead of admiring them, **focus on what you have to do to reach your goals without putting yours in the shadow of their accomplishments**. (They're used to 90s on every test, but watch them drastically fall off their high horse when they receive a 60, while you've been on this path for a long time, it's hilarious)

I know that you made as many friends as you could because you knew nobody there, but **devote time to yourself**. I'm not talking about Saturday nights watching TV, I mean time to **plan your life out and actually do some studying**. **Run on your own agenda**, not what those around you are on and **learn to say no**.

A friend told you to pick social life and grades over sleep, and you tried, but it's easier said than done. Instead of staying in bed, use the extra time to **actually go to class** no matter how ugly it is outside and to **study just a bit more for an exam: every point matters**.

Late night fast food runs are always great with friends, but you'll be surprised at how much money it adds up to.

This university offers so many **free services and seminars** to help you out and you should explore more of them as well as **become involved in clubs**.

When you're stressing out about something, know that **there are people there to help, whether it's classmates who are feeling the same way, friends who want you to achieve your maximum potential, or your professor or TA**.

**Develop a great routine and great sleeping habits** and stick to it. When it becomes automatic things like going to the gym becomes easier: you'll find out about that a bit later.

Also, **never lose hope**. Some assignments will knock you down, life will hit you hard, and you really do get homesick even if you don't think you are. When you lose hope it's harder to accomplish things. **Find solace in your future, in your friends, and the people who believe in you**.

Have fun, but **don't go out every week**. You have more time than in high school and are more flexible, but how you utilize it defines how you do for most people. Going out every week is expensive, and pointless since you're not into hooking up especially in loud, boisterous, moist places. However, **don't stay in your room all the time** like your roommates. 

Meet people, do new things create memories that you're still looking back on.

In terms of the other gender, flings come and go. **Life's too short to worry over one person right now**. In high school you were with the same people every day, but now there are more options. Don't pine over one person, **expand your horizon. If someone's not worth your time move on**.

Your greatest years are ahead of you. Make your mistakes now so you can change them, but **don't put yourself in as bad of a position** as I'm in now. **Put in those extra hours of work, stay until the library closes and go to another library open 24/7 not only during exam season**. Use your resources.

Also, another important thing: **keep an open mind** towards experiences, towards people, and towards yourself. **Be confident because everyone's in the same position as you**.

Have no loans to pay back and be able to start out on life debt free, have the option to take out loans for grad school but have a lesser education.

468,SoraKnightheart,1459955361,/r/college/comments/4dm56c/uc_davis_george_washington_u_or_u_of_portland/,"Out of all the colleges I applied to, these three are the ones that I've been accepted into (not including waitlists). While I like all three of them, my struggle is this: the order I would put them according to how much I want to go is inversely proportional to how much I ""should"" go. Oh, and I'm planning to take Political Science, but am also very interested in CS (and my programming isn't too shabby either). 

So basically, I feel that the University of Portland is the best fit for me in terms of atmosphere, city, availability of financial aid with 97% receiving some form of it, and academic experience (actually being taught by the professors as opposed to TAs), followed by GWU, which I feel is alright but not too special (and I'm not too attracted to their heavily liberal slant either, because to my knowledge the more liberal a university is, the more social activists there will be disturbing my student life), and finally UC Davis, where I've heard that most classes are being taught by TAs, and that the atmosphere was pretty cutthroat (and it's even more liberally-slanted than GWU). It's also the highest up there in terms of price, being an international student, since I managed to snag a 10k scholarship to GWU. 

But my ultimate goal is to make it to a law school, and I'm afraid that the standings of the universities will affect my chances of getting in. Davis is the highest up there, followed by GWU, and finally UP. But I've also heard that GWU is a little too expensive for the quality of its education, and I don't know if my scholarship would change that.

So is there anybody here who's been to any of the three colleges and can provide some insight into my problem? Thanks a lot.",college,"UC Davis, George Washington U, or U of Portland?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4dm56c/uc_davis_george_washington_u_or_u_of_portland/,1459973361.0

Recently I was admitted to Cornell and I would absolutely love to go there, but they gave me a financial aid notification that I would not be receiving any aid. Both my parents work and make just over 200k combined a year. They've saved ~85k for me in a college fund and ~85k for my sister as well. I appealed the financial aid decision explaining that around $12k of our reported income actually belongs to my grandmother who no longer can do her own taxes, that I have a sibling entering college soon after me, that I have a college fund with just enough money to cover a little over a year at Cornell and that essentially, without financial aid, it would be impossible for me to go. I received the reply to the appeal saying that they would still not offer any financial aid. It seems to me like I'm stuck in the middle spot where my family has too much money to receive aid, but does not make enough to afford paying for me to go. I live in northern Virginia which is a fairly expensive area to live in, and even with well above average household income we are considered middle class here. So at this point I'm just confused--how do the thousands and thousands of students who attend private schools pay for it? Is is worth it to take out 150k in loans? Do people do that? I have also been invited to the university's diversity hosting events and the university is paying for my plane ticket. Despite being denied aid officially via the appeals process, is there anything I could do in person when I visit, or anyone I could plead my case to? It feels as if I've worked my butt off through high school and used up summers for nothing right now.

470,Blaine_Gabbert,1459003692,/r/college/comments/4c1ewk/uc_berkeley_vs_williams_vs_the_university_of/,"Hi, so I'm a senior at a private high school near Los Angeles and have gotten all of my decisions back aside from the Ivies. I wanted gain some input on my current situation if I don't get into any of them. My current (top) options are:

1. UC Berkeley - I was accepted to the College of Letters and Sciences as a Political Science major and will most likely try to end up doing business at Haas. I've heard that Haas students make a lot of money just through internships and are almost guaranteed a high-paying job right out of college, but UC Berkeley is pretty expensive as it is. Although I have in-state tuition, a combination of my family and myself would probably still be taking out ~100K in loans for the entire four years. I would still think about law school if I didn't do business - but don't think there would be sufficient reason for me to go to Berkeley over Alabama in that case. 

2. Williams - I applied to Williams as a Philosophy major and will probably end up doing that or Political Science with the intention of going to law school. I don't know too much about what most people do after attending a top liberal arts college - go into finance? I don't know, so I wouldn't be 100% set on law school but would want a viable and comfortable alternative. I/we would have to take on about 80K in debt for Williams. Also, it is very far away. 

3. The University of Alabama - I can do any major I'd like to at UA and was offered full-tuition for four years and possibly housing for the first year as well as other scholarships. So I/we would probably be taking out 10K in loans at MAXIMUM (it's possible that I/we won't have to take out any loans). I was accepted into a few of the extremely competitive programs that pretty much give you priority access to everything at the school. At Alabama, I would most likely be doing a dual PoliSci/Philosophy major with the intention of going to law school (Alabama is an excellent pre-law school, very easy to get high grades and low-debt). 

As for my post-grad options: I'm thinking about:

 A. Going to law school (Yes, I've read a whole lot, yes I know how expensive it is, yes I know that employment isn't great for many law schools).

B. Doing business/banking/finance. This would be at Berkeley's Haas or Williams. 

C. Becoming a high school teacher. I come from a family of teachers. My girlfriend wants to be a teacher. It seems like a relaxed job, and one that I could be passionate about. This has always been lingering in the back of my mind, but it's no guarantee. I do want to be financially stable.

472,snero1994,1457306610,/r/college/comments/499qea/advice_appreciated/,"Hi there,

To give some context, I'm a female in my early 20s who's finally about to graduate this May from a community college I've been attending for 3 years (did this while working full time) with my associates degree. 

However, now the big problem/question is what to do next. 

My plan was/is to go into secondary education in order to teach math to middle and/or high school students. I applied to 5 schools (2 public and 3 private schools) and 4 of them are in my state (IL.) I was accepted into 1 public school in my state, the 2 private schools in my state, and the 1 private school out of state. I was offered scholarships to all 3 of the private schools.

The down side is, even with the scholarships the private schools are just as expensive (if not more so) than the public school. At each school I'd be looking at about $15,000 a year in loans JUST for tuition. So, more realistically, I'd be looking at more like $25,000 a year for tuition and to help with living expenses as I physically don't think I can handle working full time and going to school full time anymore (especially because in order to keep receiving scholarships and to be a teacher in IL you have to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA I believe.)

The point is, I'm really worried about how I would do this. Some of these loans would have to be private loans so I know the interest rates would be higher. Also, I already have about $10,000 in federal loans from attending the community college. So, in total I'd be looking at least $60,000 in student debt (and probably more than that because student teaching will require me to have closer to 3 more years left.) I am especially worried because my friend just told me (who is in about $60,000 in school debt) that after he graduates in May his student loan payment will be over $700/month! 

I know as a teacher I won't make much more than I am now (make about $25,000/year now) and my family is little to no help as I pay for my rent, groceries, car payment, etc. all my myself (although most bills are split with my live-in S/O.) I really want to finish school and I don't want to disappoint my family, but I've grown up poor and I'm terrified of spending my adult life being poor too. 

Oh, also I'm worried because I live in a stupid state with a terrible governor who is sucking colleges dry and not giving out MAP grants so I'm worried about not getting the grant money I was offered and/or being part of my way through finishing and the school closes and/or loses its accreditation. 

So, first of all, thank you to anyone who's made it this far. I'm just really unsure what to do and it's giving me terrible anxiety. Should I wait until I'm 24 (when I can take my parents off my FAFSA) and hope I will get more assistance as well as that IL will be in a better state than it is now? Should I suck it up and just deal with possibly being in WAY over my head with debt? 

Any and all advice is appreciated as I don't really have many people I can turn to and anyone I've talked to really doesn't understand that I literally have NO ONE I can rely on financially if shit hits the fan and I can't pay my loans/rent/etc. 

TL:DR I am about to graduate with my associates degree in live in IL. I am trying to decide whether it's worth putting off school until hopefully my state gets its shit together and I don't have to count my parents financial information anymore or just suck it up and possibly get in way over my head in debt as I have no one to turn to financially.",college,Advice Appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/499qea/advice_appreciated/,1457324610.0
473,deeadpoool,1456939341,/r/college/comments/48n4sc/live_on_campus_with_my_own_room_or_off_campus/,"Hey guys, sorry for the long post 

So I am in the process of figuring out my housing for this quarter. Its a little late because my roommates/friends didn't say anything until last week about moving out so yea. But i have the apartment until August. 

Basically my three options right now are :
 
 Live in the on campus housing(apartment) with my own room for $850/month(utilities and Internet included). I live with 3 other randoms but have my own room with a LOCK on my door. 

  Live off campus, and for this I have two options for two different leases 
     
       2 bed/1bath where I have my own room ONLY if someone would agree to live in the living, otherwise it's too expensive. 

     My current plan: 4 or 5 people in 2 bed 2 bath. I would have to share a room with at least one random and have my expensive desktop and laptop out in the living room. This would be about $520-$600 after utilities and Internet. 

The two biggest factors for me are the price and privacy. 

For the off campus:
Since I will be living with randoms, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the having access to everything I own. Also, I work on the r computer and have to talk to other people, and doing that in the living room(if i live off campus)
Would feel even more weird than it already does for me(and I know my current house mates from high school). 

On campus: 
the main con here is the price, and how I could save all that money. It will be a little less than how much I paid my first year for housing in the dorms. However having my own room is very tempting, ESPECIALLY if people I don't know are in the mix. 

What are your guy's thoughts? Is the privacy worth the price?
The other pros/cons have to deal with closeness to campus and convenience but they are minor things. Thanks!

474,Zarqu0n,1456389295,/r/college/comments/47hzam/german_looking_to_study_abroad/,"Hey,

I finished high school last year. Because I was still pretty young I decided to just take a few classes at college here but I still have studying abroad in mind. I have now finished my first exam. This makes me a transfer student in the eyes of most colleges I am interested in which makes matters a bit more complicated, I think. **I'm looking to study Computer Science.**

So, first off, I'm looking to study in an English-speaking country. Right now I'm unsure how to proceed. I'm looking to start studying in 2017, not as an exchange semester of my current program, that I simply enrolled in to spend a year or so waiting, but rather just like a high school leaving student from the respective country would. 

---

**1) The US and Australia**: Those are too expensive for me.

**2) New Zealand**: I like it, I've been there in September and used the chance to have a look around the University of Auckland. The other two Unis I am interested in in the country are ranked much lower (151-200) and even from the UofA I don't know how hard it would be for me to find a job in the US afterwards? That's really important for me both financially and because I think I will like it.

**3) Canada**: UBC. I think that one is perfect and is very highly ranked. The problem: I don't know if I can get in. I'd apply for Fall 2017, and by the time I can expect a response, I'd already be in New Zealand. Otherwise I'd apply for UAlberta as well but I've heard that one is pretty ""bad"" :&lt; It would be way better financially though, and still good for me to find a job in the US.

**4) UK**: Studying in the UK seems fun but I checked the University of Nottingham and the University of Edinburgh which I think would be good for me, and they seem to be veeery hard to get in for international students. Almost none of the students from our final year could've gotten in I think, and keep in mind we were the top 33% going to the *Gymnasium* in Germany. So already on the better end of the spectrum. I was #18/88.

**5) Ireland**: Seems nice to me as well. I think Trinity College Dublin would be the most reasonable choice. Although my grades seem to be not good enough.

---

So, now I'm a bit unsure what would be my best bet for the future.

**My grades**: For anyone familiar with the German system, I got a 1,9 final grade on the Abitur. It is considered rather good but I'm unhappy with it because I made the mistake of choosing Biology as a ""Leistungskurs"" - I thought I could brute force a good grade there by studying hard but I couldn't and it ended up dragging down my grade by a lot. On a 1.0-6.0 reversed scale, 2.4 was the average for students from Berlin. The average of my school was like 2.6 or so, it's also considered one of the better schools around. Although I don't think it was a great decision today, I would still consider that me skipping 2 grades was quite an academic achievement, but most schools seem to not care :(

---

**About studying in Germany**: I have the privilege to be able to study in a country where tuition is almost non-existent, so I always have that in the back of my mind if I don't find a good choice studying abroad, or if I can't make it work financially. I have not completely dismissed it but right now I'm trying to find a way to go abroad.

---
                                                                           
So, like I said in the post, I don't really know how to proceed. I would also like to know how hard it would be for me to set foot in the US job market with a degree from around the world, when the Googles and Facebooks of this world have Stanford right across the street.

475,4ndr0med4,1455679105,/r/college/comments/46691g/commuting_vs_dorming/,"Hello everyone!

I am a community college student who will be transferring to Rutgers University. I am still trying to give my parents the run down on why it is going to be a lot better for me to live on campus and risk going in debt than not. It might help to consider that, in this situation, I am the first person in my family to attend college.

My parents are not too keen on dorming. It is going to be expensive and our FAFSA isn't looking good for aid. This year, even with an EFC of 0, our state decided not to give us any financial aid and I feel they will do the same for my entire time in college. This is really bad as the aid they give me covers 66% of my tuition at Rutgers. They don't want to pay extra for me to live on campus when I already have a home.

They also come up with stories. My family always brings us examples of people who had similar situations. My mother always talks about one cousin who is studying criminal justice and has a very similar commute as I do (but in the opposite direction). They fear that I'll come out drunk or something but I have reassured them that if I don't associate with people that want to get drunk, it won't happen that often.

I live around 25 miles from Rutgers. The trip mostly is highway but once I hit the main road into Rutgers, the traffic is very horrendous. There is also a complex route of buses which means that once I get out, I might have to roam around to another part of campus or to another city where my other classes will be held. All in all, I might be spending 2 hours just traveling and this is similar to taking the train too.

I talked with my cousin who studied psychology at a school 30 minutes from her home and she told me that it would be much better if I lived on campus because it would be much less stressful to have a place to stay than just go couch surfing almost every day. At the same time, I would at least have time to do my own thing like clubs and such.

But, if you are fully prepared, you can easily make the transition from home to college life. Take advantage of the following 10 tips to help you get through your college years.

#Stay Organized 

If you are disorganized, you are never going to accomplish anything. The better you are at organizing, and we mean organizing everything, the easier your life, and your college career, are going to be. Keep a weekly planner and write down every important thing that you need to do, from studying for exams to keeping appointments and then some.

#Use Your Resources 

While you are in college, you will have loads of resources available to you, from tutoring to library services to clubs to counseling and more. Take advantage of as many of these resources as possible.

#Get Involved 

While it is never a good idea to take on too much, especially in your first year, you should check out some of the campus clubs and organizations to see what interests you. This is a great way to make new friends, make connections for future employment, etc.

#Get Cheap Textbooks 

Textbooks are ridiculously expensive, but there are plenty of ways to get them without having to pay full price. Check out websites like Textbooks.com, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon. Don’t forget to ask students if they are selling their old textbooks, and look for other ways to get used textbooks.

#Follow Campus Rules

While this may seem like a no-brainer, there are a lot of people who will try and push the boundaries, because they are on their own for the first time. Remember, you are paying good money for your college education. The last thing you want is to get kicked out because you weren’t following campus rules.

#Take Care of Your Pets 

Because studies show that students often perform better when they have pets in their lives, more and more campuses are allowing students to keep small pets in their dorm rooms. If you have a pet, make sure that you take care of its health by having good insurance (start with comparing pet insurance at Pet Insurance University) to pay for vet care.

#Take Advantage of Your Student Discount 

There are loads of places that will offer student discounts, and you can save a lot of money by taking advantage of these discounts. Use as many as are available to you, for everything from school supplies to meals to electronic devices and more.

#Get a Mattress Topper 

Dorm beds aren’t necessarily the most comfortable beds in the world, but you need to get plenty of sleep to do your best in college. You can make your dorm bed a lot more comfortable by investing in a good mattress topper. The more comfortable you are, the more sleep you are going to get, and the more alert you are going to be in classes and when you are studying.

#Check Out Internships – 

If you want to see if you are going to like a career path, an internship is a great way to do it. You get to meet people in the industry, and you will learn a lot. Some companies even offer paid internships. Ask the guidance counselor about internship programs in the area.

#Relax and Enjoy Yourself 

Obviously, your main goal is to graduate and go on to a great career. But, don’t let yourself become overwhelmed by study. You also need to take time out for yourself, so you can relax and do things that you enjoy. If you let yourself get burned out with study and don’t have fun, things may not go as well as you had planned.

Hello everyone,

First of all, I apologize if this question has been asked many times or if I could've easily found a better resource for my question but instead came here. I am just asking for your opinions.

I'm currently in the my second term pursuing my BSN and I am starting this term with an overloaded schedule. One of my professors strictly lectures and does not use any visual aid or anything of the like so taking notes as fast as possible as he speaks is going to benefit me in that class as much as it can.
I take great notes when I type and writing notes by hand is just terrible: I write way too fast and that makes the words look like chicken scratch.

I never owned a lab-top and I always wanted one, but as of now I *need* it. So what brands or kinds should I look into?
I have a 2011 iMac desktop that I use at home and I guess it's ok when it comes to apple products. I just do not like how it lags, functions sluggishly, and even freezes no matter how much I clean it out.
My classmate has a surface book and he says it's pretty kool, although, I never used one before so I can't say if its for me or not.

I'm *a broke college student, so looking for something that is expensive but if the quality of the product is definitely worth its price then I'll consider it.

I don't know much about computers and their insides and guts, bu  here are some things I would want with my new gear:

• Great performance for doing projects, presentations, editing and watching videos.

• The best battery life possible.

• A substantial amount of memory. I do not want to constantly be erasing and downloading items that I don't need now and eventually needing it later on.

• Durable, for heavy use at home and at school and to also survive my daily commute.

• Ability to plug into a T.V. or monitor so I can easily show or present anything that is on my lab-top.

Is the excuse because they are lazy? No because there is very little to no help from anyone.

I am posting this because I honestly don't really know what to do at this point. I've fucked up real bad. I am a Computer Science major and in order to take most of my core classes I need to finish Calc 1 and to be taking Calc 2. I took pre-calc and passed with a C, and then I really struggled in calc(and also spent too much time on other things) and ended that semester with a D(the requirement for CSCI and Calc 2 is a C-). So I have been unable to take any other CSCI classes because I haven't fulfilled my Calc 1 requirement, and now I've failed it again and this will just delay me degree even more, this is my second year (3rd semester) and although I do have a lot of my Arts and Sciences requirements done, I have only taken one Computer Science class.
Well anyhow, now I've failed Calc 1 again and I don't know what to tell my parents or what to do. With the D in calc I most likely am going to be put back on academic probation at my school and I don't know if I am even going to keep going here. My parents are paying a shit ton of money and IDK what to do. 
Sidenote: I do have a job I really like here that pays pretty well(for someone as qualified as me) and its related to IT which is great experience for me. The only problem is the housing here is insanely expensive so I can't just like stay here and work without taking classes (not worth living here unless im taking classes).

488,seveer4444,1448139651,/r/college/comments/3tqhvb/i_need_advice_on_how_to_finish_my_degree/,"In 2008 I graduated High School and ended up getting a large scholarship to the school of my choice; that scholarship lasted for the majority of my time there but with the rising tuition I soon found myself in a predicament where I had to pay out of pocket for school/use federal and private loans. At the time that wasn't too bad I maintained a job while I was going to school so that I could pay for tuition, commuting fees, and supplies.

Come senior year, I get ready to apply for graduation and I find out that I do technically have enough credits to graduate, but they weren't dispersed right across my degree audit; was missing 9 credits in liberal arts electives. This was due to an oversight from the registration official I worked with to get my class schedules each year. (Unfortunately she is assigned to me because of my last name; I can't meet with the other officials.)

So I book an appointment to try to get it figured out. I asked the registrar if she would allow me to take the remaining credits at a community college; but the registrar said that I would have to take my last semester at the institution or I would not be eligible to graduate. The classes at my school are very expensive so as of right now I've been able to take 1 class and I'm currently paying it off. So I have 6 lib arts left; I did make another appointment to speak with them and was able to work out a deal to do 1 class at a Community college and then take the final class at the institution.

My problem lies with the fact that right now I'm trying to pay on my loans which have accrued a lot of interest and also trying to finish paying off my institution. At the rate I'm going that will be in another 3 years. A lot of my high school friends have been put in similar situations but were able to get jobs because they were working in industries where you don't necessarily need a degree. But I went into an industry where a degree is usually mandatory. So in the mean time I've been working jobs that don't require a degree and are low paying. I've been trying to find something better but it's hard, I've been applying all over the place but nothing fruitful. I've applied at some blue collar jobs as well, but because I'm a very small statured person and thin frail looking person, those jobs are not keen to hire me.

The real problem arises with the fact that I've had several job offers that would have given me an actual living wage where I could pay on everything and be working in the field that I studied; but upon learning that I don't quite have my degree I was rejected. I just got a call from Nissan last week, they were very very interested in hiring me. I was brought in for the interview and they were ready to offer me the job, but then we got to the part where I don't have a degree and I was turned away. The HR manager said if I got my degree in the next few months they'd give me the position.
I have looked/applied for scholarships, and grants but to no avail. I can't take out any federal loans and will not take out any private loans because I have enough of those to last me a lifetime.
I'm between a rock and and hard place, I can't get a better job because I don't have my degree, and I can't get my degree because I don't have a better job.

I am almost at the finish line and I'm stuck in place.
Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to get these last 6 credits quickly and earn my degree; or know of any other options available to me.?

489,proffieh,1446653527,/r/college/comments/3ri9af/transfer_into_rotc_or_stay_put/,"Hey reddit... I'm having problems deciding what I want to do my next three years. I'm currently a first year student at a large public university. I'm considering transferring into the ROTC program at a private school next year... the University of Dayton in Ohio. I was wondering if you guys could take a look at my reasons for transferring, and see if they're good/bad.


* Simply put, I don't like it where I am right now. I don't like the campus, the classes I'm in, the people I've met. I even joined a fraternity, and while a lot of people in the fraternity seem to like me, I can't stand almost any of them. It's really fucked with my mental state too... I'm depressed a lot, my grades aren't where they should be, and I'm starting not to go to class. I know it's stupid, but I'm just really not happy.

* UD was always my first choice, but it was way too expensive (I pay for college by myself and can't get any cosigners). I absolutely love the University, and visit my friends there all the time. I love the people I've met there, the campus, the atmosphere... everything. The only reason I'm at this University right now is because my job pays for half of my tuition, my federal loan pays for the other half, and I'm not required to live on campus so I can pay my own rent. I'm working 35-40 hour weeks and am in class 15 a week right now. I know what you guys are thinking... this kid needs to quit being a little bitch and do what he has to do to get his degree. However, I'm a become more and more enticed by my other option at UD every day. 

* I always wanted to join ROTC and sign with the military but, stupidly, I got away from that dream my senior year due to a girlfriend. I'm still with that girlfriend, and am very happy with her, but I'm not happy with my life and where it's going right now. I think of joining every day... it's always what I've wanted to do. Plus, it'd pay for my college, and I'd get to go to the college of my choice. I've talked with representatives at UD, and they told me there's a solid chance of them being able to sign me and gain the full three-year scholarship totaling 99,000 dollars plus another 40,000 dollars from UD to cover my room and board, meal plan, and laptop/book grant (As long as I do well in my interview process both with UD and the US Army). I think if i really buckle down academically the rest of this semester / next semester, I can get that scholarship.


Honestly, I don't really know. I just read my post, and it seems like the obvious choice is to transfer, but I still just feel so hesitant. Has anybody else been in a similar situation, or have any advice at all?

VA Tech seems reasonable in-state (12k tuition + $8k room and board) . 

[Colorado State](https://secure.collegeincolorado.org/College_Planning/Explore_Schools/Compare_Schools/Compare_Schools.aspx) seems reasonably priced too for in-state tuition ($12k + $12k)  and we could move to either of those states.

I lived at home for a bit and commuted (1-2 hours) but moved up around the school off campus (on campus housing is too expensive and notorious for crime/rape/drugs) and financially that was a stretch. I am only attending here because it is cheaper than the other state schools (CSU/CU boulder are 3-4 times more expensive) and I doubt I can take out enough loans to pay for other schools (~30k a year in loans) and my parents don't have money to funnel into that either. 

I am told college is supposed to be the best years of your life (if not a fun time) and I'm absolutely miserable. I have no social life, no time for a social life, and most of my class mates ages range from 20-45. So do I try and transfer to a more fun state school or other college?

*  What jobs would I pursue after I get my degree? What are the most common jobs for people out of college who major in sports management?

The school I am planning to attend Spring 2016 semester *only* has Elementary Education. 

**English/Creative Writing:** The school I want to go to, and am planning to attend, have professionals who visit the campus throughout the year for those in this program. They also hold an annual Scriptwriters Showcase. They have a couple of other programs for this too. Now my only problem is, I haven't been able to write any poetry or short stories or anything of that sorts since 3 or 4 years ago. Prior to my writers block, I was pumping out short stories every other day and poetry flowed through me like a coursing river. I take interest in this program because I want it to re-activate my creativity, re-awaken the writer in me. However the downside is that the job field is really sketchy unless you are extremely lucky (at least in my opinion... but that's why I need you guys). 

**Fashion Design &amp; Product Development**: The school is the 13th best fashion program in the world according to Business of Fashion London. It is also named No1 in Long Term Value and No5 for best learning experience. They have an annual runway show, and you get to take international trips for college credit. Now I take an interest in this program because I want to create a comfortable, affordable, yet stylish line of clothing for plus-size people. I am plus-size and have been throughout my life. The reason why I want to create comfortable, affordable, and stylish clothes is because for me in school clothes were extremely plain and dull. When I found an outfit that fit my fashion tastes, it was too small. And when I found a plus-size version of it (online) it was too expensive. 

The last two are kind of one in the same... **Psychology &amp; Human Development:** they are two different programs at the school, but they are overall the same. Except, Human Development works with the Education students at the Elementary School on campus. Since I was 7, I had an intense passion for the inner working of the mind. I was also the kid in the background just observing how people acted. This may be closer to Sociology, but I wanted to know why people acted the way they acted. I didn't care much for how they interacted with each other, not as much as I wanted to pick their brain for anything that could cause a certain behavior based off of past experience or etc.

I just started college in the U.S. and everything is good.
However, after noticing the perception people have of my school in the  area, I'm slightly worried that I might not get a job after graduating. I'm a good student and feel capable of getting really good grades and doing extra stuff (such as good internships) to be competitive in the job market. 
I do not absolutely NEED to find work in the U.S. - I am not going to stay here illegally, for example, if I can't find a good job. But I would like to stay here because of social/cultural factors primarily. 
Anyway, my school is in the low 100s in the USNews best university ranking, and it is public and large. 
I'm going to major in Economics and possibly Management Information Systems as well. 
What are my chances of getting a good job as an international student? Will many schools automatically rule me out since my school is not very prestigious AND I'm an international student?

I have been thinking of transferring to a public school in the low 60s in the same ranking or even more prestigious schools such as UVA, a UC or Mich. However, I'm liking it here so I would only make the extra effort if going to one of those schools would help me get a job more easily after graduating. Private and prestigious schools are simply too expensive for me at 70,000$/year and most don't offer financial aid to international students as transfers. Yale and Harvard do, but I'm guessing my chances of getting into either are minimal.

501,danniro,1439967330,/r/college/comments/3hjyuf/thinking_of_returning_to_the_school_i_transferred/,"Sorry this is so long!

I attended my original school for all of one semester. Here is what I will say about it:

1) 1st day, found out my dorm neighbor was a girl with whom I had a unpleasant experience with freshman year of high school and had hoped to never see again (she transferred high schools after frosh year)

2) got into a long distance relationship shortly before starting college. This meant that throughout the semester I was constantly holding myself back out of fear that I wouldn't be a good girlfriend if I drank a bit at a party or whatever

3) for some reason very soon after I arrived I started to feeling this crushing sadness, depression, idk. I felt very antisocial. I've never felt like that in my life and I'm still not sure what caused it, I sort of suspect my relationship didn't help though because I missed my boyfriend and felt even farther from him at school then at home for some reason. Oh but also I had started birth control a couple months prior and switched right after getting to uni. That could've been an influence on my emotions...

4) roommate was nice, but extremely social and made me feel like even more of a recluse

5) but I MADE FRIENDS. With two people in my writing class, hung out with one of them a good deal. there were other people in that class too who I might've gotten to know had I stayed but I kinda pushed them away because I decided to transfer at the end of October

6) I loved the independence. Loved it. Even though I was otherwise unhappy I really enjoyed being able to do whatever I wanted on the weekends, stay out as late as I want, etc.

7) In hindsight, I'm not sure why I left. I've regretted it almost ever since I came back. When people ask me why I left i say ""it was too cliquey, wasn't the right fit""... come on, me. You would've been fine.

Current school:  in my home town

1) I live at home. Yay, 30 minute bus ride. Yay controlling parents who will make it extremely difficult to have any sort of normal social life OR a relationship.

2) I feel very disconnected from campus. I go to class, maybe workout, then I leave. I hardly talk to people. I've met nice people in my classes but only made like one friend, and she is busy so we hardly talk to get together. And it's been 5 semesters.

3) I miss independence.

4) I worry I'll look back on these years and think I missed out on the college ""experience"" or just having fun and idk, growing up as a young adult

The problems are:

1) I'm already behind schedule because I didn't pick a major until my sophomore year. But from what I've seen I've already completed all or most of my original school's general education requirements whereas I have like 6 more classes I need to take for my current school's.

2) I'm pretty sure my parents will be very against it. My mom didn't really want me to leave in the first place because it's is a better school and she didn't think I gave it a chance. I just asked them a couple weeks ago if I could move out and they shot me down, so I'm sure they'd accuse me of just wanting to move out.

3) Original school would be a bit more expensive.

4) I don't know how well my credits will transfer or apply to a 
major at the original school, but I'm going to talk to an academic counselor there Friday. 

You may ask why my parents have so much say in this, well, when I first started college my parents told me ""you don't want student loans, we'll use a private loan"". So they got a loan with a good interest rate and that's how I'll be paying. It's in their name but for me. So they still have say over what I can do. And unfortunately my parents' retirement money was mistaken by FAFSA for spare funds so I get no aid.

Not being in Greek or an Athlete I guess I just generally felt like a loser while I was there. I didn't know how to make any friends and just felt like I wasn't cool enough to be apart of anything with anyone or was just too shy to branch out. I issolated myself for this reason so when I was confused in my courses I had no one in my classes/social circle to lean on and just sunk. 

I'm worried about all of this but at the same time I have recovered from my depression and my heart has been re-ignited with love for education and I realize I want to finish what I started (and possibly even go on to get a graduates). Other schools are not really an option because of how specific transferring credits are; by going somewhere else I'll essentially have to retake courses I already have at this school in order to get the same degree, and it will be much easier to get re-applied for enrollment here than it would be to try to get accepted somewhere else with my shaky academic record. 

The major is Geology by the way, though I'm thinking of changing it to Geography or Environmental Science. I kind of wrote this in one running thought so hopefully it's formatted well enough to get what I'm saying. I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has a comeback story with college? How did you get past difficulties you may have faced and finished your education?

**Edit**: I might as well say, the personal issue I suffered was a break up. I had been going out with the girl for the previous 3 1/2 years, so during my freshman year of College I neglected making friends because I had her, but when it was over I had nothing, and the break-up itself really sent me into a dark place. Shortly after my grandfather died. These things just made it easy for me to allow my academics to slip since I felt so lost as a person.

507,herejust4this,1438221101,/r/college/comments/3f3w0h/denied_pell_grantsfederal_loans_and_could_really/,"I was recently told that I have exceeded my financial aid maximum credit limit for the Pell grants I was receiving. I'm a little bit nervous about what I'm going to do and I could really use some advice. 

Here's some more details of my current situation: 
___________________________________
I'm not sure which information is useful so forgive me if I type too much and please tell me if I need to include anything else. Anyway, here goes. 

I only have 6 more classes I need to take at my community college in order to obtain my associates degree in Java programming in the state of Michigan. After which I planned on transferring to a larger (and more expensive) university which has a transfer agreement with my school to turn my associates degree into a bachelors degree in computer science once I complete the program. 

I have already talked to a counselor about a max credit appeal but unfortunately I was denied it. The reason they said I was denied was because financial aid requires you to complete your degree within 150% of the credit hours required. My current associates degree program consists of 62 credit hours and I was suppose to finish the program within 93 attempted credit hours. I have used 119 of the 93 maximum credit hours allowed for this program. The reason for taking so many classes at my school was I originally went for a certificate program in sound engineering which I finished successfully. After that I took a couple of semesters pursuing a degree in graphic design until I came to my senses and went for the programming/comp.sci. degree.

Because I make so little money I was able to pay for my entire tuition at my school using the Pell grant money I was provided. Now I don't really know what I'm going to do. I haven't had to take out any subsidized/unsubsidized loans but I would definitely be willing to if it came to that. The problem with that is that they won't even let me take out any federal loans because I hit my max credit limit. I had always assumed I would end up taking out loans if my Pell grants became exhausted but I had no idea they would block me from taking out loans.

My grant status on nslds.ed.gov says my Pell lifetime eligibility used is 512.606% (I've read the lifetime limit is 600%, or 12 semesters). The site also says that my total dispersed amount equals $23,232 by the way.

Anyway, here's my questions for everyone. First, will this max credit ineligibility status I currently have be carried over to the university I transfer to, or does it sort of start over/get readjusted for different universities once I transfer? Also, if I absolutely need to start borrowing federal loans how am I suppose to do that if they say I can't because of my current max credit limit? I'm really confused what to do right and could really use some advice.

To start off, I want to say I am undecided on my major, but I have some paths I may be interested in. These include computer science, engineering (I don't know what kind yet, maybe electrical), video game design, and music production. I see myself as a fairly artistic person, but I'm also pretty good with computers and tech.

Around my third trimester of senior year in high school, I was getting ready to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). When all of my friends and girlfriend who planned to go to Chicago for school decided it wasn't the right fit for them, I didn't want to go to the big city alone, so I bailed too (which I'm regretting). I am a Minnesota resident, and I was waitlisted at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities at this time. Seeing that I had been accepted and offered scholarships to every school I applied to so far, I had high hopes of getting admitted. Unfortunately, I wasn't told until July that I did not receive admission. This was heart breaking to me. I felt (and still do) feel confused why I was denied when I know people who were accepted with a worse GPA, same ACT, and less extra extracurricular activities. It felt like I had been betrayed by my state, especially after taking them until July to give me the news.

Ever since I was accepted to the University of St. Thomas (UST), my parents have been pushing and pushing me to go there. I got a scholarship worth over $70,000 for there, it's local, and it's not huge. After sending my only brother off to NYU, these were all appealing factors to them. However, I have been going to Catholic private school since Kindergarden, and the thought of going for any longer sounds horrible to be. There seems to be very little diversity on St. Thomas' campus, and the only programs that are heavily focused on are Catholic studies and business. I have also heard the computer science program is not too bad. UST is also very expensive (even with the $70k scholarship). My parents plan to pay for most of my college education and they say they can afford it, but I have always been extremely conservative with money. It makes me physically ill to spend money on myself where it is not needed.

That is where the big decision comes into play. I was also accepted to Normandale community college with scholarships, and am still allowed to enroll despite classes starting not too long from now. Being community college, Normandale is more diverse and drastically cheaper than UST. It is also only a five minute drive from my home (that's not an exaggeration). That being said, I am worried I will be missing out on the college experience, and that community college will just feel like high school again (I hated high school). I already have my dorm all planned out for UST, and the thought of living alone sounds better than living at home for another year.

Sorry for such a long post and so much background. I am just getting frustrated with all of the pressure my parents are giving me to go to UST, and from my friends and girlfriend not to go there. Advice from strangers in much needed sometimes. I know I can always transfer, and I plan to go to UMN or somewhere in Chicago after a year or two. I just want the beginning of college not to be a drag for me.

Thank you for reading and for any help in advance. It is beyond appreciated.

EDIT: Or would it be best just to take a gap year and explore my options some more?

EDIT 2: I forgot to mention I know A TON of people going to UST. I'm not too sure if this is good or not because very few of them I see on a regular basis.

 I do have my own room. It comes with a full sized bed, a desk, a dresser, and closet. The big things I would like to bring are my two lamps and a chair. I can buy some more things but nothing too expensive. 

Also, What are ways to help keep my classes and class work organized?  Binders, folders, backpacks, pencil cases... I'm open to any suggestions. Thanks in advance (:",college,College organizational help?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3c8fay/college_organizational_help/,1436150416.0

I got a late start on school unfortunately (Fall 2014 was my first semester). In December of this year my parents' health insurance will be dropping me because I'm turning 26. 
I'm studying to be a lab tech and my program is very intense and hardly leaves time for work. I tried to keep my waitressing job but had to quit during the spring because I started to fail my classes. I told them I could only work weekends so they made sure I was there all weekend, every weekend, open to close and most of my tests were falling on Mondays. And because almost all of my coworkers were also in college, getting shifts picked up was nearly impossible. Now I just tutor kids in elementary school for a few hours a week.
Now I'm worried about what I'm going to do when December rolls around and I have to add paying for health insurance to the rest of my bills I can barely afford. 
I've tried to get some quotes and the few companies I've talked to say it's too soon to give an accurate quote but that I can expect to pay around $200-$300/month for a $50 copay, generic meds, and $5000 deductible for major things like hospital visits. And if I want better coverage, my monthly payments will be even higher. That kind of sucks. 
Are there any types of special health insurance plans for people in college that aren't insanely expensive and provide decent coverage?

I'm currently applying to Boston university as a transfer and am not guaranteed to get in as a transfer student. That means I'm going need to have other options as a backup. The only other 2 that come to mind are Massachusetts college of art, and Emerson. Emerson was too expensive for me at the time which is why it was out of the picture and I'm sure it will be the same now. And as for Mass Art I was really unimpressed by the film department from the tour I received back in 2013, but you guys seemed to like that school so it isn't totally out of question.

I'm hoping this doesn't come across as a humble-brag because it absolutely is not intended to be.  I'm currently 24 and a graduate student.  I tried taking some time off to work professionally but wound up enrolling in graduate school 6 months later out of boredom with my free time.  I'm currently a half-time student, full time employee.  Two years from now, I expect to have:

* B.S. Computer Science
* M.S. Technology Management
* M.B.A.
* 4 years professional experience

My interests are split about evenly between actually writing code and managing software projects.  The niche I'm trying to fill with these degrees is to bridge the gaps between developers that don't understand management, and managers that don't understand development.

OK, that's enough background.  This week I had somewhat of an impulse thought: I would love to enhance my B.S. by getting an M.S. of Computer Science.  In fact, my current employer would even pay in full for me to attend since it relates to my work.  Who could say no to a free degree?  The problem is that this would leave me with three Masters degrees.  They're all complementary fields, but I'm worried that future employers will throw my application away for being overqualified and therefore ""expensive to hire.""  Two graduate degrees might already be pushing it.

**Questions:**

* Am I looking at education the wrong way?
* Is 3 graduate degrees too many even if they're complementary?
* Would it be appropriate to go for a PhD in Computer Science instead?
* Would a PhD overshadow the two M.S. degrees or will it complement them?

Well, I was definitely not the kid in class that sat at the front and got along with everyone, I was the kid that got bullied and sat at the back of the class (I was bullied for a few years in school mainly because I have a hearing aid and a lisp, I'm not sad about it I've accepted it, but damn not many people have accepted it lol what can ya do about it tbh?) I got through school with OK grades, I have a very hard time studying which makes me scared to even attempt college. I took my senior year of high school online just because I skipped and walked out of school a lot to the point where I have missed a total of 40 days by March. I should probably also mention I had to stay back in kindergarten so I'm a year older than the kids in my year, but regardless, I graduated in November of last year at the age of 18 (I still laugh to this day because I remember all the kids and teachers that hated me said I would never get out of high school if I keep skipping and here I am graduated before any of them) It has been 6 months since I've graduated and 2 months ago my mom and I moved to Florida, I really hate it here I'm hoping in a year when our apartment lease is up we can move to Tennessee, my mom also does not like the heat, we only moved here because my mom was going to share an apartment with her friend, but in a series of unfortunate events, her friend ended up moving back to New York, leaving us stuck in summer land :/ since then I've been looking into college, here's where the point of this reddit post comes in. I don't know what I want to do for college I have made a series of choices and although I've been racking my brain trying to pick an option, I figured what better way to understand college life than to ask fellow college students/graduates :) I have 3 options so far: 1. Go to college in Tennessee: When we move next year, pretty simple, I'm not going to go into much detail on this option because I'm not currently thinking about this option too much, I figured if I do this and spend all this money on college, I really want to live my life to the fullest in college but also not push it too far and be way out of my comfort zone. I should also mention I have no idea what I want to go to college for, however, I am good at English and Literature, I've always had good grades on that subject 100% my best class hands down. 2. Go to university in the UK: now I know what you're thinking ""Emily that's fucking crazy you need a visa and shit to stay in the UK"" yeayeayea :/ I'm aware, but I also read that going to college overseas can be less expensive, plus the grading system and just the way things work in general overseas is different from american education. Out of all my options, this is the one I keep coming back to, I don't really have a strong bond with my family so going overseas would not kill me, plus like I said earlier I want to live my life to the fullest and make something of myself. I really hope I find people on here that have made the switch from being in America, to going overseas and experiencing university elsewhere. 3. Going to Japan: I've been looking into this too and I think wherever I go to college I eventually want to take a semester in Japan and just learn about the culture, I know quite a few youtubers who are living in japan and speak English and Japanese and it looks interesting there I've always had a connection with Japan ever since I was little, I know this is going to sound typical but I got into Japan by reading Manga and watching Anime.

519,stratman22,1430192600,/r/college/comments/3444zu/ucsb_debt_free_or_wisconsin_business_program/,"So I only have a few days (May 1st) to decide where I am going to college. I am a direct admit to Kelly School of Business at Indiana University and a direct admit to the honors business program at Leeds School of Business at CU Boulder, but I am really deciding between UCSB and Wisconsin. I am a California resident, so I pay in-state tuition at UCSB. I am planning on studying business and potentially going into investment banking and I would like to live in NYC after college, so that factors in as well. 

The case for University of Wisconsin-Madison: 
I just have a great feeling when I step on campus. I feel like it's where I belong. I love the people there and the city of Madison. They have a pretty good business school, and from what I understand landing a job in NYC in investment banking is very possible. Also, since I'm from California, this means I get to go away from home and experience something new. 

Cons for Wisco
-cold in summer
-much more expensive-I'd have to take out between 20k and 45k in loans paid over 20 years, which would suck. 
-my parents and I will have to make sacrifices
-traveling home would be more difficult

The case for UCSB: 
The biggest reason (and really the only reason it's still in the conversation) for UCSB is the fact that I would graduate debt free and my family would not have to make much of a sacrifice. Also, amazing climate and location right near the beach. I get to keep my car, too, which is nice. It's also raked slightly (7 spots) higher by US News and World Report, although to be honest that doesn't mean much to me. 

Cons:
-no business school, I would have to major in accounting and economics and take substitute classes to try to partially replicate a business major. 
-coming from LA, it kind of feels very similar to what I'm experiencing at home. 
-I feel like since it's so close, I'm not truly on my own and I won't grow as much. 
-weaker alumni connections in business than Wisco
-much harder to land a job in NYC
-I've heard the quarter system (3 semesters a year) can be pretty challenging, and if I go to UCSB I will likely consider transferring so it's important to keep my grades as high as possible. 
-I just don't have the same passion for UCSB that I have for Wisco in terms of how much I love the campus, and (ironically) how at home I feel there. 

If money were no issue, I would go to Wisco, but I don't want to make life hard on my parents after all they've done for me, and I don't want to be drowning in debt for the next 20 years. Should I give up Wisco, the school I love with the resources to help me get into the career I want to pursue for UCSB, still a great school, one that I will graduate from with no debt, but it will make it more difficult for me to pursue the career of my choice and live where I want to live post-grad (also I just don't love the school). 

TL;DR: Should I choose UCSB to graduate debt free and make it easier on my parents, or should I go to UW-Madison because it's where my heart is and its business school will allow me to take classes I'm more interested in and apply to my preferred career better? 

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any of your thoughts for me to consider. I'm hoping that just by writing this out, my thoughts will become more clear.

After figuring out what I would do, I decided to take the Community College route. I am kinda scared about this though, and it's for one particular reason: transferring.

To start off, I want to talk about how I narrowed down this decision. I was accepted to the University of Delaware and NJIT's engineering schools. Rutgers accepted me to their pre-engineering program at Newark, which means that I will be taking classes at RU-N and NJIT for a year or two and then transfer to Rutgers-New Brunswick. The University of Maryland: College Park admitted me for the spring as undecided.

I narrowed my choices between Rutgers and Community College. NJIT's program is good, however Rutgers has a more theoretical approach and the name gets me to many places, all while being chepaer. UMD and UDel were too expensive for me :/

I will not have a problem transferring to any schools in my state, New Jersey. There are only 4 schools inside NJ I can transfer to that offer a degree in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering: Rutgers, NJIT, Rowan, and TCNJ. Rutgers and NJIT will guarantee me admission as a Junior if I get a 3.0.

However I wanted to see if I can get out of the state and see other options. I want to see if I can transfer to UDel or UMD, and apply to many more schools. My CC has admitted me to an honors program, and I might end up getting a full merit scholarship. After seeing things at Rutgers that I did not like (mostly from administration), I felt that it would be better if I went somewhere else.

If anyone has transfered from a community college to a school outside of our state, please let me know so I can get some advice on the actual process. I am really concerned about this transition, and my parents do not want me to stay for more than 4 years to get my bachelors degree. I am stuck in an odd situation, so I want to prepare myself for what will happen.

I've been accepted into the engineering programs at Purdue, Georgia Tech, UF, Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, and Rice, and I hope to major in computer engineering.  I have ~120k in my college fund and I get no aid anywhere except Purdue, where I got a 16k per year merit scholarship.  This basically puts me at 0 debt for UF (in-state), 0 for Purdue, ~60k at Georgia Tech, and ~120k for the other schools.  I threw out the three expensive schools because despite them all being fantastic schools, their advantages over the cheaper options don't justify the price.  I've basically narrowed my options to Purdue and Georgia Tech, as I think those offer the best opportunities for their respective prices.

Overall, I personally liked Georgia Tech more when I toured.  I've always wanted to live in a city, and Georgia Tech is in the heart of Atlanta.  It's also relatively close to home and has a much friendlier climate.  The campus is absolutely beautiful, and I love the modernistic vibe I get from their buildings.  It also seems like Georgia Tech has a more highly regarded computer program, so I would probably have more career opportunities.  Tech also has a more developed co-op/internship program, which I'm extremely interested in.  From what I've gathered, it seems Tech students are also on the geekier side, and I feel like I would fit in better.  Not to mention the fact that my best friend is going there, so I'd already know one person.  The whole school just feels right to me.

But that's not to say I don't love Purdue as well.  I've been accepted to Purdue's honors college (still waiting to hear from Georgia Tech on that), so I'm guaranteed housing in Shreve hall for my freshman year and the brand new hall my sophomore year.  If review sites can be trusted, Purdue has better dorms and food.  It also has happier students (again, if review sites can be trusted).  Even though I've survived four years of IB and I'm not afraid to work hard, I do somewhat fear The Shaft at Tech... I think I would have a bit more free time at Purdue, but honestly the difficulty of the engineering programs are probably about the same.  A big plus for Purdue is their absolutely amazing performing arts programs, especially their phenomenal marching band.  Band and choir are my primary extracurricular interests, and Purdue is better for that.  However, Georgia Tech's music programs seem extremely fun and they're probably a bit less of a time commitment.

I'm really looking for a chance to get the college experience and have fun while also being prepared to become an innovator in computer technology.  The male to female ratio at Georgia Tech does concern me, but since it's in Atlanta with Georgia State and Emory right around the corner, I'm not too worried about the dating scene.  Overall I think both schools would offer a great college experience, and I'll have a great time no matter where I go.

I definitely prefer Georgia Tech over Purdue.  Location, expected fit, opportunities, climate, everything just feels right about it.  But, is this step up worth the price gap?  Purdue's still an absolutely amazing school with its own benefits.  I've been attempting to reason out this decision for a week now since I toured Purdue, and I've tried everything from pro/con lists to quantifiable ranking systems.  Georgia Tech always comes out a little bit ahead, even with price considered, but I just feel like I would be an idiot to reject the amazing offer Purdue has given me.

Hi. I am a high school senior hoping to study Mechanical or Civil engineering (although Mechanical seems more than likely) and work in the aerospace industry. I have narrowed down my choices for college to two schools. Here it goes.

First is Rutgers University... or so it may be it.

I was accepted to the pre-engineering program at Newark. I will have to study there for a year or two and then transfer to New Brunswick. I got rejected from SOE and SAS in New Brunswick. I lose the connections I will make the first year in SOE and will have to make up many classes once I get into SOE. I will be commuting all four years too.

Oddly enough, the University of Delaware was MORE than glad to accept me (Civil) and with a decent $4,500/year merit scholarship. I feel that this school best fits my needs, however I can't afford it at the moment. My parents have an unpredictable source of income so it might go from 60k one year to 28k. This year, they got an EFC of 0 which means that we will get a max amount of aid. I am one of two kids in my family that will start college next year, with another sibling who will enter university in two years time.

My parents fear about the income affecting my FAFSA. I tell them about tax credits, scholarships (got one for $1k already) internships, co-ops, and work-study that can help levy the costs of the price to study. Also, I intend to work in the public sector as an engineer for NASA, which will allow me to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Being first gen and Latino, it is difficult for us to take out a loan as we have many fears about what we will gain from this.

I've discussed this matter with my principal, who has been along the ride with me since he came into my school sophomore year. After further reviewing the matter and possible reasons for why I wasn't admitted to the School of Engineering at Rutgers University, he believed that taking out the loan and going to UDel would be the best option. I have also talked with many people, some saying to go where the money is, but others saying the loan is worth the hassle of not transferring.

I have also been told to consider community college, however there is simply no use in this as my options **will** stay the same and I will be able to afford in state universities next year as well. I was also accepted to NJIT, however I have felt that it was not a good option whatsoever that didn't met my needs and offers less aid than Rutgers, while being slightly expensive.

I am stuck in this loophole where my parents don't understand any of the options and are going where it is cheap. While the cheapest route looks good, it might hold a large mess of problems. If I were admitted to SOE, I would have accepted the offer over UD immediately, however I was put in this awful position and must face the consequences. Being 17 until September, my parents can still do whatever they want, but I still need to help them understand what is going on and guide them to a good solution. I hope to bring my principal and parents together for a chat about this, but I need more information to tell my parents about what these choices involve. Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

525,[deleted],1428384180,/r/college/comments/31pu9i/two_choices_and_none_of_them_are_good/,"Hi. I am a high school senior hoping to study Mechanical or Civil engineering (although Mechanical seems more than likely) and I have narrowed down my choices for college to two schools. Here it goes.

First is Rutgers University... or so it may be it.

I was accepted to the pre-engineering program at Newark. I will have to study there for a year or two and then transfer to New Brunswick. I got rejected from SOE and SAS in New Brunswick. I lose the connections I will make the first year in SOE and will have to make up many classes once I get into SOE. I will be commuting all four years too.

Oddly enough, the University of Delaware was MORE than glad to accept me (Civil) and with a decent $4,500/year merit scholarship. I feel that this school best fits my needs, however I can't afford it at the moment. My parents have an unpredictable source of income so it might go from 60k one year to 28k. This year, they got an EFC of 0 which means that we will get a max amount of aid. I am one of two kids in my family that will start college next year, with another sibling who will enter university in two years time.

My parents fear about the income affecting my FAFSA. I tell them about tax credits, scholarships (got one for $1k already) internships, co-ops, and work-study that can help levy the costs of the price to study.

526,Pippen1984,1428336618,/r/college/comments/31n295/10_questions_you_should_ask_every_recruiter_you/,"As a bit of background, I used to work in the university system as a teaching assistant, recruiter and administrator. I frequently had face-to-face interaction with prospective students. Invariably, I'd get questions about the required G.P.A., what test scores they were looking for, etc. Fair enough. I do think, though, prospective students need more information, and they're not getting it. Here are 10 questions I think you should be asking: 


*1: ""When was the curriculum last overhauled/updated?"" 


This should be priority #1. Most people think that universities are on the vanguard of their field. Truth is, except for a few programs, they are usually really out-of-date. Even top-tier schools. Since most of the non-professional schools have no need to keep-up with market trends, or employment statistics, they rely on a curriculum designed decades ago. Some were re-designed in the 1970s and 80s, some in the 1990s and some a recent as this year. Just because they have a course on andriod app development, or social media marketing doesn't mean the program is all that up to date. Find out. If they don't know, get them to find-out. 


*2: ""Who primarily teaches required courses?"" 


Increasingly, required courses (or ""core modules"") are being taught by graduate students and adjunct faculty. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, schools who are overly reliant on them as a source of instruction are often doing so because their full-time, tenured faculty are teaching at a reduced frequency. This can mean that valuable classes in a teacher's area of expertise are being taught by someone else. This can reduce the quality of your over-all education. 


*3: ""What kind of additional services do you offer your students? I'm thinking of counseling (academic), career planning, engagement/involvement.""


Many schools post banners for student politics, but are they engaged? Governments (State, Federal, Provincial, etc) often have throngs of summer internships, as do major corporations, NGOs, health care organizations, etc. Most people don't know how to access these resources. Your school should be actively involved in this. Most aren't heavily involved and students can go for 3 or even 4 years before finding-out about these options and how you can benefit!


*4: ""What are your meals plans like and what do they cost?"" 


Who cares about meal plans?! Well, many (if not most) university cafeterias are out-sourced to companies like Sodexo and Aramark. They can charge anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 a semester for a meal plan. Now, what they term ""meal"" is a combination of food items priced at restaurant levels. The issue is that they usually don't offer comprehensive, well-balanced meals and focus rather on quick-prep items like burgers, fries and pre-made salads. Its often hard to find food that isn't extremely unhealthy, and since the cafeterias usually have reduced operating hours during holidays and weekends, people usually end-up eating garbage. The ""Freshman 15"" is often a direct consequence of a very rapid, and very poor, dietary change. If your school is offering an expensive meal plan, I recommend ensuring that you have alternative options. What's near the campus that you can use to augment your diet?


*5: ""Can I design my own major?"" 

Many, if not most colleges and universities, have that option. Often called ""Self-designed major"" or ""Special Individualized Program,"" students (usually outside of STEM) can elect to design a major of their own. It requires you maintain a specific GPA and meet very regularly with academic counselors, but can be an excellent option for those motivated enough. If you have a specific interest or goal, this may be the way for you to go. 


*6: ""What kind of campus medical services do you offer? Are they 24 hours?"" 


A big problem, not just for women, or for freshman, or people in very intense programs, or at-risk LGBT-Q students is mental health. Often, universities offer very rudimentary services. If you're very anxious, depressed or not feeling well, you need to see someone. What services do they offer? Is it referral-based? Do campus health insurance schemes cover their costs? Schools that offer an M.A. candidate from their clinical psych program often use this to cut costs and frequently don't run the gamut of (what I would call) necessary services.  Additionally, most students begin to regularly engage in sex, including oral, vaginal and anal. While it's tempting to push fate, a lot of people need more than just luck. Condoms, the pill, lubricant and some advice. Make sure the sexual health department isn't a bunch of students manning an office trying to tell you about sex (which, they've usually never engaged in.). Either an RN or an MD! Make sure they have decent services. 


*7: ""How are accommodations decided upon?""

People often ask what the accommodations are like, but not usually how they have a roommate decided for them. One of the single most stressful problems is a bad roommate. Often, people don't mesh, or they haven't lived on their own long enough to know how to be a functional individual. What you should do is find-out if you can move mid-semester and how they decide upon roommates. If it's a random draw, be leery. That's usually code for an accommodations team that isn't very active/engaged. 


*8: ""Who patrols the campus and how do you report campus-related crime?"" 

Even with the Clinton-signed amendment in the US and crime reporting in Canada, campus crime reporting varies widely and is not necessarily a great barometer of the campus environment. Often, the campus security is loathe to deal with petty crime, or aggressive students. A recruiter is giving you a song-and-dance about their ""community"", but read their crime statistics. If they seem incredibly low, be dubious. Many of these universities (often with 15,000 to 20,000 students plus faculty and staff) and have a crime rate that's 1/100th of a city of its size? Always get those statistics. If they seem too good to be true: they are.


*9: ""What kind of learning support do you offer?"" 


This is important for more people than we may think. As an example, I had a student who had a common learning disability. Her mother was getting stone-walled wherever she called and so I ended-up getting her. She didn't know what services existed, because no one had told them. Even if you don't have a learning disability, why not know? Many times people have to take classes like calculus or advanced chemistry and it may require getting some help. Yes, there can be student tutors, or there may be more comprehensive help. It's better to know how to access the resources *before* you need the help. I would also recommend if there are professional services, that they should be your first stop. 


*10: ""I want to be a (fill in goals here) and want to study (program). Is this a good idea?"" 

Ask. Ask. Ask. Many career counselors at the school can guide you. So, you want to be a doctor. Pre-med, right? WRONG. Lawyer. Pre-Law? WRONG. Much of what people think are great tracks to their goals are a mistake. Do you think that universities haven't seen ten thousand other political science graduates with a minor in Latin applying to law school? Don't do something because it may get you where you want to go. Figure-out where you want to go and how you can make it there. A great option for medicine may be Anthropology with a minor in health sciences (for instance). Maybe Russian &amp; Economics for law. There are lots of options. You have to figure-out what interests you and how you can best do it. Don't do something you may dislike because you think it's the best option. Because, it's usually the worst.

527,postamer12,1427789941,/r/college/comments/30wlqa/please_help_me_decide/,"Hey Reddit!

I am currently in a predicament and was hoping you guys could help me out. Let me start by telling you about myself. I am currently a international student in an international school in my final year - IB exams in a month!! Anyway so a few months ago I was rushed into applying for my universities as I was not planning to apply to the USA (wanted to do medicine earlier from AUS). But after intensive research I realized that the medical path in the USA wasn't very practical for an international student and with such a short time left to apply to the unis I had to take a quick decision to changing my major to something I seemed enjoyable- computer science. So yes since this was in mid December, I must add that I had missed the UC schools and UIUC to apply too. Anyway I ended up applying to a list of unis with my predicted IB score of 33 and sat score of 1800.

The decisions I have now received are the ones below. However now I am unsure as to what I should choose:
Boston University- great overall rank, expensive however. CS program is only decent. However option to choose a variety of decently ranked majors. Good job prospect??

Penn State- University Park - Overall rank not far away from boston, cheaper, CS program is average wouldn't say out of the world, has a good business school rep and large uni allows for option to choose a good range of decently ranked majors. 

Virginia Tech- overall rank not very high, good tech school for recruiting, decently priced, good food, cs program is above average

Purdue-Main Campus- not very high overall rank, great cs program, high recruitment opportunities.

So i don't exactly know what to choose anymore. I have never done cs before and have no prior knowledge of any sort in the subject at all and wouldn't rate my math skills out of the world. But at this point in time I have no idea what other major to do...i have worked a little with computer automation (bots etc..) and enjoyed that but thats about it. 

So yeah, If its only for cs then I think my research tell me purdue would be the best option correct? But since im unsure about the major would it be a better option to go to a school like penn perhaps where they have a good scope to try out other majors which have some recognition..i feel like purdue may be too engineering oriented??

Also could someone let me know how the transfer process works. My predicted IB grade was quite low due to me falling sick during those exams and not being able to perform. But i am confident that in my finals I should be able to get something alot higher around 36-37 atleast so also keep that in mind when recommending a uni choice please. For example if you suggest penn and think that transferring into a more focused uni for that major with a better rank is an option. then let me know. I know transfers are not so easy and so would like a uni where i'd have a good career in the future if i graduated from here. 

Also if  you are a current student or are in the same situation please message me would love to get to know things about the CS programs and things like that :) ",college,Please Help Me Decide!,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/30wlqa/please_help_me_decide/,1427807941.0

* University of Alaska Anchorage
* Binghamton University, State University of New York
* Framingham State University

**Good reputation.** I want to go into the Civil Service and ultimately the Foreign Office, so a university that has a good reputation is important. I am not a party animal and I am very focused on my studies, therefore a university that has stellar academics and isn't known as a party school is what I want.

*Location*

**In an interesting location.** I don't mind a rural campus, providing there is a notable city an hour or so away. Public transportation to other big cities is a plus as is a city with its own bus service. A unique culture to experience would be nice opposed to going to California or the East Coast tourist hotspots where all my friends want to go.

**Not an expensive place to live.** I can't afford California or any notoriously expensive big U.S. city but can afford other cities listed.

**Near a major airport.** Makes travel easier and flight times shorter. Cost effective too.

*Social*

**Student body isn't obsessed with sports and are more academic than athletic.** I like soccer but I can't see myself getting taken up by the whole school spirit stuff. My U.K. university does an annual sports day with lots of school spirit and it wasn't my thing.

**Dating scene isn't a massive orgy.** I know some colleges have a reputation for STDs and random sex. Not me at all.

I applied to eight universities and as of now have been accepted into 4(CSULA, CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, UC riverside). 

I don't want to put any faith in colleges that haven't accepted me, so those are my options. The issue is price range. My mother(single parent) makes 90k a year, but we have lots of bills to pay, debt from her law firm that didn't work out too well, and various household expenses. Because of her income, I have been notified after turning in my FAFSA(on time, btw) that I am not eligible for a cal grant entitlement award. That's all fine, I saw it coming, but college is expensive as heck. You should also note that I'm pretty much your average white boy - mixed Caucasian descent, born and raised in California. My parents are military vets, my mom is a lawyer, my dad is a substitute teacher. 

What I'm mainly looking at is between UCR and CSU long beach. 

UCR would total around 34k(I can shave some off because I can get ahold of textbooks easy, but not much) per year.

CSULB would total 24k(again, I can probably save a little here but not much)

Solution seems obvious, less money = better, but UCR has done their magic and made me fall in love with the school. I got in to the BCOE, I love the campus, and I think I'd really like it there over all else. Problem is I don't think I can pull the extra 12k out of my ass. Oh, forgot to mention - I accepted a non-binding $2000 scholarship from UCR, which would help lower the burden a bit. 

**My questions:**

Should I push myself towards UCR? 

If so, how much money do you think I could make working (most likely) minimum wage in the summer? 

Where should I go to find extra financial aid? All the scholarships I find online seem pretty impacted. 

Should I expect anything from my FAFSA, given my background?

My average is an 83 (edit: College Board converts it to 3.0 GPA) (I have 90+ grades in math/physics classes but I got very lazy in English and ss, I failed chorus and french because I couldn't drop them and I didn't show up most of the time). 

I am not a very good test taker. My standardized test scores are not very good. First, I took the ACT and everything went wrong. There was no clock in the testing room and my proctor would not give us a 2 or 1 minute heads up to change sections. I got very nervous and started guessing the majority of the test that was left. I am ashamed of getting a 17 as a composite score. This makes me feel very stupid. My score was not sent to any schools so I won't worry too much about it.

So I took the SAT (with a watch this time, learning from that bad experience from the ACT). I left maybe 20% of the questions blank in certain sections at most so I would not lose points for wrong answers. I just got my scores back today and I got a 1010 CR+M (2013 exact average on CB) and 1470/2400 (27 points below 2013 average).

When I gave it in as a college essay draft for my English class I got a 97 on it. My professor told me that it was the best essay in the class.

I also had to write an essay about an experience I had with engineering for a CUNY school. My piece showed that I was passionate about problem solving, with the example of me figuring out a CS50 problem set. My friend who got accepted into Julliard read it and he told me it was very good, along with several other English teachers.

Here are the colleges I am applying to:
-City College
-New Paltz
-SUNY Polytechnic IT

I am certain that I want to study Electrical Engineering (not a tech major, a standard engineering major). Are there any other schools in NY that have decent engineering programs that are not too expensive?
I am just really worried that I won't get into any schools, I really want to start in Fall.

If I do get rejected by every school, I know it is not the end of the world. I don't want to go to community college and transfer though. Would it be better if I just kept myself busy with something during the Fall then? I am open to trying out for the Air Force, but at a certain point I would like to obtain an engineering degree. I know I am capable of doing well in engineering and I am unsure of what is going to happen when I get letters from colleges in the Spring.

I was recently accepted to Harvard EA for the class of 2019. While Harvard is my top choice school, it is VERY expensive. I live in the Pacific North West, and airfare/tuition/room/board would come out to about 63,000 a year.
Harvard touts that it is very generous with its financial aid so i was optimistic that I could attend relatively affordably, But today I received the letter that predicted Harvard's financial aid and if i were to matriculate, I would receive a whopping 4,800 dollars in scholarship. Now i don't want to sound whiny, but that is still 58,000 dollars that my family is spending per year, a HUGE amount of money.


 I also applied to Whitman college and UW (University of Washington). These are both great schools, with Whitman in the town where I live, and UW a great university that has a tuition of around 25k. Whitman is right around as expensive as Harvard, but i have contacted their financial aid offices, and due to my ACT/ the fact that I have been taking classes at Whitman (economics/philosophy) since i was a sophomore (am currently in junior level classes) i would be offered a scholarship for around 16k, and could possibly even go up to 25k.


First Question: Reddit, in your opinion (i understand that in the end it will be my choice, but I am very interested as to what y'all have to say) is it worth it to skip the name recognition, networking and caliber of education I would receive at Harvard for a large tuition drop, while still attending excellent schools?


My family is nowhere near poverty, but we are also decidedly not rich. The thing is is that my parents are incredibly smart with how much money they spend/save, we live in a relatively small house, but they have a very large 401k, and a lot of money saved, which put us at the very very bottom of Harvard's mid-high bracket that gets much less financial aid.


I absolutely abhor the idea of cutting into my parents retirement, but i also don't want to graduate with enough debt to quite literally buy a very nice home.


So Reddit, how can I drag my college education to the lowest amount possible. Anything and everything you guys can think of would help. Scholarships, grants, low interest loans, drug running into Canada, ANYTHING.

I mean, I have all this space all of a sudden so I'm trying to figure out my options.

So far I thought that I can turn it into a party room which will boost my social life although it's quite expensive (initially) and I might not be as serious at school. That or I could rearrange it and go to some other guys room for fun.

What do you guys think?

It's too expensive, academics are shit, I've yet to make any real connections with people, and as a bio major, they have a science department equivalent to my high school. I need to leave. 

My options are: I can rush my transfer process now and leave before spring. I need to do all the paperwork and such, and pay all the late fees since this semester is already over. In that case, I would try to go to a local community college for the spring, then transfer to another school with the program I want, for fall 2015. It's way less expensive, I'm in the process of figuring out how financial aid would work, and I would cut the loan my parents took out in half. One year where I am is 30k for me, compared to 1-2k tuition at the community college(1 semester), and reduced instate tuition for the school I want to transfer to in fall 2015. I could always take a semester off, as well- I would look for a job, read, volunteer, etc. But my parents would rather me go to school. Or, I could stick it out for this one semester, reduce all of that stress and risk, finish my program for one last semester happily knowing Ill be leaving soon. The question of credits transferring also comes up - there is another risk that none of the credits I've taken, or can take at the community college and at the school i'm in, will even transfer to the 3rd and final school I want to attend. 

What should I do? Does transferring twice reflect poorly of me? Is reducing stress and risk really worth another 15k? In talking to my parents, they are iffy on deciding on anything at this moment because of the stress and risk involved. All of this is very sudden and overwhelming right now.

Before I went to school, I thought I would enjoy an urban campus, but now I feel like I would prefer a more traditional campus setting. I also think I would prefer a liberal arts school, rather than such a huge research university.

There are a lot of schools I would prefer (ones in warmer climates, for instance), but the schools I prefer aren't necessary the ones I can afford. I also have already settled in here--I have an apartment, a job, etc.--and I'm not sure if it's worth even trying to transfer, or if I should just stick it out for the lsat 2.5 years at my school.

Transferring itself seems daunting--it looks like a lot of different requirements--letters of recommendation, transcripts, etc. 

I'm also worried about money. The college I attend is already too expensive for me, and I already have loans. A lot of the schools I feel I may be happier at are more expensive than the school I attend now. I feel like I can't find a school that is affordable and also has the attributes I want in a college.

I had a terrible guidance counselor in high school, and I'm a first-generation student, so I feel I lacked the guidance to make a better choice for where to attend my freshman year, and now I'm suffering the consequences.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm really not happy, but I feel like I'm stuck here. Is there anywhere I can go or someone I can talk to about the transfer process?

I love learning and college don't get me wrong! I'm doing well in all my classes, and I like what I am studying (Computer Science)...however I am just not liking the life part. I've been involved in a few clubs with my department, and that's about all of my social interaction. A lot of the time if nothing is going on with my clubs or I don't have work to do, I go home for the weekend. I mean, yeah I could make more of it and all but I am starting to realize I just don't want to. I've always been a homebody and I thought getting out and going to college would change me...but its just made me kind of depressed.     


So I have two options...

A. Transfer to a local commuter school, 1 hour commute but my brother and I were talking about getting an apartment close by since he works in the same city the school is in and wants to move out.    
B. Transfer/drop out to a community college first and finish up my gen eds, then transfer to the commuter school.   

Currently I spend around $22k a year, the commuter school would be around $12k a year, and CC is what $4k a year? The second option, financially makes a lot more sense. I have about a semester or two worth of gen ed type courses I need to get rid of...however I think my family won't take too kind to this option because CC is for ""failures""...my dad always said ""Well if you don't do well enough in high school maybe you could hack it at HACC""..HACC is the local CC. I'll most likely work while doing it, to save money, and I feel like overall I would be happier to be back at home with friends and family then trying to fit in somewhere at this University.  

What are your thoughts on this?  

**TL;DR** Should I stick it out at this current University even though I'm not really happy, and if not should I transfer to a more expensive commuter school or do my gen eds at a CC while working...but live with the stigma from my family?",college,Transferring from a University to a CC?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2m0v8p/transferring_from_a_university_to_a_cc/,1415771263.0
540,imawesumm,1412823186,/r/college/comments/2iq47i/resume_building_while_living_off_campus/,"Hey, all.  Never posted on this sub before but you guys seem like a supportive group of people to talk to about college related things.  I'm at a relatively expensive out of state school as a freshman this semester, obviously living on campus.  The reason I chose this school was because my intended major isn't offered anywhere in my home state (Wisconsin).  However, I've decided at this point I intend to switch majors.  I'll be going home next semester to either work or take some community college classes, haven't decided that yet.  I'll definitely be back in school next fall though.

I'm considering staying at home in general next year or maybe even for all four years.  I really, really haven't been enjoying living on campus.  Dorm life is terrible, and a lot of the socialization aspects of college have turned out to be a lot harder than I thought they'd be (especially being this far from home) and really not to my liking.  The thing that concerns me, though, is resume building.  You know, extracurriculars, clubs, all that good stuff.  With living off campus and commuting, I probably wouldn't be too able to get involved with clubs on campus.

I really feel like I shouldn't be at my school, or any university at all. I mean, I know I need to go to college (I'm studying international relations and have no intentions of changing that), so dropping out isn't an option. Besides, I can't afford to drop out, as I worked so hard to get here, and have a huge scholarship + financial aid package. It would actually be more expensive for me to go to community college and live at home. (I also come from an abusive household, so going back home would also be really dangerous.)

544,[deleted],1407349826,/r/college/comments/2ct5wi/the_myth_of_a_college_education/,"Here's some background:  25F, degrees obtained:  BS/MA, total student loan debt:  ~100K, monthly income now: ~1800.  When I was growing up, not going to college wasn't an option.  The school drilled it into our heads that we had to go to college or else we would end up old, alone, and living in a van under a bridge.  In addition to the school drilling it into my head, my parents always taught me that going to college was the only way and the means to a brighter future.  My parents did not even go to college so they didn't know any better.  It's just what universities have been drilling in people's heads over and over for years now.  So anyway, when I was of age, I attended college at a local university.  When I entered, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.  After changing my major about a million times I finally settled down on psychology b/c I was naturally good at it (not like it's hard anyway) and I enjoyed studying it.  I chose to focus on neuropsychology b/c I thought the brain was fascinating and I loved biology.  While going through school, I also got the full ""college experience"" aka drinking every night and partying (glad I now owe $100k for that...) whilst keeping a 3.8/4 grade pt average.  For those of you who don't know much about psychology, you pretty much need a Masters or a Ph.D to do anything with it.  Hence, why I got a Masters.  

Here I sit now, a 100k in debt with a neuropsychology assistant position and only earning about $2,000 a month (you need a Ph. D. to be a neuropsychologist).  Here is what I learned from going to college:

1.  A diploma is piece of paper that is too damn expensive--100k to get a damn piece of paper is ridiculous.  Some say ""oh, but an education is priceless.""  I agree an education is very important, but which venue you choose to get that education from decides the price of that education.  Literally, everything I learned in college I could have read out of books or elsewhere on my own time for a lot less money.  Mind you, nearly everything I learned in college is forgotten.  However, jobs don't care if you have all the knowledge in the world about that field, they care about the initials behind you name because apparently how you learned that education is more important.  Additionally, paying that much money for a bleak future and lost time is equivalent to rape.  There is no guarantee that you will become employed.  What happens to your student loans if you have to declare bankruptcy?  NOTHING.  You still have to pay for them.  Student loans are entirely too easy to get and being able to afford school without them is impossible.  Who would give a $30,000 loan/year to an 18 year old, fresh out of high school, without knowing anything else about them?  Oh, the government and private student loan companies.  Why?  This is because they know that they have these KIDS locked down for 30 years into this debt plus interest that they can never escape.  Debt=slavery. The cost of college is absurd and rising.  People see universities as this good natured, omnibenevolent organization for the people, but in reality, a university is a business.  They are trying to make money just like every other business. 

2.  College should be for fine arts, not the sciences.  There should be separate schools for medical degrees, dental degrees, pharmacy degrees, engineering degrees, etc.  The separate schools could offer a more focused course load rather than making you take an IS course such as math and politics or a women's studies course.  These courses offer nothing to student or the field of study.  Paying $800+ for a course that will in no way benefit you, yet is required in order for you to do what you want is the fine print of a bad business negotiation.  Moreover, if you can pass the licensure test for a job, you should be able to work in that job without a college degree.  For example, for engineering, you have to take the FE AND have a college degree in order to become an engineer.  Same thing to become a counselor.  You have to have a master's, but you also have to pass licensure.  Now, if all the information you really need to know for that job is on that licensure test, shouldn't you just be able to get the title with passing that test without the additional requirement of a college degree?  It's a scam and the universities are just raking in the money.  

3.  A college degree is equivalent to getting through Jr. High.  College just isn't as prestigious as it once might have been.  A college degree actually used to mean something, where now-a-days, every joe shmo has one.  Universities let anyone and everyone into college now and the people who graduate are just a dumb as they were when they entered college.  IQ scores are traveling downward and now universities are teaching what others should have learned in high school or even Jr. high.  If universities want their degree to mean something, they need to be cut throat.  First, don't let everyone in.  Getting in should be competitive just like a Ph. D or Master's program.  Second, FAIL people regularly if they do not meet the standards of the course.  For example, there was a girl in one of my courses who clearly should not have passed the course.  She handed papers in late (when the syllabus said no late papers) or didn't hand them in at all.  The professor still passed the girl probably because she didn't want to ""hurt her feelings.""  By her passing this girl that didn't do the work, the professor just shit all over my degree.  It's worth nothing.  It is saying that you can get that piece of paper without doing any work.  Greeeat. Glad I'm literally paying for a piece of paper rather than earning it....     

4.  The ""college experience"" is a joke--The ""college experience"" amounts to drinking and partying with your friends.  What did that teach me?  That I'm an idiot for paying that much money in order to get it.  People always rave about how college was the best days of their life.  Sorry, but I don't believe that paying 100K in order to drink with my friends were the best days of my life nor is it necessary.  I think I can drink with my friends on my own time with my own money.  This idea of an experience has become so engrained in people's minds that they feel that have to go to college to party.  News alert-you don't.  News alert-if you really want to drink at college, you can without being a student.....mind blown.  People say ""the college experience is about opening up your mind and gaining new experiences.""  Read some goddamned books for once and ""open up your eyes"" yourself to different view points.  Critical thinking skills are of the utmost importance and you're never going to get them if you just rely on a professor telling you what to think and how things are.  This selling of a ""college experience"" is just another way to rope in people to spend thousands of dollars, and I bought it.  How pathetic.

So if you are beginning to think about college, think about your options.
1. you could go to college, owe thousands of dollars, get out when you are 24+, and still not have a job
2.  you could go to trade school, owe less money, get out at 19 or so, and have a better chance of getting a job
3.  you could learn a skill on your own time, start at any age (16+), owe nothing, and be building your own business while others are wasting their life in college
4.  you could start a career in a business (such as McDonalds), start at age 16, owe nothing, and be working your way up the ladder so that you are already making more than them college folk by the time they get their degree.

Speak with your pockets.  If you are just giving universities money to go to college even though you know it's all a scam/joke you are giving them the power and things will never change.  If their enrollment begins to drop, prices of education will go down and they will start listening to what people really want.  If only I knew all of this before I went to college.

rant over.

Im really in a stressful conflict right now between me and my parents with this whole college process. Im currently a junior in high school so looking at colleges to apply for is the main topic pretty much this year. My parents know this too. I already know what i want to major in: Fine arts/studio arts , cuz im extremely good at drawing, painting, etc. Im familiar with a  number of schools that provide an art  program and shit. But i dont wanna go to a school thats all based on art. I wanna go to a university that provides a number of majors so i can interact with people with other interests besides art so i wouldnt be having to talk about art all day everyday day. My life doesnt revolve around art. Im familiar with other stuff as well. My mom on the other hand keeps telling me about colleges for me that i dont wanna go to or dont have an interest in. And these colleges are all art based colleges and thats exactly what i dont want. I told her why i dont like the idea and she seemed ok with it, but days later she keeps shoving them down my throat like she didnt hear me. So im really getting stressed about this shit and worried that my parents are gunna end up picking out schools im gunna apply to and decide my college for me and shit. 

Now later they go to another level and sign me up for a pre-college program at Carnegie Mellon University over the summer without even talking to me first about it like wtf. I told them i didnt wanna do it because the thing is 6 weeks over the summer which takes up a month more than half my summer. This starts a really heated argument. Since im coming out of my junior year which is honestly the worst/stressful months of my life i wanted to relax this whole summer and not do shit. But my parents are keeping me on my toes shoving this shit down my throat. So this argument goes on for hours. My parents are EXTREMELY hardheaded and narrowminded. I told them i wanna relax for the summer but they call me lazy -__-. I tell them iv never been more stressed in my entire life and they joke about it and tell me that theyre stressed too cuz their adults and shit -__-. The program means i have to stay there for 6 weeks without going home. I miss 4th of July and i might miss a family vacation which im bummed about. But they dont give a fuck. I applied for the program and got a scholarship. Everyone is happy for me except me. 

 They start pressuring me with colleges i dont like, but i dont say anything about it. They think their gunna force me to apply to colleges im not interested in. I told them already of the colleges im interested in and they say ok at first but then they keep shoving these down my throat despite my opinion. I thought since im the one going to college, im the one to choose what i wanna do with my life. Not them. They dont even care about my fuckin opinion about what i want to do with my life. I ask them angrily like ""Doesnt my opinion matter? Isnt it my life?"" and they tell me straight up ""No"". i couldnt believe what they said. Its my fuckin life and i go where i wanna fuckin go and do whatever i want with my future. They say their doing whats 'best for me' but they dont realize that i know whats best with my life as well. 

All my life teachers and other people tell me that IM the one to choose where i wanna go, And to choose wisely what college i wanna apply to and shit like that. MEE. Not my fuckin parents. Their so controlling and overbearing. I told them in the argument that my guidance counselor (male) keeps telling me to ignore what anyone says and do what you wanna do with your life and where youll be the happiest. And their ignorant ass dad says ""Well you tell him that i said no, thats not the way it goes."" -____- . Fucking seriously? They think that since their paying for it that means i have no say in my life whatsoever and my opinion doesnt matter. Shit, their opinion shouldnt matter alot. They think im still a fuckin baby and i cant think for myself and think they can make decisions for me like im their dog instead of their son. My dad always talks to me about when hes gunna die id be nothing and ill have to care of my responsibilities and make adult decisions. He tells me to take care of myself right now like hes already dead and grow the fuck up. College decison-making and applications are the first step of growing up and making adult decisons and hes not even fuckin letting me!!!!!!! such hypocrites. 

Now heres whats pissing me off. I research schools im interested in all the time and look up what their campus is like and the social scene is and shit like that. But I never paid attention the tuition price. Now my parents have been in a financial problem lately and cant pay for much and buy much than they used to with my brother and his school. I know that since my parents are paying for my college i gotta watch out for tuition prices. I cant ignore their financial concerns. My older brother went to RPI for engineering. RPI's tuition is 45,000. My parents paid 45,000 which im sure is pretty expensive for a school. (correct me if im wrong). And im sure they arent able. So i looked up the tuitions for each of my schools i was already interested in:

Syracuse University - $36,300
Quinnipiac University - $38,000
Pace University - $36,000
Temple University - $23,000
Radford University - $20,000
West Virginia University - $19,000

Yes. Radford and WVU are 20,000 and 19,000 believe it or not. Now the colleges that my mom are pressuring me into are in the fuckin $40,000 - $45,000 zone!!! Even Carnegie Mellon is 43,000 like wtf are they even doing?? I dont even think theyre even checking the tuition prices at all. And some of them require at least a 2000 on my SATs and around a 3.8 GPA which im SURE i cannot achieve. With the schools im looking at i might actually have a decent chance besides the one my moms looking at for me.

Freshman year, incredibly small school district in the country, not a lot offered and we lived far from the school. I tried for various theater things 4 times, I only ever made stagehand or understudy, which is fine with me, but my mom is, well, stuck up and an ass, and said she wouldn't drive me to practices unless I made ""an actual part"". 

Also tried out for color guard, was extremely sick audition day dizzy with a fever, didn't even go to school but went to the tryouts anyways... I passed out. So I didn't make it in, obviously.

Was going to join the quizbowl, but no one would ever tell me what days meets were on no matter how much I asked, and so I just gave up because it was apparent they didn't want me there anyways.

Besides band, which you had to join in the 6th grade (didn't live there then) to be in, those were all the extracurriculars they offered. 

Then we moved over to where we are now because my dad got a great, and *permanent*, job offer (great because he normally worked contracts that lasted 1-3 years). Due to housing issues related to loan problems and the government shutdown, we didn't get the house here until October. Well, my siblings, mom, and dad lived in a trailer park so my siblings could start school there since our house had already sold, while I stayed at my grandparents in a different state, where I started online school, because it was the easiest thing at the time, rather than giving them custody and me enrolling there, it would have been a huge pain and yeah. 

So I've been doing this online private school this year, and obviously there's no such thing as ""extracurriculars"" in it. I have been learning a Japanese in my free time however, but I don't know if that counts... I've asked several times if I could join some form of martial arts or singing lessons or something, but it's always ""it's too expensive"" and ""I don't like driving anywhere you can do shit when you get a license"" (which I'm doing driver's ed in the summertime).

So I'm starting the public school here next year for my junior year, haven't had the chances to do any extracurricular beforehand. I plan on joining choir, drama club if it doesn't overlap with choir, as well as anything else I can fit in. 

Will it look bad to colleges that I didn't do anything outside of classes my freshman and sophomore year?

550,[deleted],1395966084,/r/college/comments/21jx24/i_want_your_opinions/,"I currently attend Villanova as a freshman but am trying to decide whether or not to transfer. I have already been accepted and I plan to visit the campus again soon. I want your opinions just to offer me a new perspective and maybe bring forth issues I had not considered. 

Here's my pro and con list for each school:

Villanova: Pros- 
Not overwhelmingly large, strong alumni association, tons of internship opportunities, helpful faculty, great location, basketball, decent parties, good networking opportunities for the east coast, well-ranked, helpful advising, confident I will graduate in 4 years with either a job or plans for a post-graduate education, never had a class larger than 35 people, Philly is close but not too close, 3 years of housing,

Cons: Everyone is the same which can be uninspiring, strict core curriculum that bars me from exploring classes I might be interested in taking, expensive (although I don't have to pay, I feel like i owe my mom the cheapest option), social scene can seem dead, food basically consists of 9 different kinds of pasta everyday, strict policies on drinking and drugs (currently on disciplinary probation), surrounding township police hate Villanova and bust parties on the reg, campus feels isolated, far from home, a lot of the buildings are stuck in the 80s, business students get all the benefits, a lot of people haven't heard of Villanova outside the east coast (unless we're doing well in bball), sometimes people seem stuck-up or fake, no one really notable comes from nova. They all just end up rich.

Umich:
Pros- closer to home, Ann Arbor is great, vibrant campus, all different kinds of people, cheaper (I can go one year free), football, option to live stream classes from my room, larger alumni network, more flexibility to explore majors, more exciting social scene/more parties, more lenient campus security/police/RAs/policy in terms of drugs and alcohol, really great people have come out of here, midwestern charm/friendliness, some of my good friends go here, beautiful campus that's well-integrated into the area, great opportunities, well-ranked and well-known university, numerous food options, was my top choice before I was waitlisted,

Cons: Large school makes it hard to get good advising, alumni association might not be very strong, nearest big city is Detroit, lower 4 year graduation rate, possibility I will be unemployed, hard to get yourself out there/stand out, very competitive in some areas, crazy class registration, some classes taught by TAs, potential to be overwhelmed, more graduate focused


So basically, what are your thoughts? I should add that the isolation of Villanova has played a large role in my desire to transfer because it really gets me down. I'm normally pretty social but I've found myself getting really anxious and turning inward unless I'm drunk.

I am pursuing an Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) degree and need to choose a school that's 1. affordable (cost to benefit ratio) and 2. has a lot of opportunities to get involved. I am also strongly leaning towards a BS/MS type of school for M.E.

My current choices and reasons for going / not going to them are:

1. University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) - I visited them and enjoyed everything except the fact that the campus is packed (especially when there are football games going on) and there is little opportunity to stand out amongst the 50000 other students. (And also, I may not be able to get in to the M.E. program with my 3.5 GPA)

2. University of Illinois (Chicago) - I visited them and personally don't like the campus. There are little opportunities for internships and to network (from what others told me). There is also usually very little to do on-campus.

3. University of Wisconsin (Madison) - Nice campus, but expensive to attend. Also, I'm not sure if I can get in with my GPA.

4. University of Minnesota - I have not visited them yet, but I've been told it's a good school. The only thing that I don't really like is that some of my courses - particularly Statics and Dynamics - will not transfer, also I would be paying out-of-state tuition for them.

5. Purdue - Visited them, campus looked awesome, but it is an expensive school to go to (especially for out-of-state students). Not sure if I can get in.

6. Ohio State University - My one friend goes there and she really likes the school. I'm turned off by the fact that it's expensive and far away from home (in case anything ever happens and I need to come back). 

There are my 6 schools but I also considered University of Iowa, Iowa State, University of Colorado, and SIU - Carbondale. For me, money is the biggest concern, but if I can get into the BS/MS for M.E. program then money is not an issue (because I can finish the degree faster and to me finishing faster is more important than price). Location is not too much of an issue for me, but I do prefer a campus that is in a ""good"" area (not much violence/crime and so forth).

I took the tution cost from the state university I attend and worked through the math.  Assuming a person takes the typical class load (15 credits a semester at our school), and they pay in-state tuition, each class (not credit, we're not too expensive) will cost about $1200.  Divide that out by the number of meetings per semester and it comes out to $26.

You spend $26 for every hour session in class.  Comparatively speaking, that's about the price of 3 full movies (or 1 if you get popcorn and drinks).  So, you basically throw away $26 every time you skip class (sometimes even if you go to class, sadly.)

To me, this means a few things.  First, we need educators who make that time worth $26.  Next, we need to pay them respectively - think about it.  A twenty person class pays $520 for an hour of instruction.  A professor is lucky to see a twentieth of that.  Perhaps if pay reflected effort, professors would make you want to come to class!

I graduate in 1 month anyway, if Reddit doesn't prevent me. Double major in math. It's been a rough 4 years to say the least. I got into some trouble freshman year and got kicked out of my dorm/school, quickly transferred right after the incident to a better school and dominated my sophomore and junior years. School was cake. Now, however, I'm plagued by even the thought of getting started and I wait til the last minute to start. I'm producing crap but still passing ±0.25 of the std. dev. so I'm not too worried, just tired of school. Honestly, at times, I feel embarrassed to be doing so well and trying so little. 

I've gotten some full-time offers but have yet to accept anything. Some offers are too far but pay well (80k) while others are close and pay average (60k). I want a lot of stuff so naturally the more the better. Living at home could save me ~12-16k/year but what fun is that. However, in terms for student loan debt, from what I estimate, I have more than the average student ~$46.5k but I've already paid ~$8.5k so I really have ~$38k left. I received tons of need/merit based aid too, went to public school, and took 4 AP courses in high school. It's retarded expensive to go to college, even if you do everything right like me ;)

Car has been having problems recently and I just found out I need to pay another 2k for the Fall semester since I dropped a class because of laziness and bc I didn't need it for anything, just an elective to reach full-time (12 credits). I lost a 2k scholarship that was already credited to my account since I dropped to 9 credits. Bullshit is that shit. Pretty mad about dat doe.

Thinking about buying a GTI too. Wicked awesome little cars. Have yet to test drive one but looking forward. That, or a 2013 audi/bmw Just can't wait til school is over and I get started at my job, save vigorously a few months (12-24), pay off all my loans &amp; get a nice ride to replace the POS granny-mobile 02 toyota solara I've been rocking the past ~4 years. Hopefully a nice car will impress easy-to-get girls. If not, I can still appreciate the german engineering....

Went to high school. Through high school I wanted do be an architect or something along the lines of that. All four years I took architecture related courses and decided near the middle of my senior year that I really didn't want to do it. Sadly, this didn't leave me much to work with.

Went to a small, commuter only branch of a state school (UNH Manchester). It was a decent price, although New Hampshire state schools are ungodly expensive compared to most. I decided to just go for business. After a year I decided I wasn't crazy about it, but I was going to stick with it. While registering for classes for my sophomore year, I was not able to create a schedule that would work with all of my classes. Commuter school = 3 of my required classes ended up being at the same time on the same day late at night.

So I never went back there. Decided I wanted to do something else and was pushed to follow my dream. Applied for an art school in Boston for photography and got accepted and even granted some scholarships. Still, I would be paying $25k out of pocket every year and was not willing to take student loans on something that would probably end up paying $20k a year. So - dream crushed.

Decided I NEED to go back to school either way. Looked into a community college in my state (NHTI) that I actually liked the atmosphere of. While trying to decide my major, I learned about radiation therapy from my bosses wife. It sounded pretty decent - relatively in demand, the field is active where I want to live (Boston), the pay is excellent, and it sure as hell beats a cubicle job. It was too late for me to apply for the program, so I took the suggested route and went into the general studies program.

Well, yesterday I had orientation. The head of the general studies program broke the news to me that to get into the radiation therapy program you need to fulfill a bunch of requirements based on points from classes taken. She told me that only 1% of applicants made it (thanks for telling me in the first place NHTI!)...so I don't have a chance of getting in next year. So I'm essentially looking at going to community college for FOUR years for this - and that is at the least. There is always a chance I don't get in on my SECOND application and I have wasted two years and two years tuition on nothing.

So I pretty much have no clue on what to do here. I'm almost 21 and I pretty much have nothing in store for me. I honestly can't take four more years (if not more) of living at home in New Hampshire. I don't have the money to move out and go to school on my own, I don't have the training to get a good job to do that, and I can't afford to go away to school anywhere that won't drive me nuts since room and board is so expensive. Should I just go back for business and complete that?

I hope someone can give me an idea.",college,At a crossroads here - what the hell do I do?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xmou3/at_a_crossroads_here_what_the_hell_do_i_do/,1344034217.0

I got accepted, and i knew going in that I would get accepted. I applied only because of how cheap it is, its about 19,000$ a year with everything included. I figured it's a little bit better than a Community College basically.




To the point though, I was wondering if anyone has ever heard of someone or did this themselves -- Had not the greatest grades/SAT scores throughout high school. Went to college for a year or two, but transferred to a really good school after getting amazing grades while they were at college.




For me, While at high school i had a 3.1 overall and a 1590 SAT (with writing). So my grades aren't amazing. I wanted to get into a college like Connecticut College, Lehigh, Brown, Upenn, or Lafayette. My high school grades weren't good enough/the schools are too expensive anyways.



TL;DR Can I go from having a 3.1 overall high school GPA, enter a college where I get amazing grades for a year or two at most, and get accepted into a very good school after transferring?",college,Possible to transfer from a bad school to a some-what prestigious school?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/svv0h/possible_to_transfer_from_a_bad_school_to_a/,1335578176.0

Having been an art student briefly a few years back, schools such as Columbia, SAIC, and Indiana University - Bloomington have been suggested. However, SAIC is FAR too expensive for my liking (I also don't think they offer what I'm looking for), and I just don't know how I would go about determining which would be the better school for the program I want. Any information/advice is greatly appreciated!",college,Good universities for graphic design in Indiana/around or in Chicago?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l8pt1/good_universities_for_graphic_design_in/,1318384152.0
