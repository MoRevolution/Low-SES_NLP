I've just been avoiding them and purposely going for meals when I knew they wouldn't be there. Yesterday I stayed in my dorm all day looking out my high window wanting to jump. The counseling service here is kind of a mess- I have a ton of classes since I'm a music Major so I can't find times to meet with the counselor. Plus my insurance is a mess since I'm in a difficult place with my parents. Can't afford out of pocket, obviously.

1,whoopsielovetunnel,1661118015,/r/college/comments/wub3u9/i_dont_leave_the_building_when_fire_alarms_go_off/,"The fire alarms in my dorms building have gone off twice a week, every week, for two years. Sometimes at 3AM, sometimes in the middle of the day. Upperclassmen and alumni alike who lived in my building have told me that it was a problem when they lived here too, meaning these alarms have been going off twice a week every week for over five years, long before I got here. And since the dorm was built, there has never once been an actual fire. Clearly, they're not working correctly. They're set off by steam from showers (there are detectors inside the bathrooms so there's nothing us students can do to change it), they're set off by aerosol cleaning sprays, they'd probably go off if you breathed warm breath on them. It takes absolutely nothing to set them off, and while I'm sure some of the incidents have been from people smoking or burning candles they weren't supposed to have, that's not the majority of it. Some people I know have taken to just smoking under their beds with blankets boxing them in, so it's not like the alarms are actually stopping anyone from smoking. It's just making them sneakier.

As a result of this, I no longer leave the building when the alarms go off. I jump out of my skin because it startles me so bad, and then I put on my noise-cancelling headphones that my mom got me for my anxiety a few years ago. Then I just continue doing whatever I was doing before until they finish throwing their tantrum.

I have sent numerous emails and service requests to my school's housing department trying to get them to fix or replace the damn things, but they have done absolutely nothing beyond blaming the students for the frequency of the alarms. At the end of the semester last year, I saw less than thirty people leaving the building every time the alarms went off (my building houses over three hundred people). I actually complained about it so much that the housing department put a section about it in the monthly newsletter last year, basically making excuses and blaming us for every single point that I made in my emails. I almost didn't come back to the dorms this year because it's so bad. The only reason I did is because it's basically my only option. I can't afford an apartment and my dad's house is too far away to afford driving to and from class five days a week. If I had any other option I would take it. 

So what the hell should I do?",college,I don't leave the building when fire alarms go off,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wub3u9/i_dont_leave_the_building_when_fire_alarms_go_off/,1661136015.0

I'm in a new state, hundreds of miles away from my family and friends. I'm broke, I have no one to hang out with here, and everything has been going downhill for me. 

I'm a part of the college band. I am the only girl in my section, and all of the others treat me as a lesser being. They're always putting me down, telling me I can't do certain things, and they talk over me whenever I speak. I've brought this to the band director's attention and now they won't speak to me. There's lots of tension and I feel unwelcome here, but I can't leave because I have a scholarship and student loans to pay.

One night at practice, I was feeling nauseous and I threw up behind a dumpster. Next day I was taken to urgent care, but couldn't be serviced because they tried charging me $100. My insurance doesn't work in this state so I have to pay for everything out of pocket, which I don't have any money for. I ended up having to go to a local health center, and it turns out I have a UTI. I was prescribed medicine. It took a week to get to me because the local pharmacy was having technical difficulties. I couldn't afford my medicine, the pharmacist offered to cover it for me, and I missed two weeks of practice. 

My roommate hasn't been making this any better either. Every morning I wake up to her alarm, and she sleeps through it. One morning it rang for a full hour, while music was loudly playing, and she slept through it all while I was up, unable to sleep. I tried waking her up but she doesn't budge. She leaves the room messy and she blasts music while I'm trying to sleep. I tried talking to her about this, but she doesn't want to listen to anything I have to say. I reached out to the residency department and they said it's too late for me to switch rooms.


Just today, my suite mates (it's eight people per suite, four dorms per suite, two people per dorm) had made a mess in the suite. They left, and I came back to find the suite messy, with trash everywhere. They had eaten and left all of their drinks and plates there, and a whole cart of trash in the suite. I was sitting in my room, complaining about it to my friends back home, when my roommate (who wasn't there at the time), called and asked me to clean it up for them, by myself. Apparently they had all went on a shopping trip over half an hour away, and it was expected to be cleaned up by the next 20 minutes, or we'd all get fined $150. I called my RA, and apparently she was already aware of the situation, because she asked me who did it, and I said I didn't know. The other suite mates had all said the same thing, so I felt taken aback by this. Eventually they came back and cleaned it, and I had to go for a walk to clear my head because of the anger I felt. I came back from my walk, and they all started to verbally attack me because they felt betrayed by the fact that I didn't clean up after them. 

I'm currently on a tuition payment plan of $500 a month, and my next payment comes up in two days. I am completely broke, and my mother is no help. I've asked for more scholarship money, and there's nothing else that they can give. They advised me to take another loan out, but this loan has to be taken out by my mother, and she is no help.

Any suggestions or even your own lists are welcome.

- First and foremost, I need to get out of my room, dude! I don't have to be a hermit anymore to evade my family. My dorm building is full of opportunities to socialize, especially since it only houses freshmen, and I really gotta take advantage if I'm paying all that money for it. The way the building is structured is that it's a tower with a sort of hangout area in each floor; maybe I could bring my Switch, hook it up to one of the TVs, and invite others to play with me. Or study in that area... anything to not fester in my dorm room.

- Get used to being more open. I'll have a random roommate (luckily, they have a roommate matching system to pair those with common interests/habits) so most privacy is off the table anyway, but I just gotta be more interesting. I do a lot of cool things - art, animation, creative writing, all of that on top of majoring in CS - and I'm not usually expressive about these. Since I have nothing to hide anymore (overbearing family), why not show people the cool stuff I make? This also goes for things like my favorite music artists, animes, etc., many of which I wear on my clothes. I get judged every day at home for these, but once I move out, who's going to really give a damn about what I wear? I could connect with someone through these anyway.

- Be presentable. Nothing crazy, just keep my consistent hygiene habits going, brush my teeth more often, and (this is a little embarrassing to admit but) keep my hands off my face and get my nails growing healthy again after so many months of stress. I've promised myself to start these right after my high school graduation two weeks from now. Quitting is honestly harder for me than it might seem.

- Hit the gym if I can. They have a recreational building with a full gymnasium near my dorm, and if my schedule can fit it in, maybe get a good workout in occasionally. I need to gain muscle weight and not look like a walking skeleton.

- Stop procrastinating. I can't breeze through my schoolwork at the last minute anymore, especially not with a STEM major.

- Know my campus and get involved, take advantage of extra educational opportunities, and find a good work-study program. They all pay the same towards my tuition so it's just a matter of picking what sounds cool.

- Be careful with my spending habits. I can't really afford to throw money out the window as I do already.

My first thought was loans. I don't like them, but most people go to school on loans. But in addition to tuition and supplies, I still need $1,000 to $1,200 a month in cash. Federal student loans only go as high as $12,000 a year, and that's only for seniors. I wouldn't even know where to find a lender who would allow me to take out enough money. Furthermore, from what I understand, borrowing more money than that over 4 years of schooling just isn't done. That's an insane amount of debt that no one takes on. It would never be paid off in my lifetime even if I could take out that much.

So people say ""Go to community college, it'll save you money."" That's the plan for the first two years.

16,Alviv1945,1608238906,/r/college/comments/kf66lo/uni_changed_roommate_rules_between_semesters_help/,"Hey Reddit!  
This issue is a bit on the strange side, and it's not a direct issue with my roommate, but moreso the school and last-minute changes involving roommates. It takes some explanation but I will add a TL:DR at the bottom.  
Note that this is for a university in the state of Washington (but I won't list the specific school as I'm not sure what the consequences would be).  
Currently a Freshman. 

**Background:**  
Early July I was in a car accident that had me in a boot for five months. I couldn't walk properly and needed a lot of help getting around and accessing things. I also have pretty severe anxiety. At the same time, my roommate has some mental health issues that are better handled when not alone. As of our application for the Fall Semester, the school was allowing some exceptions for roommates, however, most people were placed into single dorms due to COVID. We both agreed that not having a roommate or someone around would be detrimental to our health, and accepted the terms that should either of us get COVID, we would both quarantine. We also either dined in the provided spaces in the dining hall or in our rooms to prevent further spread. If we hung out with friends outside of our dorms, we took all precautions not to get each other sick (which was good, because I'm immunocompromised). We only ever visited our dorm supervisor and one other friend a couple of floors down, but even then it was 6ft/2m away in the hall. Neither of us got COVID for the entirety of the semester, and our campus peaked at 14 (I think) cases for the entire semester despite plenty of parties taking place on other floors (none of which we attended).  


My roommate is genuinely awesome too. Personal issues aside, we'd figured out a cleaning schedule for the room within 3 days, and became very dependent on each other. We both have issues remembering to eat/sleep/take care of ourselves, but we can take advantage of that fun anxiety loophole where we feel the urge to remind the other to do those things. We have an established schedule where I leave to go study in the library/shower during her therapy sessions, and we both watch our fav show on Thursdays on the TV. On top of that, we share a LOT of things, including but not limited to:  
\-TV  
\-Scent diffusers/air fresheners  
\-Nintendo Switch  
\-Humidifier  
\-Curtains  
\-Rug  
\-Clothes drying rack  
\-Mirror  
\-Watering can for plants  
\-Heating pads for ladies week  
\-Microwave splash screen  
\-Cleaning supplies  
\-Trash bags  
\-Milk, cheese, veggies, candy, most leftovers  
\-Study supplies

As of yesterday, my roommate called the housing department to get specifics on how moving back in would work. We had flights back into the state planned for the same day, planned to share an uber/lyft, and help each other with luggage and she wanted to make sure we didn't mess anything up.   
Later she calls me crying upon being told that everyone was now being moved to single dorms upon the Dean's request. The Housing Department doesn't like this decision and is trying to fight it, but if that fight is lost, that puts us (and the few others who have roommates for similar reasons) in a really bad position. One of us will be required to move down the hall, which for either of us includes several lbs of books, sheets, shelving units, clothes, luggage, shoes, and those major shared items that we own (me owning the TV, Curtians, Air Fresheners, Rug, Drying Rack, Cleaning Supplies and most Study Supplies, leaving her needing to purchase those) while I'm still doing intense physical therapy for my leg/foot. On top of that, either one of us frequently forgets keys and tends to sit outside for 30+ minutes out of fear of interrupting a class. I also don't know if either of us can afford a single dorm (if the school is changing rooming prices).  
Oh, and also, my folks won't even let me go back to campus without a roommate. 

I want to be able to have a somewhat normal and healthy college experience. I respect the precautions the school is taking against COVID, but with our previous arrangement, neither of us ever got it and if anything we were better holding each other accountable for both being aware of COVID and for other things- like eating, sleeping, starting class/studying, getting out of our pajamas, etc. This change feels super last minute, as the official email from the school was only sent out today and we had to plan way in advance to afford flights into the state and appointments to get COVID tests within a reasonable time before our arrival. When we signed up to have a roommate, we both signed a roommate agreement and were under the impression that things would remain this way for the entirety of the school year, as we were worried about having to move rooms in the first place. As far as I understand, the CDC isn't requiring or even recommending students to be strictly single dormed anyway... I'm just very confused and shaken up. 

Parents on both ends have tried calling in and were promised calls from housing withing 24 hours (they're all upset as well). No one has called back and it's getting close to the employee's winter break.  


**TL:DR**  
Beginning of school year, roommate and I were one of a few pairs permitted to room together due to COVID. We needed roommates due to physical and mental health issues in which being alone would be detrimental to our health. We were told that we wouldn't have to worry about later changing rooms. We both share 15+ major expensive items and those mental health issues are still prevalent. W  
We agreed to quarantine if one of us got COVID and hold each other responsible for COVID related health precautions. We've both developed a good relationship and depend on each other for a lot, and we feel like the other is the only normalcy we have left. We both had to sign up for appointments for COVID testing and flights back into Washington weeks in advance to afford them/have them at reasonable times.   
As of today, the school has officially stated that all students are being moved into single dorms, despite the state not requiring it. Neither of us can afford that and my own parents will not allow me to return to the school without a roommate. I feel my own mental health would suffer if I went back, and I'd also struggle to move everything to another room with the still persisting injury to my foot.   
Both sets of parents and ourselves have tried contacting the school for specifics or alternatives or at least to put in our two cents. We were promised calls back within 24 hours... and have yet to receive any calls. 

Can the school do this? Is there anywhere in WA law that states they can't, as we've already signed our roommate agreement and were given verbal confirmation that we would not have to move rooms previously?

Been self-isolated since March for fear of being an asymptomatic carrier. I've been hearing that asymptomatic is rare but I honestly have a hard time believing if it's true. 

Back at home we live with my grandma who is older than 65 and my mom has iron deficiency anemia. They're definitely at risk if the virus were to infect them. I'm scared of returning home even just for a visit only for one of them to start coughing. Aside from them being high risk, I really wouldn't look forward to being in the same house as my dad who has completely unmedicated BPD. 

I applied for the CARES Act for the summer. It takes two to three weeks to process. Only thing is I didn't enroll in summer courses cause nothing they offered was part of my degree plan. I've been spending May and June on campus as my job at the library has partially returned to in-person operations. I have no way of knowing if I'll qualify. So I'm considering taking a small private loan that would only be up to $800 to stay on campus for the rest of summer.

With the way the pandemic is going in my state, I can't afford to risk myself or my family. I myself am high risk for being prediabetic and obese. Testing is hard to come by without insurance.

I decided to attend my state uni since it was known to be the most prestigious in the state and it was very much affordable. I managed to get a very very generous financial aid package that covers almost all of my yearly tuition, and since I have a part time work study job, my parents have decided to not worry about paying for my college tuition (except for dorm things). So thankfully, they've not had to worry about it which I'd prefer for it to stay that way. 

Thing is, when I looked at my financial statement in the campus bursa, I saw that there was a charge of ~$711 for tuition which remained after financial aid applied, which I was unaware of the cost till now. I looked it over and realize this might be how it is for the next four years, not even my work study and spending habits could cover the cost each year. The reason I didn't get a loan was because my parents did not allow for it since it builds up interest rates over time according to them, so we decided it would be handled by us (or me in this case). 

And just recently, I've had to drop a course I was inevitably going to fail for the semester which meant I had to pay back ~$800 for dropping it since I'm under a scholarship in-state. And I can't even afford to pay that back right now which means I might be temporarily barred from the scholarship next semester until I pay it back. Even worse, my parents don't know that I had to drop a course and was charged a lot for it. 

I've looked into Boro but they require a 3.0 GPA and I'm only in my first semester so I haven't gotten back my final GPA for fall, and I'm not sure I could even pull a 3.0 since I'm struggling in CS right now. And I'm not sure if University loans would be a good idea due to excess charges and interest. 

Is this a good idea? My parents would not be happy with this but I'm sure I could pay it off quick given the field I'm looking to go into (cybersecurity). I'd like to be able to do this without letting them know and dealing with this on my own if that's possible since I wouldn't want to burden them. If so, I'd estimate about $6000 which I think shouldn't be too bad. Thank you.

I plan on majoring in computer science

Here's my situation: my parents make too much money for me to qualify for any need based assistance from the schools or the government. My parents won't be helping me pay for my tuition either. So I'm basically on my own. 

Now if I go to a commuter public school, I did the math, I'd be able to work a part time job and afford the entire time with no debt. If I do a community college then I'd be able to pay for the two years and have nearly enough money left for a year in the go-away state school. The negatives to this though is that the commuter schools, especially COMMUNITY COLLEGES, are known to have less of a social environment than dorm schools. 

For a little while now, I've been wanting to go away for multiple reasons:

-I'm honestly CANNOT STAND being around to be at home around my mother anymore, I see an onset of mental illness that might worsen her behavior in the coming years and I don't want to be around that

-My high school is so boring and I feel like I've missed out on so many ""high school experiences"" I look at other people's high school and they have fun but NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING, ever goes on in my school.

-I want to be around more of my own race, I feel like such an outcast at my high school (some of you guys may not understand this point but it has really affected my experience a lot)

I feel that after how my four years were at my current high school, I honestly deserve to have a better next four years. Besides that, I truly can't stand my mom and I don't want to feel a certain way at home after I turn 18.

The cons to this though is that I'd probably have to take out a loan and a part time job wouldn't be enough to pay it off before school ends.

I need some honest advice because I'm really stuck on what to do. I'm still 80% leaning towards going away but also still thinking about how beneficial a commuter school would be.

28,unseelielucian,1547247848,/r/college/comments/af175p/stay_or_transfer/,"Background: I'm a junior in apparel design at RISD (rhode island school of design). Long story short, risd sucks. Freshman year was a nightmare (the infamous poop bandit was in my dorm hall on my floor), our bathrooms didn't have heat until March, my professors first semester were raging dicks who taught me absolutely nothing, and I was miserable in general. Halfway through freshman year, I applied and was accepted to FIT (fashion institute of technology, nyc; also applied/was accepted in high school), but then chose not to go for whatever reason. 

Sophomore year was good the first semester but then my depression got awful second semester (I don't know anybody in RI and I had roommate issues so I was miserable) and I got C's in all of my mandatory studios. 

Junior year: I live in a house that's falling apart with two roommates who drive me insane and a partner who lives three hours away (so I rarely get to see him). We got a new professor this semester, and well. he sucks. He refuses to give anybody anything higher than a 79%, excepts a shitton of work for stuff we werent taught (full design, marketing, and promotional portfolios, with manufacturing guidelines) and I failed his class and another studio (both because the workload, and because I got the flu, bronchitis, and stomach flu consecutively in the first 3/4 of the semester which put me hella behind and then my depression/anxiety made it impossible for me to finish my work). The curriculum is not my interest - it's haute couture and mass manufacture design focused, and I'm into costume design, lingerie, and artisinal handcrafting (think bespoke tailors, renaissance faire stuff like catskill mountain boots, son of sandlars, custom fetish wear, etc), and for a career I probably want to go into either patternmaking or machine repair (I'm very good with machines and can repair most standard sewing machines because I did two internships and work as department assistant tech).

So now I'm at a cross roads. My options are: Stay at RISD and tough it out for senior year; take a gap year and apply to FIT; take a gap year and go back to RISD. I can't afford an extra semester at RISD, which would be required if I fail even one more studio. If I applied to FIT I would have to take a gap year since the application deadline for Fall 2019 is already passed, and I would have to do 2-4 years more of school (whether they let me transfer my credits and go straight to bachelors, or if I would have to go into associates first). To be fair, 4 years at FIT is the same price as 1 year at RISD, and renting a studio would be roughly the same cost in either location. My other option would be to take a gap year to save up money so I can afford materials for my senior year without having to work 15 hours a week (which is what I have to do right now if I wanna buy fabric and eat). 

Pros of RISD:
- Very good reputation
- I only have 1.5 years to go
- On paper a good design program
- Good connections
- I like my on campus job

Cons of RISD:
- Location sucks
- I hate it
- No friends
- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
- far from my partner (who makes me happy) and ny ren faire (where I work as a performer every fall)
- Constantly failing classes
- Far-ish from home and any of my support network
- No good fabric or yarn stores (have to either go to NYC or buy stuff online, both not ideal)

Pros of FIT:
- cheap af
- NYC! my favourite city! (I'm from nj)
- lots of friends + much closer to family and partner
- Close to ren faire
- great fabric stores
- 24 hour stores
- not... as cold as ri?
- easy access to jobs, connections, and internships because of location

Cons of FIT:
- Reputation isn't as stellar as risd
- might not accept me since my grades are bad-ish (3.2 gpa, two c's and two f's currently)
- Have to do a gap year
- Don't know the curriculum
- housing in nyc is tricky
- would have to be in college for longer

29,TommySalami69696,1539559924,/r/college/comments/9o7hnd/does_anybody_else_feel_like_their_friend_group/,"I'm a sophomore in college right now, and I feel like I'm in a very weird position. Allow me to explain.

Back in highschool, I was in a number of ""friend groups"", I guess you could say. Freshman year, I had that small core group of friends who didn't really split up right at the beginning who I'd eat lunch with. That group disbanded, and I was alone for a while. Eventually, I found myself in a new friend group my junior / senior year, with a couple of dudes (only one of which I'm still friends with for a long number of reasons), that's done now too. My freshman year of college, I found myself in a new friend group: I made a new friend who I went to HS with by running into him at a lunch hall, I made friends with some people who lived on my dorm hall, I met some people through them, etc. But now, I don't feel like I'm part of any ""friend group"" anymore.

The group that I had from last year is pretty much gone. Some of my old friends had to move far away to live with family because they couldn't afford dorming anymore. One of them (a girl I was pretty close friends with) ended up getting an apartment off campus and now lives with 3 other girls and has pretty much forgotten I exist. Some of them were closer to my ex than they were to me, so they're out of the picture. Some of them left the ""group"" before the year was even over.

Now I still feel like I'm friends with some of these people on an individual basis. I eat breakfast with my friend from HS a few times a week, because we just so happen to be on the same campus at that time of day for classes. I've hung out with one of the other girls who had to move away a few times, but it's rare because of the distance. I don't have any ill will towards any of the people that I don't talk to anymore, they're just living with their new friends and doing their thing, and I just didn't fit in anymore... I guess.

Now I've made a few new friends through classes this year, but I feel like it's becoming more and more apparent just how much I'm not part of a ""group"" anymore. One of my friends (who seemingly has way more connections than me), we'll call him Z, has invited me out to hang out at this person's house party, or this person's apartment kickback, etc, and it's making me realize just how not part of any ""clique"" I am anymore. I tried to make friends with the people that he's gotten involved with recently, and it doesn't seem like they want anything to do with me (they leave my messages on read, say they're busy, don't invite me out to things that I know Z is going to with them, etc.), but he's dating one of the girls in the middle of the whole clique so I figure before long he's just going to get wrapped up more and more with her and her life / friend group (since they'll include him if she wants them to), and less and less with me, because having me around his new group of buds would throw a wrench in the middle of everything if they don't want me around, and there's no way he's going to choose me over pussy and a cohesive social circle of people who are already close... that seems to be the way these things just sort of, happen.

Another friend, we'll call him X, lives with his friends / bandmates and hangs out with me to eat / study sometimes, and we've played video games and drank / smoked together and all that, but I still feel like I'm not part of his ""inner circle"" and I never will be. He's older and he lives on the other side of town, so it's no wonder he's already found his people, it's just weird feeling like when he's brought me around, I'm just the ""kid"" who he knows from here, not actually a member of the unit.

It's a strange feeling. It's like, I know a bunch of these people, I feel like we're all on good terms. I figure if they didn't like me, our relationships wouldn't have gone as far as they have. But when these people bring me to meet the people they know, I always feel like I'm ""the outsider"" since I haven't been there from the beginning, and there's no way I'll ever have that depth that they have with eachother. I tried to break my way into one of these friend groups to no avail, and now I actually feel like I'm losing one of my friends to them. I don't like how it feels like I'm on the outside of everything now. It's not that it's a bad thing that the friendships I have with the few people I still do keep in contact with are based solely on the fact that we get along 1 on 1, but it feels *wrong* in some way that I don't know how to put my finger on. It's like I'm peripheral. I'm always the one trying to make plans, I don't get invited out to much, if anything. Maybe my friends don't do much as it is, but not ever being invited to things makes me feel like I'm just ""tolerated"", or these people hang out with me out of a feeling of obligation or just because they know we have a class together and don't want to make it awkward. I don't want to lose all of my new friends after classes change next semester but I feel like it might happen and I'm worried I'm finally about to have like, 0 close friends.

I still live in the dorms because I work as an RA but it's not the same as freshman year. I feel like I took the job out of this misplaced hope that I could re-create the magic of moving out and living among a group of freshman, but as a sophomore, it gets old real fucking quick living on campus where we can't drink or throw parties, and it's not like the people on my hall view me as a potential friend, more like someone who ""works for them"", and they're not wrong, and I don't blame them. All of the ""groups"" that I've run into this year are all people who decided to move into a house together off campus, and it's made me realize just how key that is to the whole ""having a life"" thing, or at least feeling like you belong somewhere. I've always wanted to, and still plan on moving in with my best friend, but he's in a shitty financial rut right now and he won't be ready to move in with me until at least next year, which is when I'll have to decide to keep this RA job or try something else, and I'm definitely leaning towards getting the fuck out of here.

I know I need to ""put myself out there"" more. I definitely could have done a better job talking to people in my classes at the beginning of the year, but people choose their seats and it becomes ""taboo"" to switch it up and make people move around. I need to look for some interesting clubs that I could meet people in, although that could be a crap shoot (it definitely has been so far, of all of things I've shown up to). I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel like the further I go into my college years, the more and more behind I'm getting in terms of ""finding my people"". By this summer I'll essentially be halfway done, it doesn't even feel real saying that, the time has flown by so fast.

I know it's stupid to compare myself to others, and I should be thankful for the experiences that I have had since I've gotten here. I know that some people never make any friends in college, I'm happy I'm not in that boat. I got with some cool girls for a night here, few weeks there, couple months with one of em'. I had a lot of great experiences so far. I just don't want it to suck shit from here on out because I feel like all of my bridges have either began to fall apart, or have been burnt entirely.

Did any of you guys find your ""real friends"" later in your college career? Do you have any tips for me to get to know people in my classes / community on a deeper level than just acquaintances? How do I ""break into"" a friend group when I find one? How do I stop being ""the initiator"" and get people to invite me out instead?

I've contemplated that maybe I'm just not an exciting person to be around. Who really knows. I figure even if that's the case, it's not like I can change that. I've tried my best to become a ""better person"" - started working out, stopped playing video games, I dress well, the whole nine yards. I had a 4.0 my first two semesters.

Way back in 2013 I dropped out fo high school. This was due to a combination of things, for one, I was homeless at the time, and sleeping on friends couches, but also I have two learning disabilities. The combo of audio processing disorder, and dysgraphia. Meaning that my brain is shit at listening to things, and I have a hard time transferring my thoughts to paper. Thee public school system refused to do much for me, and most accommodations I did get where ignored by instructors. 

in 2015, I got my GED, and started at the community college planning to get a history degree. At this time, I had my own place and was working \~30ish hours a week. After a year I switched to a Computer Science degree. Failed Pre-calc the first time around, and then took it again the next semester and passed with an A. 

This year, I started at a university. I'm a little behind schedule, but no biggie. Most of my classes are going well. But I'm still shit at Math. I can't figure out why. I take as many notes as I can on my laptop, and generally the concepts I have fairly down pat, but there's so much that I just can't for the life of me figure out. I'm failing horribly at this course. Worse, I'm broke, but not ""dorm life so broke haha"". Like I literally am starving myself because I can't afford food, and my power is getting cut off next week if I can't find money to pay it. Worse, in march of this year, I went through some shit and figured out that, contrary to popular belief and despite having a penis, a woman. So that's also seriously eating away at my mental health. I've cancelled my last three therapy appointments because I can't afford them, and my last batch of hormones was $202. I have no support system whatsoever, I work a shit ton, I have a shit ton of homework, I'm trans, but am so cripplingly anxious that despite actively growing tits I can't present female and actually try to pass as cis, which makes me worry that I'm not actually trans, which stresses me out more, and scares the shit out of me. 

TLDR: I suck at math in a field based on math, Gender has no meaning, and I wanna die. ",college,I feel like I'm drowning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9ngrg8/i_feel_like_im_drowning/,1539332273.0
31,aaalbacore,1537068096,/r/college/comments/9g7j2e/how_do_i_decrease_academic_anxiety/,"This is a weirdly personal and super long story to put on reddit, but I'm looking for ways to stop being so stressed about my academic performance. 

I went to a pressure-cooker STEM high school where a large percentage of students make perfect scores on SAT and ACT, are national AP scholars, and go to ivies or ivy equivalents. When I was in high school I pretty much chose my friends by grades; I wanted to surround myself with smart people, but somehow insisted that grades were the only indicator of intelligence. I ended up spending all my time with extremely cocky people. My ""friends"" would berate me if I made a score on an exam that was even slightly lower than theirs, and they came to see me as academically inferior because of the multiple instances where I had difficulty on a topic in a class. 

I started to develop really severe testing anxiety and found myself giving up on studying. I slept the days away and saw a huge decline in my mental health, which my peers and teachers saw as academic weakness. I graduated from that high school with honors, but it felt like an empty victory because my brain was fried by the time I left. 

For some classes, I did fine but just didn't retain any information once it was over; I just wanted to shut it out of my brain. For others, particularly my math courses, I was weak in the subject to start with, and after being berated by my teachers/peers, I spent every day counting to 100 in my head until the class period was over. I've taken four different calculus courses and I still make arithmetic/foundational errors left and right. I just suck at math. 

I got accepted to some fairly prestigious universities and committed to one, but my financial aid application was processed incorrectly and I couldn't afford to attend anymore; I ended up withdrawing from the university two days before I was supposed to move in to my dorm. The only school that was open for registration at that time was a small technical college, which is where I am right now. For the first time in my life, the courses are wildly easy and I have a lot of free time on my hands. All my old ""friends"" ghosted me because they can't be seen with someone at a technical college. 

I got accepted for transfer to Georgia Tech next year. I want to try to fill in the academic gaps, but I also want to feel better about myself and be able to go to class, study, and participate like a normal human being. I want to make the most of the three years I'll have at Georgia Tech, except, I don't even know where to start.

Sorry this isn't the most straightforward ask, but any advice would mean a lot.

32,centipede_soul,1537045653,/r/college/comments/9g4zl6/im_starting_to_get_really_homesick_and_scared/,"I'm currently going to art school only 2 hours away from home, and have been here for three weeks now. At first it went surprisingly smooth. I didn't even cry when my parents left, I adapted really quickly to taking care of myself, and I became friends with my roommates almost immediately. However, things have been getting a lot worse lately.

The first problem is that my roommates have an obsession with boys. They talk excessively about their crushes, and refuse to watch anything that isn't a romcom. Thing is, I'm a lesbian. I didn't think this would be a big deal, I could just casually come out and then comfortably discuss crushes with them. But I kinda get the feeling that one of them is homophobic. She's mentioned before that she'd be uncomfortable with a lesbian seeing her boobs, and has used the word ""gay"" as an insult. I also kinda get the vibe that she already knows I'm a lesbian and is trying to get a rise out of me or something. 

Another issue with this particular roommate is that we agreed that we'd have a ""ghibli movie night"", since she's never seen a ghibli movie. First time we agreed to do it we got through ten minutes of spirited away before she switched to romcoms (which her and her friend watched till 1am). When I said I was a little upset about it, she agreed to do it next week. That never happened. The other roommates haven't been terrible, just don't talk to me much. I have social anxiety and don't talk much either, so they probably just think I don't want to socialize.

Another problem is that there are so many rich kids. I got in mostly on scholarships and loans, so I don't really fit in. My roommates often buy lots of snacks to share, and I feel bad because I can't afford to always buy snacks for everyone. It also seems like fashion is really emphasized, but I only have about 5 outfits and don't wear makeup. 

I also hate the general area. I've always loved nature and forests, so living in the city is not for me. We're advised not to go out at night without a buddy since it's a dangerous area, which means its hard to escape when my roommates are being loud at night. The dorms are overcrowded (four people in a room), and have a sort of hospital smell. 

Overall, I can't shake this feeling of ""coldness"". None of the people who love and understand me are here, and the few people who claim to be my friends seem to outright reject a lot of my interests and aspects of who I am. I also tend to have really vivid dreams, and recently I've been having a lot of nightmares or dreams where I'm back at home. 

Right now I'm trying to find some good friends outside of my dorm and have met a couple people who seem nice. I also have a bit of a crush on one girl. I'm hoping that if I can make some friends who I like more I'll start to feel more at home. Though the homophobic roommate thing has been really bothering me, and I'm really not sure what to do about it.

33,biteszadusto9,1506302074,/r/college/comments/72992t/transferring_in_the_fall_after_freshman_year_im/,"I feel like I have made a terrible mistake in picking this college, I only went because it was cheap, and couldn't afford to go to UIUC, which was my best safety school. My tuition would have been free this semester, if not for the freshman living on campus rule. The school I am attending is very small, with only a few thousand people, and there's not a lot of activities or stuff to do on campus. Despite this, it couldn't be that bad, could it?


 Believe me, I tried to keep a positive atittude and was really excited about starting college and trying to make friends. However, I have autism, and it's a crucial part of my identity and my lifestyle, so I got in contract with my school's disability office to talk about accomadations for this school year. Big mistake. They argued with me about living off campus or having a single room, and told me the school needs money, so freshman have to live on campus. I have a math learning disability as well, and am in the process of more comprehensive testing to really ""prove it"" , but it was established that I really struggle in the subject. The only accomadation I got was more test time, and so far, I haven't even gotten that in my class. I was told that my school loves diversity, but it seems like they view me and my disorder as a hassle more than anything. 



I also had to fight them for a parking pass to go to my doctor's appointments, and they're making me park in a lot 2 miles off campus because I can't park where the upperclassman are, which is bullshit and has made me late so many times, because I can't scheduele my doctors appointments at an earlier/later time. I refuse to miss class. So far I've gotten multiple parking tickets, most of them for not knowing where to park because I was never told where the lot was and its not on the map, and they told me it was my fault. I've been told to just deal with living in the dorms  by everyone with the exception of the school doctor and councelor, who have put me on anxiety medication and are making me go to therapy every week to try and cope with being here. I tried living in my dorm and couldn't handle it cause of people and noise, so they switched my room to a suite that I share with other people, who completely ignore me and make me feel even more unwelcome there. I just quit staying in my dorm and am staying off campus in the place I share with my friend for free, in exchange for driving her to the bus so we can go to class.


Also, since I had to pay for a meal plan, I eat in the cafeteria most of the time and I saw someone who had no meals left, and swiped my card for them. The lunch lady at the register pulled me aside and told me I was never to do that again, or they would confiscate my card. I nearly cried. This school makes me incredibly nervous and rigid, and I haven't made any friends here at all. All of the clubs I would be interested in meet late at night, like video game and anime clubs, so I never have the energy to go. I've tried to form a club for autistic people but can't get it approved, and have tried everyday to sit in the disability center in the library to meet more people I can relate to, but with no luck. I'm trying sports, but I'm very uncooridinated and bad at talking, so I tend to ramble or make comments every two seconds, and I don't fit it at all on my incredibly small, tight knit club team. I don't fit in at this school in general either. Most of the campus is vegan and I get lectured my strangers about how eating meat is animal abuse. Like really, what the fuck? People write things like ""Violence is the answer. Violence is a necessity"" all over the sidewalks and that is allowed and often encouraged. One girl was pitching a fit on the bus about misgendering animals and how that's important, and as a trans person, I wanted to deck her for saying something like that. But no one at my school is interested in anything but politics, that's all most of the clubs or events are about, and a lot of the dicussions in my classes are about political stuff 90% of the time. You have to adapt the exact views of everyone else or you will not be accepted, or get bad grades for it. (Multiple people have told me this)


I am almost failing my Calculus class, failing both the first quiz and test. I've been going to tutoring at school and I'm going to get help outside of school, studying constantly, and meeting with my professor, but because my algebra skills are so poor, I can barely catch up. Yet, my professor thinks I shouldn't go back to precalc because I took it last year. I've been in tears so many times because I feel like a failure, and despite making As in my other classes, I can't have that low grade affecting my GPA. I need to get out of here. My family and partner are telling me to just be strong and get through it, that I'm acting like a child and will adjust if I force myself to, but I've tried, and I can't stand it here. I want to transfer to clemson, a school closer to home, where I can live off campus and make more connections. (I know people in the area and have support, whereas I only have one person at my current school) I'm working on the application, but I really don't know about the process besides that, and who i need to contact to send paperwork and transcripts over. Can someone who has transferred before offer advice in this trying time?


",college,Transferring in the fall after Freshman year? I'm fed up with my school,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/72992t/transferring_in_the_fall_after_freshman_year_im/,1506320074.0
34,throwaway_036,1505191383,/r/college/comments/6zktf9/i_came_to_the_terrible_realization_last_night/,"I've always had a bit of difficulty making friends. I've always been the ""quiet kid"" who never talks or the one who doesn't make eye contact, is very shy/introverted etc. In high school I had a small group of ""friends"" who were also a bit nerdy or whatever, but at times I didn't really feel like i was actually their friend. I never did anything with them outside of school even though they sometimes made plans w/o me, and I only sometimes participated in their conversations, etc. So I felt like I was the weird kid of the weird kids, but I thought maybe I was just being pessimistic.

So now let's fast forward to college (where I currently am as a sophomore). Even though I should have an easier time making friends since there's way more like-minded people here , I was still struggling. There were a few people (like 5-10) who you could call friends, but again I never really hung out with them outside of class, and after first semester was over and I got new classes, those friends dissipated and I got new ""friends"".

However, one friend I made first semester seemed to be more of a friend to me than anyone else (let's call her K, the first letter of her real name). I say this because every time she saw me she'd shout ""HI THROWAWAY_036!"" and seemed really happy to see me. She was part of a friend circle I had first semester where I'd have class and then go to lunch afterwards. She seemed to get me to participate in the conversations with my other friends and really seemed to care. So if I had to label someone as being my best friend it would probably have to be her. Furthermore, even during second semester when she wasn't in any of my classes, we'd see each other in the dining hall and we'd find each other and sit with each other. Then we'd talk for a bit, and somehow I was never nervous or socially awkward around her. I never ran out out things to talk about. I even considered that maybe I should ask her out or something, but I never did and after what happened last night I laugh at that thought.

So that was freshman year. At the beginning of Sophomore year (a couple weeks ago), I run into K outside my dorm and she says ""OMG THROWAWAY_036!!!"" or something like that and never in my life was someone so happy to see me. So she says we should hang out and I agree and I say I'll just text her. So I end up doing that, but she never responds. I see her in the dining hall a couple days later and mention that I texted her and she just goes ""ohh....uh yeah my phone broke"" in an odd voice but says that she'll text me and then we can hang out, so I say okay. But over the next week, she doesn't do that. Instead, I text her again AND facebook message her (we're friends on facebook and she regularly uses the site and the messanger app), but still no response from either medium (except she did say ""heyy got ur text this time"" but when I immediately asked her afterwards about plans so hang out she says nothing). So I see her a third time in person and say I texted her again and she has a similar response but she just says she's been busy, which is completely understandable (and true by the way; she's taking 21 credits and doing 20 hours of research a week and she's in 3-5 clubs and she's an RA).

That brings us to last night: I she her again for the dining hall and she says hi. I ask to sit with her since I had no one to sit with. She was sitting with another friend and just hesitates and says ""well.....not now since I'm having a private convo about some boy drama with [name of girl she's with]"". Odd response because I thought she trusted me and was her friend but I convinced them to let me sit with them. So I ask her how her weekend was and she says it was okay and that she went out with a bunch of friends, and that another friend came down from a nearby university. At this point I was confused because she hung out with so many people this weekend but she ignored me? If this wasn't enough the friend she was sitting with asked to get together and hang out with her right under my nose and she magically found a spot for her on her busy schedule, which was on her magically fixed phone. She was also texting other friends the whole time so yeah...her phone was not broken. And she never mentioned ANYTHING about wanting to hang out even after she mentioned how much she hung out with friends last weekend and says that ""all she wants to do is hang out with friends"" (but never mentions me). To top it off, she drops this on me: she says she's visiting New York next weekend, Phoenix another weekend, and Austin TX another weekend...during the semester, just on the weekend. I ask her how she does this (obviously how she has the time and money) but she just stares at me blankly and shy's ""uhhh...you just go?"" as if anyone can afford to do that.

At this point I felt physically ill, as if I was about to pass out, cry, or both. It was a negative emotion which was some odd combination of confusion, betrayal, denial, loneliness, and depression all at once. It was so obvious after this conversation that she doesn't view me as a real friend. She really wanted to hang out with me, but couldn't even though she made plans right under my nose and casually mentioned multiple friends coming over (and when she said her ""friends"" it was clear I was not a member of that set...)? At this point I realized that not only was she not my friend, no one was. There's those people who talk and pretend to be interested in me like her but then they end up hanging out with their real friends and not me, which is exactly why I've never made any formal plans with my ""friends"" my whole life. those kids back in high school? Not my friends. It's so obvious now. I remember them all talking about their stuff that they did together outside of school without me but I just always brushed it off.
So yeah, it sucks to come to this realization.

I'm also applying to 4 SUNYs but the only one I'm certain about is Binghampton

I don't want to apply to as many schools as I listed, the list used to be a lot longer. I took out a lot of schools that didn't offer a lot of financial aid. My EFC is 1320 but my mom can't actually contribute anything (she's in the process of paying me back money).

I've recently added UVA to my list because it has a lot of the things I want in a school. It's a big school with D1 sports, I think it has a good location, has generous financial aid, I looked into my major requirements and I liked the classes. I like the programs, the school has this good vibe about it if that makes sense. Honestly when I saw the website I just really like the school then when I looked at their academics I liked it a lot more.

Pomona has a ""Politics, Economics, Philosophy"" major that I like a lot. I'm currently a political science major but if I went to Pomona I would define lay try and change it to that. Pomona is a really good school for my major. It's in California which I love. I like that you can take classes at any one of the colleges on the Claremont campuses because I saw that some of he other schools had classes I liked. One of the drawbacks for me is how liberal the school is. When reading reviews about the school on Niche, which I do for every school I look at, the students said it was overwhelmingly liberal which is annoying to me. I also think they take the least amount of transfers of any school on my list.

Penn state was my dream school, I thought it was the best of both worlds academically and socially. I still think that but when I got accepted the first time I got about 25,000 in aid and this school cost over 50,000 for an out of state student so I don't think it would be financially doable honestly. When I visited I liked the people a lot more than I like the school. When I slept over at a dorm and ate in the cafe a lot of students sat with me and I thought that was really nice. This city girl also saw a cow for the first time which was cool. But when I got to the campus it was kind of a dud.I

I like UNC for a lot of the reasons I like UVA, big state school that still offers a good name and friendly people. A girl I watch on YouTube just graduated from UNC but I watch her vlogs and it seems like a great place. She shows the good and the bad, the activities, sororities, and sports etc and it seems like a place I could be happy.

Syracuse, I remember applying to Syracuse in highschool and then having the worse interview of my life so I pulled my application. Honestly right now I can't tell you what I like about Syracuse other than it's environment of students because I keep thinking about how mad that admissions officer made me. I know one negative about the school is the price tag.

Vanderbilt is really good for my major. I spoke to a representative at a college fair I went to this year and she told me I had a real shot of getting in. I like the program and internship opportunities I was told about. The main thing that concerns me is he schools location. I'm from NYC and I'm black. I've never directly faced racism so I honestly don't think about it that much so when I met with the Vanderbilt lady, I had never heard of the school before that, I thought this school is great I hope I get in. Then, as stupid as this sounds, I watched family guy last night where they drive through the south then got arrested and that freaked me out. Then I looked up most racist states and Tennessee was on the list. So that bothered me because I didn't know what to do with that information.

My hand is tired and for the rest of the schools it's mainly the same reasons as listed above. About the SUNYs btw the reason I'm not focused on them is because during my first application process my school pushed SUNYs onto us hard and I applied to four then like I am going to now. It was the most complicated process ever, they lost everything, I was supposed to be going to Buffalo and they changed the housing and over admitted people, the housing was so much money and the SUNYS I got into ended up costing more or around the same as most of the schools I got into. I am applying again but there aren't any that I love.

I want to go to a big school but I'm not against a small school. I want to go to a school where I can go to games I love hockey and baseball. No I wouldn't go to a school based on their sports but I am taking into account how much I will enjoy the school itself. I hated my highschool, I don't like my home life (it's one of my motivators in doing well, the thought of being able to leave), and I'm just not happy with my current situation so I want to be in a place where I will be happy. I plan on going to Law School, hopefully a tier one because I want to go into coorporate law. I want to have an internship while in school. I want to live somewhere really different from NYC because I've never loved any where else. I want to study abroad because I went on a highschool trip to Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein and I loved it there. As I said before I'm not into an extremely liberal school like Reed. And if the school is liberal I just don't want it to always be the topic of conversation. I want to dorm so I can have that experience. I don't think I can afford a sorority but I've always liked the thought of them. I don't care if the school is predominantly white or what the demographics are as long as it's a good environment to be in. I'm fine with any size classes, all my classes now have about 25 people but I'm not a big talker so I wouldn't mind a bigger room.

I could go to college about 2 hours away from home, or I could go to a branch campus about 15 minutes away from home. I want to go to the campus away from home because 
-they offer more degrees (not sure what I want to study yet)
-I've lived in my hometown forever and I want to experience being away from home
-I've always wanted to go to this school, and frankly I'm feeling pretty trapped in my hometown and I feel like it would be best for me to be away for a while.
Now here's my predicament: it costs about $10,000 more to go to the college away from home due to dorm costs. I did get a 4,000 scholarship and my dad is going to help me get through college but ultimately I will be taking out loans and paying them off after graduation. 
So, I could either:
A-go to my local college for a year and pay for an apartment instead of a dorm next year (about the same cost)
B- take a gap year and work to save up so I can attend the college away from town or,
C- go to the college away from town and graduate with debt.
So what should I do? I can't really get unbiased opinions here so I would appreciate any feedback! Thanks!

37,ybnice1234779,1491963876,/r/college/comments/64vh53/nyi_cant_decide_where_to_go_please_help/,"So I'm in my last year of High School, but I did pretty bad throughout the 4 years I did, so I applied to colleges that I'd like to attend, and some that I would most likely be accepted to.

I got rejected by almost all of them except CUNY CSI, and CUNY LaGuardia. I never expected to end up with only 2 community colleges, but now I have to pick. 

I don't want to stay there, I'm hoping to get my grades up and transfer out to John Jay, or something better than these two.

My problem is, although CSI is a 4 year college, it is also 2 hours away from where I live, so I would have to get up 2 hours before my classes start, so if I start a 8AM, I have to wake up at 5 AM to get ready and leave by 5:30 to get some head room. I can't dorm as it's about 11k, which I cannot afford.

Laguardia on the other hand, is about 30-40 minutes away, which is doable, but it's not a very good College, and is only 2 years. I've heard stories where people go to 2 year colleges, get lazy, and don't look for a 4 year college. I don;t want to be like that. I want to be in the FBI, or something along the lines of that, but as of right now, I'm facing a mid-life crisis, at the age of 17.

I'm just looking for some insight.

Thanks so much!

I know I can't truly afford going to a major university and plan to attend the local state school which runs at 12k (tuition and fees) and another 10k for room/food plan.

I hope to avoid the gigantic cost of room and board by finding people on the college reddit / facebook group to find accommodations near/cheap to th e school. Even though I would like to experience dorm life I believe I'm to cynical / introverted for that but I might have to.
Or join a fraternity that is based off my major/similar. 

I honestly don't know what to do exactly. I gotten to the point where I actually know the career field/job I want to aim for but not know how to go about getting started. I visited both the community colleges in my area and the state College. The community colleges seemed depressing and when I looked at their transfer and graduation rates I was turned off. 

I spoke with the lead engineer that i work with at times and he said the path I'm going would be the path he similarly took. He spoke about the area around the state University and how college was for him and his daughter. 
He stated making connections and friends would be easier as everyone would be new. Thus allowing it to be easier to find group / study partners and relationships compared to entering as a junior. 

I know going to cc is cheaper but I truly do want to experience the college life, build connections and relationships with people while having fun. 

I'm currently approaching 7 years out of school and truly concerned with the learning curve to get back in the groove of things.



When do you know how much $ FAFSA gives you before school?

When/if I need school loans which is best for me to obtain and in what amount do I do it for? Do I wait till FAFSA gives me what level of funding they give me or do I go based off the schools price?

How dumb is it to go to a state  school vs cc even though I been out of school for nearly 7 years?

My parents don't want me to go there as they have experience with my siblings going away to dorms just to mess around and flunk out without a degree. They think the same will happen to me so they've been opposing me every step of the way saying that they wont support me. 

On the alternative there is an even closer university near me that I can go to and not even worry about housing as I could just live with my parents. The problem with that the university doesn't have the degree, I want to pursue so it's not really an ideal choice.

I have no idea what to do, I'd like to go move into a dorm or an off campus housing apartment but I am afraid that I will end up flunking out like my siblings and having thousands of dollars in loans to pay off with no reward for it..

Here's the thing, though, I tend to have campus dinners with other girls who I've met in my classes and become good friends with in the span of a couple of weeks. I also have joined my friends when going to school functions, and I get along with my roommates just fine. But, I never go out with my roommates when they invite me to go out or invite me to take shots of alcohol with them when there's a party going on (These two girls in my dorm party with other people practically every Thursday). That last part is one of my reasons why, and although I don't mind a glass of sweet liquor on those rare occasions, I can't afford to be hungover on a school day when I have my studies to worry about. 

Also, I currently don't have a car of my own on campus, or off (still raising money for one) and if I go out with them on any of those nights, that can be fun, but I don't know these girls very well, and they don't know me very well. I've already established that I'm not an alcohol person like they are, and twice one of the girls has offered me shots of alcohol. 
The second time she asks after I told her I was doing my homework slightly annoyed me because I was busy with a big 4 page paper to work on that I didn't want to get a bad grade on, so I told her in a mix of a playful but annoyed tone to ""go away"" and shooed her off with a wave of my hand. She said I was being ""mean"" but she didn't take it personally and left me to my work after that. I haven't talked to her since that night, however. It's not that we hate each other, it's just that she hangs out with my roommate more. I tend to be doing my work whenever they enter into the room to chat with her, and I practically ignore them. But, of course, through the headphones, I tend to still hear what they're saying. I've been doing this for about two months now. I'm sure they feel like ""I'm not fun to be around with"" or ""pretty cold"" despite my friendly chats I have with them. It shouldn't matter, and I don't want to get caught in peer-pressuring situations because I'm at a point in my life where I have so much too loose, and my family's not wealthy, you know. I might do something with them around the end of the year (No shots, though. Maybe I'll grab a lime-rita for myself, instead) Has anyone ever been in the same situation with their roommates before?

Question is, outside of FAFSA and grants, how can I pay for the remainder. The field I'm entering has a salary that matches the degree and it also gives me options if I cannot get into the specific field right away.

My counselor said that I could stay for another two years at the community college and get more credits so I spend less money but I'm very depressed being at home and at the end of my rope.

Not great, but okay. I'll list my main concerns.

1. I feel like I'm not nearly doing enough for my education. I hear stories of college freshman doing so much more with their education and yet I'm still not sure what I'd like to do. I know I want to do something business related, but man, the idea of finding an internship right now might not be possible because I have no idea what I should intern in.

3. My lack of independence is starting to bother me. I still live at home while most of my peers live in dorms or apartments.
