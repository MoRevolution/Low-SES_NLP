0,currentlysylveon,1665186156,/r/college/comments/xydrqc/advice_for_a_newb/,"Good day, thank you for taking your time to read this. I am a twenty-three year old female that dropped out of high-school during my sophomore year. I was very lazy, unmotivated, and had parents that didn't really care or encourage me. I do not blame them, however, as I fully made the decision to drop out because I wanted to play on my phone all day, everyday. I have been working since I was sixteen and now, at twenty-three, have a full-time job as a manager in a grocery store. My department is a specialty department, henceforth meaning if someone calls out, I have to come in. I am also married, have a child, and a plethora of bills where I am unable to change or depart my job. It works out financially, but every week - especially with the way the economy is - I am always under or scraping by at bare minimum.

I got my GED in 2020 and ever since, I have been thinking of college. What I want to do, where I want to go, how I can afford it, how I can balance it with my demanding job. I have decided yet again to look into college, wishing to pursue nursing. I have grappled with this decision for the last year. I know what it takes. I know the sacrifice. I know the difficulty. My mom works for the hospital, my grandmother, my aunts (x3), my sister, my friends. I am also quite smart. I can't toot my own horn, but I am capable of the work. I simply need to dedicate myself, which if money is on the line, I know I can do.

I have many questions. I find it difficult thanks to Covid to get any insight in college. Most people won't meet in person and I need to see someone to understand what they're explaining, so whilst I'm not seeing any of you, I'm hoping someone can help me figure out, basically, how this all works?

First of all; I do not have any money. No savings, nothing. My spouse and I work in the same grocery store and make barely enough to pay our bills. Nothing more. Will student loans/FAFSA/etc pay for it all? And then I just have to pay it back, like a credit card bill?

Second of all; how does it . . . work? Do I pick classes and then just go to classes and pass them? How do I know I'm taking the right classes towards my degree?

Third of all; how do I fit it into my schedule? Night school, sure, but I am worried if I have to miss school for my job, because we go through highs and lows of employees. I've had to cancel many things in the past, but I don't wish for my education to suffer.

And then, simply, anything else you can share. Please Reddit, whatever you can throw at me. I'm all ears - I just want to better my life and the lives of my family.",college,Advice for a newb...,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xydrqc/advice_for_a_newb/,1665204156.0
1,Queenasheeba99,1660751657,/r/college/comments/wqsis1/help_am_i_paying_too_much_im_so_overwhelmed/,"I signed up for community college. I did a little research for my area because I wanted to pick one that wasn't too expensive, but also was close so if I wanted or needed to attend some classes in person, I would have that option. I looked at Bucks county, Philadelphia county, and Delaware County. Bucks seemed to be the cheapest and closest but I just signed up for 3 classes (part time minimum) and the total was $2778. I thought classes were about $500 on average, not $900. This was almost double what I expected to pay and now I'm freaking out a little because I only saved $5000 to start with. 
I haven't applied for scholarships yet but it looks like most say you have to be a full time student, which I can't afford! 
And yes the FAFSA basically gave me nothing because my dad makes 100k annually and apparently they don't take into account that we are a family of 8 so I get NOTHING from him.  

Do I cancel my payment and try to figure it out for the spring semester?? CAN I cancel a payment if I do so before school starts? 
Does anyone know of a cheaper but still quality college? 
I basically have to do online since I work full time 9-6 and can't get to classes in time. Alot of places only have certain degrees online. I thought I was lucky I found a place under 30 minutes away, had a business degree for online availability, and seemed to be comparable in price. 
Please help, my parents never went and know nothing about this. I feel so overwhelmed and covid prevented me from starting when I graduated, I just want to start.",college,Help! Am I paying too much?

2,alenamalina,1660517737,/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,"So I'm in a bit of a weird situation. Last year, my major changed its requirements about two weeks after the drop add period and I basically finished my major first semester of junior year, and finished my degree requirements last semester. But I really didn't want to graduate early at all. First off, I had really bad mental and physical health issues, and I had actually been trying to take the past two years off for that specifically but my parents did not let me. Why I listened to them I'm not sure, since I pay for college and rent myself with financial aid and multiple minimum wage jobs. This was incredibly difficult, at one point I ran out of money and couldn't afford food, and I started having daily panic attacks and a couple of strokes because of it. But also, part of me was mad at my shitty three years of college and I wanted to have a normal year. I knew this year's tuition would be covered by financial aid and scholarships so financially it wouldn't even be that bad of a decision.

Regardless, I'm going into my fourth year majoring in International Relations. When I was making decision I also thought, hey this will be cheaper and better than paying rent at home and job hunting for a field that I know I cant get a job in yet because I don't have enough experience or connections. I can work and save up for my last year and continue to network, especially since the IR field really needs connections and college was online for year and a half.

But the problem is, I... kind of hate my major. I've hated probably since about second semester sophomore year and I've been too stuck mentally to change it. I know, it's completely my fault and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions, but it still sucks. I originally wanted to get a masters in IR and work for a think tank or for the state department, or maybe work for a nonprofit. At first I actually liked the major until I started learning about the corruption in the field. Honestly idk what I expected. I went to college to learn, not to necessarily train for a job. 

Now.. I just want financial stability. After being abused and harassed at my minimum wage jobs for so long I can't stand being financially unstable and I don't want a job that pays $40k after obtaining a graduate degree. When I first went into this my parents actually promised to pay for half my tuition and rent, but because of family issues I had to start supporting myself starting sophomore year. That shit is incredibly fucking difficult on around $11-12 an hour, especially when jobs refuse to give you enough hours. I am tired of working hard for terrible pay. Basically, after going from a family that was relatively well off to struggling to survive, my priorities have shifted. I no longer want to help people for work and I'd rather do some job I tolerate and do what I enjoy outside of work, including activism and learning about politics.

I've found that the only thing I really enjoy in this major is data analysis and research. I think working with R is fun and I never understood why people were struggling with it. This past summer I did some RA work for my professor and I'm doing my own research project this semester, and I'm also working as an RA for another professor.

So I've thought about a relatively different career path as a data scientist. I like working with numbers and I feel like this will make me a livable wage. I've thought about adding an information science degree, since it'll give me the skills I need to get into this field. But I've also thought about going into grad school. Here's where I'm unsure. Should I basically get a second bachelors in information science and go into data science, or should I just whatever classes I can in programming (like for R, SQL, and python), learn the rest on my own, and apply to grad school for data science? Or, can I learn these on my own and get a job in data science with just my bachelors in IR?

In terms of cost, I have this year's tuition and living accommodations covered, but I'm not sure that I'll get aid for my fifth year. I know I can potentially get a local scholarship and maybe a few grants, an interest free loan from a local scholarship, and I know that since this isn't technically my second bachelors I can also get loans from FAFSA. I've also thought about bootcamp, but to be honest its more expensive than what I would pay for one year at my state  university.

Is it worth the time and investment? Or am I just fucking stupid",college,Adding a major senior year,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/woj8c6/adding_a_major_senior_year/,1660535737.0
3,aapetired,1660337040,/r/college/comments/wmvgp0/did_you_work_full_time_through_full_time_school/,"I'm going into the last year of my undergrad degree, I've been working full time all through college,  taking 16+ credits a term (even though 12cr is considered full time at my university). This coming school year I also have a 15hr a week internship. I'm planning on taking a gap year before going back for a masters degree (the program I'm in offers an accelerated master's program for people that completed their undergrad at this university, so I can finish my master's in one year). (I'm in the U.S. by the way)

I'm really worried about being able to manage finishing a graduate degree while working full time. This undergrad degree feels like it's killing me, but I really can't do anything with this degree, I need a master's to even use it. I don't have the option to not work full time. I need the benefits (health insurance) and the income to afford my bills, I support myself and am estranged/no contact with my family, so I don't have literally anyone else that can help me out financially. I also make just barely too much money to get a pell grant or anything like that, and my student loans don't fully cover my tuition - I have to pay 500-1000 out of pocket every term. I can't afford to cut back my hours at work. 

I know it's just a couple more years, but last term I ended up in the hospital due to overworking myself (40 hrs a week at work, 20 credits in school to avoid having to take summer classes). I'm worried about balancing an internship, full time job, and full time school this coming year. I contacted my field work advisor and academic advisor and they were of no help at all. Everyone just says ""self care"", which I try my best to do. 

I can't be the only one in this boat, how do you manage it? Is it even feasible to work full time while in grad school?

4,iknowobamasfirstname,1653327962,/r/college/comments/uw5wnv/incoming_freshman_selfimprovement_checklist/,"I'm moving into my dorm in just under three months and I wanted to share my list of personal self-improvements so I can make the most of my college experience. Any suggestions or even your own lists are welcome.

- First and foremost, I need to get out of my room, dude! I don't have to be a hermit anymore to evade my family. My dorm building is full of opportunities to socialize, especially since it only houses freshmen, and I really gotta take advantage if I'm paying all that money for it. The way the building is structured is that it's a tower with a sort of hangout area in each floor; maybe I could bring my Switch, hook it up to one of the TVs, and invite others to play with me. Or study in that area... anything to not fester in my dorm room.

- Get used to being more open. I'll have a random roommate (luckily, they have a roommate matching system to pair those with common interests/habits) so most privacy is off the table anyway, but I just gotta be more interesting. I do a lot of cool things - art, animation, creative writing, all of that on top of majoring in CS - and I'm not usually expressive about these. Since I have nothing to hide anymore (overbearing family), why not show people the cool stuff I make? This also goes for things like my favorite music artists, animes, etc., many of which I wear on my clothes. I get judged every day at home for these, but once I move out, who's going to really give a damn about what I wear? I could connect with someone through these anyway.

- Be presentable. Nothing crazy, just keep my consistent hygiene habits going, brush my teeth more often, and (this is a little embarrassing to admit but) keep my hands off my face and get my nails growing healthy again after so many months of stress. I've promised myself to start these right after my high school graduation two weeks from now. Quitting is honestly harder for me than it might seem.

- Hit the gym if I can. They have a recreational building with a full gymnasium near my dorm, and if my schedule can fit it in, maybe get a good workout in occasionally. I need to gain muscle weight and not look like a walking skeleton.

- Stop procrastinating. I can't breeze through my schoolwork at the last minute anymore, especially not with a STEM major.

- Know my campus and get involved, take advantage of extra educational opportunities, and find a good work-study program. They all pay the same towards my tuition so it's just a matter of picking what sounds cool.

- Be careful with my spending habits. I can't really afford to throw money out the window as I do already.

I guess that's pretty much it. Again, any general suggestions or your personal goals are appreciated :)",college,Incoming freshman self-improvement checklist,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/uw5wnv/incoming_freshman_selfimprovement_checklist/,1653345962.0

6,Narguin2,1650785709,/r/college/comments/uapfv6/ive_been_feeling_extremely_depressed_recently/,"I like science. I love bio. I'm okay with chem. I absolutely adore learning about diseases and immunology. I was set on becoming a doctor ever since I was a kid and it was in high school when I decided I wanted to become an immunologist. I was a part of so many medical/healthcare related clubs in high school and was always the top of the class when it came to physiology and bio. I was also the top student in my high school's medical program. I just loved health and medicine.

However, when I entered college, I began attending seminars where people who had worked in the medical field would come and talk to students. I began to realize that I can't afford to do ~10 more years of schooling/ training and I certainly cannot afford to carry on the amount of debt that will accrue while in med school. I'm a first gen student from an immigrant, low-income family. My parents are getting old and I need to take care of them soon. They're expecting me to get a well-paying job straight out of undergrad which is incredibly unrealistic unless I was a CS major, which I am not. I'm pursuing a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology with a concentration in either biochem, genetics, neurobiology, or immunology. I was initially leaning towards immunology, but apparently it's not a very lucrative area? 

I don't even care about what I like anymore because I feel like what I like (immunology, studying infectious diseases, etc.) doesn't appear to pay very well, at least straight out of undergrad. My concern rn is how high my income will be but with a bio degree and the oversaturation of the bio field, my chances of getting a well-paying job seem low. Everyone is telling me to pursue my passion but I'm starting to hate it because my mind is just automatically filled with shame and guilt because my intended field is not lucrative enough.

Idk what I should do now. I'm going to be a junior next semester. I can't realistically switch to compsci or data science because the courses are just notoriously difficult at my university and I'll need to take summer classes if I want to complete a CS or DS degree on time which I cannot afford even with financial aid and most of the courses my university requires do not have a CC equivalent since my university expects a certain level of rigor.

I'm trying to think of a plan now. I'm definitely going to drop premed. I'm thinking of doing a bunch of data science or compsci certification programs and maybe combining those with my bio degree (idk which concentration I should do) will land me a good job in the biotech field or pharmtech field? Should I choose the genetics concentration for my bio major? Or, something that might be slightly better would be to switch my med school goals to PA school instead and become a physician assistant. It's less years but idrk a lot about the process. 

Idk I'm just really stressed out about my future and living up to my parents' expectations. I haven't been able to pull myself out of bed recently and just feel super despondent about everything. I don't wanna talk to any of my friends. I don't want to talk to my partner. I don't want to talk to my parents. I just feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame so I can only turn to an anonymous forum on the internet for some advice. 

Sorry for the long spiel and I would appreciate any life advice.

8,okayshark,1647359489,/r/college/comments/tes33g/physics_biology_dilemma_on_whether_i_should/,"TLDR is at the bottom as well as my questions. This turned out very long, I apologize.

To start out i would like to say this: I love physics, ever since i was in elementary school i've loved physics phenomena, lasers, optics and had marvelled at the fact that we can explain so much about the universe. I took physics as one of my Leistungskurse (elevated courses with more hours in German high schools), did my hs graduation exam in it and finished with an excellent score. I really did enjoy it all the way and our teacher was super chill and supportive, in general all my physics teachers were very cool and made our lessons fun with many very interesting experiments. It's a language that we can explore the universe in and that makes it very exciting.

So it's no wonder i went into university pretty determined on physics, however i didn't make my decision based on one specific job i wanted to do, but coming from a thirst for knowledge.

In high school, my strategy was to pay attention in lessons and thoroughly write everything down and take notes. I wasn't the kid that caught up to everything the teacher said in the lesson and when preparing for exams or revising I would sit and go through everything by myself. This was a very good method for me personally because i could understand the concepts and their connections in my own pace and understand things through my own methods. It might sound weird that the kid who was regarded as one of the top students sometimes couldn't have answered the most simple questions on a new topic, but that's how it was, i just needed the time.

But ever since the bridge courses before the semester i've been struggling. I'm told that it's normal for first years to feel like everyone around you knows everything and only you are behind, but after a semester the feeling is still strongly there. I will admit I have made many mistakes, like starting the more in-depth math courses from the beginning and not revising after every other class. As the workload was immense, I barely slept in the first two months. This in turn lead to me barely being able to stay awake in class and tutorials. I acknowledge these mistakes and have already made adjustments to lighten the load.

Now, as for uni, the sheer amount of stuff we have to learn, on our own, at my university -which might be a normal amount, given this is university- is a lot to approach with my method. We were advised to study in groups and do our weekly exercise sheets together, and though I had some moments of victory where I could do one exercise, mostly it consisted of the other students talking about the topic like they understood it really well while I sat there and listened for any coherent crumbs of info and sometimes asked for a tip on how to proceed. Admittedly this was not a good method and I found some people closer to my pace who I could study with, but they weren't always there or we ended up sitting with our sheets well into dusk. So by the time I got home I was tired and turned to my phone for an escape lot of the time. Now I know that delaying catching up with our topics is a bad strategy due to time and the amount of material. But it seems like it's good if i take the time to catch up and revise by myself, also because the way things are explained in class don't always work for me.

As for the social aspect of it, there wasn't really a time where I felt that I fit in or that I have much in common with anyone there except maybe when we were talking about art. I also found myself rethinking my choices a lot. I missed my friends and my family immensely and honestly struggled to feel human at times. I haven't really been able to find the motivation to study beyond the desire to get through another week.

When I look into what kind of scripts belong to classes in later semesters, the topics seem interesting, still it's pages of text with about the same amount of equations which i'm sure contain so much interesting and informative stuff.. Still right now that aspect of ""woah that's so cool"" is kind of missing. Maybe that will come later, i figure when we get to more stuff that's beyond mechanics.

I suspect I might also have ADHD and may be nd in other ways which i will get checked out with a professional if i am able to. So to be clear i'm not self diagnosing, but i'm constantly reading up on these subjects and honestly everything seems to make so much more sense.

So that's a little bit on how I have felt about my first semester of physics.

The thing is, beside physics, I'm also very interested in biology. Our university has a small biology faculty and it seems to be much cozier than 200-300 people in physics. The longer i've thought about it, the more i find myself interested in life and the parts of science that deal with living things. I took biology as a Basiskurs (a course that has less lessons and is more simplified compared to Leistungskurs) and I loved it. At school i've done several presentations in both physics and biology (and ethics) and I loved doing those, I find it's so much fun to research things and share them with others in a way that's engaging and comprehensive. I watch science videos and listen to podcasts in my free time as well, like Scishow (both vids and podcasts) and books like The Selfish Gene (that i found super interesting and recommend!!), and generally beside physics, a lot of them have a lot to do with biology. I find that these pieces of media don't overwhelm me and i want to know more about them, in general all kinds of stuff that have to do with life feel like tangible things to me and they kind of fall into place in the big scheme of things. I hope i phrased that in a way that's understandable.

I will implement new strategies in the coming semester and am in the process of hopefully getting a private tutor. I'm determined to go through my second semester in physics and reevaluate things after, but the way things are looking for me mentally right now, i think going with something that is naturally and directly engaging and has a sense of novelty and many little rewards that are directly applicable (so: biology) would lighten the load for now. Going into uni i talked with some advisors from both faculties on doing two bachelors, they said it was possible but i should rather wait. I would even consider doing them one after another with no overlap (of course i'd have to start working a job too eventually, to afford rent and basic expenses, right now i have a very amazing scholarship and mainly my parent's support paying for that)

The direction that would unite like, almost if not all of my interests well (given my current level of being informed) would be neuroscience. I think it's just in the sweet spot between big stuff and small stuff -ie. humans between particles and the universe and it has that direct application to life that i'm looking for as well as physics and biology. My dad is a surgeon and he has inspired me a lot to look into things that have to do with humans and with medicine, and when we learned about the brain in bio in hs i was always like ""heh i can't wait to learn more about this"". So far it's been the most definite career that i could see myself pursuing in the area of science. I want to help people and i want to feel like i am needed.  
I still wish to pursue physics, because i love it after all and I Want To Understand Those Things!!!!(tm) also the experience and learned methods are definitely very valuable and give good prospects. I know it will remain a passion. But maybe it could be better to do it when I have the resources, support system that i also have control over, and maturity to do so.

TLDR: first semester of physics was a lot to handle partly because of inexperience and partly because it's A Lot, took a toll on me mentally. Implementing new and improved strategy for second semester, will see how things turn out. However, also want to do biology at one point, maybe doing it earlier would benefit my mental wellbeing more? Would love to combine both in future job, not sure of the road to there though.

Question to you: Have you had any experiences like this? Is it worth it to keep pushing? Will things change?  
Also: if you have experience starting out in physics and then going into biology later (maybe even not from a bachelors, like from a masters with overlap in bio or a job) how is that road?

9,Dorocello,1646481141,/r/college/comments/t77wl5/i_have_to_make_a_very_important_life_decision/,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing well, I don't know where to post this so I'm posting it here. In a few days, I have to make a very important decision regarding higher education which will directly affect the next 10 years of my life and I wanted to ask for advice from someone who has been in the real world. I will try to be as detailed as possible, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

First and foremost, I live in the middle east, so life here is a bit different from western and eastern countries. I studied mechanical engineering in high school and I was really good at it. Upon graduating I was encouraged to enroll in a 2-year community college for a practical engineering degree. I am now 19 and almost done with my first year and I didn't like it very much because I realized that it isn't what I wanted to do. I graduated on an honors roll and know that I can do more with my life than an associate's degree. I tried to transfer to a different major but got rejected multiple times. In a few days, I will have to decide if I will continue to the second year of a degree or drop out and go to the military for 3 years. My family and teachers want me to stay but I don't know that I don't want to do this profession for the rest of my life. There will be massive consequences to this decision for there are pros and cons to getting this degree:

The pros of getting the degree:

1) As a practical engineer I will earn a higher salary in the military and will be able to save most of it because I don't need to pay for food and housing. After my service, I will be able to afford to study in a good university without getting into debt (hopefully) or even studying abroad and getting citizenship in a different country which I might do in the future.

2) Because of the saved money I won't need to work (or at least work as much) meaningless college jobs like fast food or retail while studying to earn money and can focus fully on my education.

3) If I will end up having a change of heart and decide to major in this specific field, I will be able to shorten my higher education by a year, and with possible scholarships, reduce my expenses even further. In addition, the work experience in the military will help me stand out in the job market, but currently, this is the least of my concerns.

The cons of getting the degree:

1) If I finish the degree I will need to serve an additional 1.5 years in the military. This is a problem because I won't be able to leave. Most people end up doing something they dislike in there, and if that's the case I will be doing it for longer. In addition to this, I'm afraid that I will be finishing the degree and working purely for the money, and I know how soul-sucking and miserable these jobs can be.

2) When I'm going to finish my service I will likely be 24 by then. Even in my country, most people get a bachelor's at 24-25, I will get it at 28 if I go immediately after I finish serving which makes me feel behind in life, especially to the average person who has gotten their degree at 22. I will be spending most of my 20s in academia and the military which doesn't give me a lot of spare time due to opportunity costs.

3) On its own the practical engineering degree isn't worth much even with the work experience, especially the mechanical engineering one which encourages those who have it to go to university regardless. Because I will most likely end up majoring in a different field, I feel like all of those extra years spent would be wasted for nothing.

4) This is my personal problem. Getting an associate's degree in my country is only good for those who can't or don't want to get a bachelor's for academic reasons (or those who want a mundane government job). Most of my class is filled with underachievers and the material is taught accordingly. I barely managed to get through the first year due to the absolute boredom and thought that I was wasting my life. This damages my straight-A student ego knowing that I could leave this place and go to a normal college to get a more valuable degree that would make me more money in the future like EE or CS, but the thought of getting into debt and working overtime while studying already challenging curriculum doesn't bring me comfort either.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude: I am still not sure what I want to do in the future but I won't have a lot of money to spare. In addition, I keep reading online that mechanical engineering is a dead-end field with few opportunities and that all capable people should go into tech. I also keep reading that you should be doing something that you're good at even if you don't like it instead of following your passion. If anyone can offer a real-world perspective on this situation i would be very grateful.

10,ApeBlender,1645997865,/r/college/comments/t2yivq/study_electrical_engineering_at_u_of_m_or_nearby/,"        I'm a highschool senior living in West Michigan choosing between two schools to study engineering at right now: University of Michigan and Oakland University. Oakland University is a medium sized school with around 12,000 students and good engineering programs. It has stuck out to me throughout my college application process because of the many merit and financial need based scholarships I'm eligible for there. My family is well off enough but my parents can't afford to pay for any of my college so I'll be taking out student loans or paying out of pocket for everything. Money has been a big factor throughout the process. 
        I applied to U of M just to see if I got in, I wasn't really planning on attending due to the money issue. However, this changed a few days ago. I received an email that I'd been accepted to U of M which was awesome, and I also received the HAIL scholarship which is full tuition for 4 years. Now it's not so clear to me if I should go to Oakland or U of M. 
       At Oakland I've received scholarships covering full tuition and half of housing. As it stands Oakland will cost $6,000 a year not counting local scholarships per additional Oakland application based scholarships. 
         U of M currently will cost around $12,000 a year currently, however I haven't received my financial aid offering from them yet. 
         I've always been a small town guy and honestly the size and scope of U of M is intimidating to me. The accounts of snobby and arrogant students don't thrill me either. I've visited Oakland and done lots of research on it and to a certain extent I've fallen in love with it. The location is a plus for me as not too far north there are beautiful woodlands and natural areas I'd like to camp in and explore. Oakland has a great advising and job placement program which I've heard can be hard to find at Michigan due to the large student body. However, I recognize that U of M will probably provide a better education and more opportunities anyways, but right now I can't decide if that will be worth the extra money. 
        I'm fairly outgoing but I wouldn't describe myself as competitive (easygoing would be a better term) which from what I've read is a big deal if you're trying to thrive at U of M. I want to be social in college but I don't ever plan on drinking or partying so that's not an issue for me. There are various other cons that come with attending U of M vs Oakland, most of them related to the size of the school (transportation - especially for engineers living on the north campus - and parking seem to be a big headache which is a problem for me as I plan on driving to Lansing quite frequently).
        The main problem here is I've obviously never been to college, and I don't know what a college experience is like, so how could I possibly compare them. In the end the decision will still fall on me, but if anyone has any words of advice I would greatly appreciate them.

Also there's probably a couple hundred things I forgot to mention so if there are important factors I've left out feel free to ask and I will share.",college,Study Electrical Engineering at U of M or nearby medium sized school?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/t2yivq/study_electrical_engineering_at_u_of_m_or_nearby/,1646015865.0
11,Single-Ad-7792,1642596572,/r/college/comments/s7pfx1/parents_refuse_to_help_me_pay_for_college_despite/,"Just a preface: I am only sixteen, and I definitely don't know a ton about the college experience. Aside from the community college that I go to, I don't really know a lot about it. So, my apologies if I am just ignorant of some basic fact. Anyways, my parents have sat me and my brothers down and told us that they would not be supporting us financially through college. We were, (I believe understandably) upset about this, and I just think that it doesn't even make any sense. It would be one thing if my parents could not afford it, but my dad makes over six figures, and saves a great deal of his money. (Recently though, he might get fired from his job due to refusing a COVID vaccine, but that doesn't really matter here.)

The main thing is that while I am going to basically be all on my own once I leave high school, I won't be able to get support from student aid programs due to how much money my family already makes. My parents aren't super knowledgeable when it comes to college, both of them dropped out before they could get their two-year degree. I really want to be able to go to a nice school and pursue a career in medicine, but I know that I will be struggling at best if I chose this route. They tell me that scholarships can easily cover my full cost, but my mom's college was paid for by her parents, and my dad dropped out after a year, so they don't really know a ton about this stuff. It just sucks to know I'll struggle more than I have to because of my parent's ""tough love"" by not supporting us at all. 

I'm working right now to graduate HS with a two-year degree from a local community college, but I just can't do this all on my own. I feel incredibly stressed right now thinking about all of this, and that the next few years of my life are just going to be hell.

Tw: mental heal

Tbh, I don't know if I can continue with life anymore. I'm so tired with everything. I get up only to stress over studying for a major that I, despite liking, probably won't be able to pass this semester, work at a job i don't like (to which the only other jobs I can work at are worse), stress over a student org leadership position that I hate (because it looks good on my resume), stress over my future prospects for a career that I hate the least (because I'm not smart enough or do not have the connections to get into fields that are somewhat interesting), and stress over the fact that I don't have an internship because it's probably screwing my employability in the future.

Essentially, the present has tired me out. I don't have any friends or family I can turn to. I dont have friends because I have given up so much time to a failed attempt to make my grades and resume look good. I can't go to my family because I have had to hide my identity (since middle school) in order to not get kicked out and be able to have a home. I don't have any more motivation to keep living. I hate waking up knowing that I have to go through another shitty day.

The future isn't any better. The only path I can see is to be stuck in a shitty job only to retire alone because I have already sabatoged any social life I could have had. And this is already ""good"" considering how I cant even manage my present situation, so I'd probably be homeless by then instead of even being in at least a shitty job that can pay the bills.

Idk what to do at this point. Is there even anything I can do? I can't afford to take a step back to reflect on what I really want to do due to social stigma from family/culture and financial reasons. The only thing I can do is hope I get lucky some time in the future, but that hope is  waning and I can't see a way out.",college,How do you get yourself to continue day to day?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/s7kimj/how_do_you_get_yourself_to_continue_day_to_day/,1642595035.0
13,throwaway-ux,1639734091,/r/college/comments/ridx3y/im_a_junior_at_university_that_just_failed_all/,"I'm a junior in college. I pay my own way other than my parents help with my food plan. Only adding that to the back story for financial reasons. 

Before I get the ""just keep going"" comments, my mental health in college has always been bad. But I can't afford therapy.  My family won't help me without controlling (or trying to through guilting me) who I see for a therapist (they would have to fit a bunch of requirements just for my parents let alone me). This semester I could almost never get out of bed. I just want it all to be over. I had dreams. But now, I can't even afford the help I need even if I did trust people because no one I know has that kind of money. My university is booked up, and while administrators are frustrated about that because they are supposed to offer services to students, that expansion is.. Well, slow as molasses.

I was trying to build my GPA from what I thought was a bad first semester slowly so I could graduate with a 3.5 in the honors college (I've never gotten all A's) but I had a 3.1 beginning this fall. Now I'm going to have about a 2.5-2.6. I would have to basically get an entire other degree to get a 3.5, let alone any higher... So my first thought was cut things.. I work because I have to pay bills, so I can't cut that. But I can't cut school right now either because my scholarship to go here will be forfeited if I leave (yes, I checked) and I'm at the minimum credit hours for my college degree (16) I don't see how succeeding and graduating is even possible, let alone anything post graduate.

When I was first starting college I was depressed, but I loved the material. At this point I KNOW (like 100%) that it's not a material comprehension issue. In fact, I've probably robbed myself of the opportunity to have comprehension issues because I either haven't learned and I'm just guessing or I've been depressed for so long even if I am smart enough then I'm just not good enough cause my mind goes hopeless quick. I'm not sure. I don't want to be treated differently because my grades are a reflection and snapshot of my mental health basically 24/7, like I don't want to be pitied. I recognize my grades are my responsibility, and school/professors shouldn't feel obligated to help me or let me turn in things late when I can't get out of bed. I need to manage it and do better and be better. That's on me.

But damn.. I'm so tired of waking up and making my reality of grades worse even though I'm trying to get better on my own. I'm trying. I TRIED this semester and now the silent 3.5-3.0 cutoff of grad school even is going away. Has anyone ever come out of this?? I still... Well.. I wanted to pursue my field. I still had passion about it. I know I'm not good enough but I have the attitude. I could do it if I wasn't stuck all the time in my head. But the computer that will kick me out of grad school before I even start does not give a crap about my excuses. 

Sorry for the long post. I need advice on understanding how to graduate from here and if anyone else has had anything similar happen?

I am infuriated, frustrated, but more than anything I am in a MAJOR panic financially as this could destroy me. I am VERY low income but I am fighting to complete my master's degree and improve my quality of life.

Through undergrad I never really did the summer thing, but I ALWAYS knew the requirements for summer course loads are different than regular semester loads. For example, my friend's uni has a 4 credit minimum for full time enrollment for summer. Apparently, my school is the same for all semester. so 12 credit minimum to be considered full time, even in the summer (yikes..)   


Apparently as well, to get aid from FAFSA, you need a minimum of 5 credits. I did not know this. I tried digging around to find this information on my school's website, and it's legit just not there and the information is very difficult to find. I had to search on the .gov website to find the info.   


long story short, I enrolled for a summer course. Financial aid never said anything to me. I enrolled, applied for aid, was granted aid. half way through summer course I'm like where the flip is my aid? I reach out to them to ask what the hold up is (delays have been common especially since covid) and then they inform me because my class is only worth 4 credits, I do not qualify for aid and it is too late to drop the course and now I can pay the full 5k and keep the course going, or drop it and pay a % of the tuition cost. (roughly 3,000) W.T.F!? Had I know about the 5 credit minimum I would not have enrolled into summer courses, ESPECIALLY because for my degree only one 4 credit course was even available. I am trying to petition but they're saying I have to be mentally ill or sick, or have a death in the family and prove to them this to get the refund for extenuating circumstances. I did that, showing meds I have, a divorce I went through (even those it's not even the reason but whatever I cant afford the fee they're trying to give me) but I don't think anything I submitted qualified as the timing of my divorce and my meds/depression was a month or two prior to the start of summer semester.   


Does anyone feel this is off at all? Shouldn't financial aid have reached out to me sooner to warn me BEFORE the deadline that I don't qualify for student aid?

15,Dandelion-Taxik,1607724902,/r/college/comments/kbcmbv/thinking_of_switching_from_architecture_to_web/,"I am a 2nd-year architecture student at a CA community college, going into my 3rd year of undergrad. A month or so recently I developed serious doubts about my major, thinking of my future and what I want it to be like: job, daily life, place of living, finances, and social life. As of now, I am pretty much on track for a grad transfer for B.A. in Arch. at UCB: I have a solid network, a good transfer plan/plan of action, some insight into the industry, via interviews from people who work in it (intern, junior, senior,) and completion of most of my base arch. classes (1 year to go.) However, the more I keep thinking of architecture, the more I am anxious and pessimistic about it, especially grad school. 

The prime and most important reason is that I no longer have the same excitement about it anymore now that I've gone through the more technical architecture classes, residential design for example. Other reasons include:

1) Worrying about my ability to climb the corporate ladder after uni. education or rather the time it takes to do so per effort.

2) Not at all ok with the dismal financial prospects of the profession.

3) A commonly reported lack of the creative aspect on the job in day-to-day life compared to other elements like legal and business inquiries. I want my job to be a good deal of collaboration, design, and business work, a nice mesh/combo of elements, none of which dominate the other two unless I wish it to. (Last bit accounts for any future endeavors I might pursue in the future: not everything can be planned.)

4) Having to switch careers at 25-26 when in actuality I want this question to be figured out by my current age so by 25-30 I settle myself into a niche within the industry. I am very grateful for my current circumstances, a family that supports my prolonged time in college and does not ask me to pay for rent. I want to take advantage of this time and opportunities, not ask for them (opportunities) again by 25-26.

5) The common reported lack of life balance within the profession, specifically after years of experinece. I definitely do not expect to have any life balance in my 20s, because my 20s is just ""work."" But, I do want to be able to make my job a big part of my life, but not ALL of my life: I do want to account for possible children at age 30-35, and specifically being able to afford myself and them by that time. 

6) The common high debts reported on this major. I want to minimize costs and maximize my time so I can create other financial or business assets that I can leverage for any design endeavors I might want to pursue.

7) The specificity of this field. Sure, architecture is pretty general for other construction spheres and does touch upon other areas like industrial design, but I'm not sure its as general as I would like it to be. 

Now, I know ux/ui and generally, product design, is a hot field right now, getting saturated with a lot of people who are just starting out, a good deal of them career-switchers. And I admit, having the life that a lot of people in these professions report sounds pretty good to me. However, I am not blind: every profession is difficult, it is its own thing, and deserves one to put effort into it. Those who are the best and employ themselves are the most satisfied and financially secure individuals because they do not give up their own power to someone else. And it is important to actually like the profession for it to hold up long-term because the pursuit of interest is what ultimately drives personal satisfaction and exterior success. 

I want to actually be good at what I do, not just jump in on a hot profession for the lifestyle or money it provides. And so pursuing at least an industry of interest and an industry that fits my other life goals while in college is important to me. I know a B.A. doesn't gurantee a job, much less a related one or a good one, but I think switching my focus officially to product design and working on it by myself on the side is the best combination for my current age and situation. My family basically wants me to get a B.A. in anything, as long as it is something and affordable. Time for them does not matter, surprisingly. I think the area of interest for me now is ui design, the superficial side of product development. I like working with graphics, motion, 3D, learning new technologies, and I am definitely very excited about thinking how a user would be interacting with what I make and why: that is the core reason I pursue architecture now, just a different medium. I think ux and product design is also of major interest to me, but ui is really the field I want to zone in on.I am definitely not up for going full on computer science as a major: I want to approach ui and related fields more from design and maybe a minor in business to navigate the market.

So, here are some of my plans of action:

1) Continue architecture and graduate with a BA in it, then do a boot camp to see if product design/ux/ui is for me.

2) Abandon architecture all together and pursue product  design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit.

3) Continue architecture and take a class on product design/ux/ui, depending on what feels like the best fit, and do free courses on web design-related content over winter break, so I know what I am getting into. Not full-time, but enough to get some understanding of it. (This is the current plan for spring 2020 since I can't take many classes on product design: they are either filled up or I was stupid enough to not be applicable for them since I am not a student for those colleges. Plans 1 and 2 would apply to next summer and fall 2020.)

I'll be getting those two credits out of the way this Spring.

Now of course, we can debate all we want on whether this is helping student become more well rounded and socially conscious or is just the university's way of trying to squeeze more money out of students by requiring classes that are unnecessary to their field (probably a little bit of both, imo) but here's the thing.

I've always like the idea of getting a degree in humanities and spending my four years at college learning and discussing topics like this. The only reason I didn't was because no one (especially my family) thought that would be practical, especially since I have to take out loans to afford to even come here (also, my main scholarship is from the engineering school, so can't just leave it)

Which is why I'm a Computer Science major because it's a degree that will increase my chances of being able to immediately get a job with a decent pay grade and the tech makes the world go round, so no chances I'd lose job security anytime soon.

That being said, I'm bored with the field. I have no interest in it whatsoever outside the practical financial ones. Every few weeks, we sit through a presentation about how cool being an engineer/programmer/software developer is and how we're changing the world while getting paid a whole bunch, but outside of the money I'm not feeling it. I honestly think once my schedule is less gen-eds and more CompSci heavy I'll go insane.

So I've been thinking and researching and my current schedule for next semester will give me 6 credit hours that fit with the Women's and Gender Studies minor (which is only 15 credit hours in total).

And it seems like a fun field to be in, discussing topics that I really care about and would like to learn more about.

I probably won't talk to my advisor about it until Summer when it's time to pick out my schedule for Fall. I can't talk to my parents about it because they'll just tell me I'm being impractical and I shouldn't waste my time with such a useless thing (which is their response when I bring up anything I'm interested in). I have one friend from my LGBTQ+ group who is already in humanities so I'll probably talk to them about it next meeting.

But, I just need some feedback here. Am I just following a pipe dream? Should I be dedicating all my time and energy towards my major, the very idea of which sucks the life out of me?

4 years ago I was in a position like many of you are right now finishing high school and not having a lot of guidance or idea of what I really wanted or what I really needed other than the fact my mother told me ""You can go to college and live at home, or you can not go to college and get kicked out, it's up to you."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That said I was no more than a 2.7GPA in high school and a 2.99GPA finishing off college so I am by no means a top of my class student in any realm, in fact I think that puts me basically at the bottom, basically a C average student at best, even though I felt I really tried (attending multiple hours of after school tutoring sessions, etc.. nothing really clicked), I scored an 18 on my ACT (well below the a good score) and was told to basically stay away from anything STEM related. So I can say with confidence that there are people in a lot better situations (and those in less than or equal to as well) in terms of finances, scholarships, and college advice, and I want to hopefully even help just ONE person with this post.

This post isn't geared at someone who's got the full ride to their dream college, its geared towards someone who doesn't know what they want to do with their life, or even someone who just cannot outright afford university whether it be because their family isn't contributing or they don't get any financial aid, or they don't have any scholarships in general. **These are all very real scenarios that the majority of people run into all the time, and it can be crippling to your future if not handled correctly.**

**PLEASE** consider dual enrollment classes, a lot of high schools are offering them now a day, I was able to graduate high school with 47 college credits by simply doing college courses over high school courses (and believe it or not I found them much easier to do, I attended a free ""college prep"" ""private"" high school) and found my classes extremely challenging, so instead I started taking most of my classes at community college through my high school for literally 10$/credit. I realize not all high schools have this option, but if you do, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take advantage of it. This is an easy and cheap way to get general electives out of the way for college, and finishing high school at the same time, and it quite literally made high school easier for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- People who don't know what they want to major in**

This happens ALL THE TIME, people have no idea what they want to do, so they just attend a university as undeclared or as some random major that they end up switching 5 times in two years, if this is you, GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, because all you're going to be doing is general electives and classes at your full university for 5x the price. You can do all of this, at community college, probably live at home, work a part time job, and really think about what you want to do before making any major decisions. It truly makes sense. 

(**THE ABOVE ADVICE WORKS THE SAME WAY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO MAJOR IN, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE DOING GENERAL ELECTIVES FOR THE MOST PART OF YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF UNIVERSITY, JUST DO THEM AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE)**

&amp;#x200B;

**- DON'T FEEL PRESSURED INTO GOING TO UNIVERSITY**

I have seen this so many times people feel absolutely left out that all their friends are leaving for some university, and they don't want to be the odd man out who doesn't end up going.  DON'T let your emotions get the best of you, this isn't about your friends, or your high school reputation (that no one cares about) this is about you and your financial future, don't get confused why you're going to college. 

Don't get yourself in debt for the sake of feelings, don't worry about anyone else but yourself. Odds are you're not going to know anyone that you went to high school with 3 months after you start college. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Don't go to community college or university: TRADE SCHOOL**

For some people they feel as though they have no other option, this is simply untrue, trade schools exist for a reason, they're cheap and teach you a skill that can be used in the real world. I was on the fence on going to college simply because I absolutely did NOT like school, and my grades really showed that, but I did have a passion for the subject that I wanted to learn so I decided i'd like it better than the other options for trade school. But trade schools are by no means a bad thing at all. They exist for a reason. If you're going to go to college and get a learn a bunch of stuff that you don't like, you might as well just go learn a trade that you don't like for a fraction of the price and end up without crippling debt and a job! 

&amp;#x200B;

**- RESEARCH YOUR JOB PROSPECTS**

While college and higher education is there to continue your studies on a defined topic of your choice, if you're going into it with no money you MUST look at your job prospects, though I hate to say that you shouldn't go to college with the sole purpose of getting a fancy job, you should at least consider the opportunities you have after college in your field once you finish college. 

Unfortunately we're at a place where we have to treat college as an investment rather than a place to go learn regardless of the outcome, if you have all the money in the world and want to go study some weird obscure topic that has zero job possibility, thats totally fine. But this post is geared towards those who must treat college as an investment and NOT a luxury. 

High education will always be there, you can always go back, but you can't ever undo your college debt once you've signed for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- DO. THE. MATH.  LOOK AT ALL YOUR OPTIONS FOR YOUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOUR OPTIONS**

CONSIDER all your options in every university you can, look at all the data. Everyone wants to go to the school with the best program so they can get the best education, but the reality of the situation is,  its not at all feasible.  Unless you're getting financial aid and scholarships, its best just to choose the cheapest option, seriously. What you put into your education is what you'll get out of it.

We're at a time where we have everything available to us with a single google search. If you want to get the education of an MIT computer science student, you can do that, most of their lectures are posted on YouTube for FREE. THATS A FREE MIT EDUCATION, apply that with your normal classes at your University and you'll be a rockstar. Most companies want COMPETENT employees not fancy degrees. If you can prove your competencies and expertise on a subject in a job interview while someone with a harvard law degree cannot, they'll choose you any day of the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

**- REMEMBER WHY YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE**

SO MANY COLLEGES offer all these fancy dorms, gyms, campus coffee bars, etc. It looks awesome, living the american dream! But YOU WILL PAY FOR IT. That stuff doesn't come cheap and schools pass that cost right down to you. Don't fall victim to it, go to school for your education, not the fancy features that they give you. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 As someone who finished school with $20,000 in student loans, there are people who come out with 10x that who will never pay it off, people who will live pay check to pay check for the rest of their lives, don't do that to yourself. 

Be smart, be objective, do your own research. Don't feel pressured, don't be persuaded, do whats best for YOU. 

I know its hard when you're young and you don't think it'll be that big of a deal, and you'll be able to handle it. Even if that is the case, don't put yourself through that stress, its seriously unhealthy. 

No ones going to spoon feed you this information if they haven't already. You have to be ready to make your own decisions that'll affect you for the rest of your life. Do the research that it requires.

18,paperless38,1594175310,/r/college/comments/hn8niy/boyfriend_failed_classes_lost_his_scholarship_and/,"My \[F18\] boyfriend \[M19\] and I have been dating for about two years now, we both go to the same college and we just finished our first year. He has always struggled with motivation and discipline due to some mental health problems, but I am worried it is affecting his academic life and possible future career and I don't know what to do. 

Basically, I just found out that he failed two classes this semester, and his GPA went down to a 2.4 (he also failed a class first semester), he never told me himself because he was ashamed, I only found out because his college account is logged in on my computer. Since his GPA is so low, he lost his merit scholarship and is now on probation for the honors program that he is in. 

I know he had a rough time his first year, his mental health was at its lowest and I did everything I could to try and keep him on his feet, get him to go to class and do his work. But since we moved to online classes there really was nothing I could do to make sure he was turning in all the work, which is why he failed and his grades went down, because he didn't do any of the work. I try to be as patient and supportive as I can but it's honestly really sad and frustrating seeing him throw all his potential out the window. He is really smart, he was top of his class on HS but he can't focus or do work that he doesn't find ""interesting"" so he just neglects it. He is an undecided major so he's always saying that the classes are boring and that's why he can't bring himself to do the work. 

The thing that worries me the most is the scholarship, he lost a lot of money just because he couldn't get his act together and I don't know how he is going to make up for that money for next semester. 

I suffer from many different mental health disorders as well and I am by no means comparing my situation to his because we all deal with it in different ways, but I honestly can't comprehend why he is just throwing away such a good opportunity. He is attending a really good private school and he is drowning in loans to afford to pay for it and yet he's wasting all his time in nothing. He comes from a poor family, so a degree or a good education can take him so many places and I know he wants that but he just doesn't seem to care enough to work hard for it. All he seems to care about is playing videogames and smoking or getting drunk with his friends (no, he doesn't have a substance abuse problem), but I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I know I'm not his mom but I care about him and I want him to have a good future, but I really don't know how to help him.

He doesn't even know that I know all of this, I don't know how to bring it up. He chose not to tell me for a reason, but I want to help. What should I do? How can I help him? Has anyone ever experienced something similar and how did you or the person you were helping overcome it?

19,bluejedi24,1582955205,/r/college/comments/fb85vs/anyone_else_just_completely_burned/,"College has definitely not been a thrilling experience for me and I can't wait to be done. I've taken 5+ years to get my bachelor's because of interruptions due to needing to work, life events, and changing my major. I also never really felt like I fit in at my very large school since I despise party/Greek life culture. I used to be very introverted. Eventually I found a home in my major and got comfortable with life, but even then, my friends are all from different places, different clubs, etc. It's not like childhood or high school where you're in a highly structured environment where you bond with the same people over time and don't really have to worry about too much. College has made me feel very lonely and hopeless at times. Like I'm just attending to all my responsibilities without really getting anywhere or building anything.

I've had to go into a lot of student debt to get a college degree. For the beginning few years (starting in high school actually), I worked a lot to support myself, but that also meant I fell behind by 2 semesters because I had to work many 50-60 hour weeks. The last two years of college, I decided to work only during summer breaks and just take out the needed loans to finish up my degree and graduate ASAP, since I wanted to focus fully on my studies during the semesters. So the good news is that I graduate in May with a very good academic record. The bad news though is I was essentially just kicking the can down the road financially; living off of loans knowing they're just going to be waiting for me after graduation. If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would've started at community college or joined the military instead first.

I'm just sick and tired of sitting in a lab room clicking in programs and typing code for hours and hours every day, forgoing a good diet and healthy habits. I'm sick of interacting with people for just a few minutes each day but not being able to really grow with people because we all have different schedules and live different lives. I'm sick of living in my 3-person apartment off-campus where my one roommate is a disgusting slob. I'm sick of being highly financially stressed and thinking about how I will have to pay back debt for years and years. I am absolutely sick of the college ""bubble."" I feel like I've lost a healthy mind. It has stripped a lot of feeling and emotion from me to the point where I just feel like an empty pawn in a huge simulation. I've inadvertently forgotten that life shouldn't always be about chasing specific goals, or meeting academic or professional requirements, or submitting applications, or fulfilling others' expectations; you also have to remember to invest in fun things that simply make you happy. And I mean really simple things, like spending time with a family member, or reading, or going on bike rides.

I miss playing sports and being highly active and competitive. I miss genuinely bonding and growing with people like you do in childhood. I miss traveling for pleasure (can't when you're broke). I miss being able to smile and laugh regularly and actually mean it. I miss my family. I miss feeling valued and like I belong.

My degree is a ""wider"" degree than most; it has many applications, but I've never been able to say to myself ""This is exactly what I want to do with my life."" So I currently have no definitive plans for right after graduation, and you know what? That's fine. I'm also limited by the fact that I can't afford to just move to a new place and get going without any support.

So my plan is to go back home, at least temporarily, and just take some time to really figure out what I want to do with myself. I can work whatever local job I can find and live at home with Mom temporarily while I reset myself. Figure out what I need to do with my life to make it enjoyable and meaningful again as an adult. And then start working towards whatever that vision is. I look forward to saying goodbye to college and goodbye to many of the people in it. I'll try to maintain contact with a few friends and acquaintances who I genuinely do value, but I promise you that's not many.

20,skybluesky_,1582613690,/r/college/comments/f96ake/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_with_my_life/,"My parents are really smart. Both went to Ivy League schools. I somehow didn't inherit their intelligence but I went to a competitive high school and was able to pull off a decent ACT score and get into BU (after my parents proofread everything on my common app). But now here I am, a sophomore STEM major, and I don't really think I can handle it. My GPA is just hovering right around a 3.0 and I don't want to give up on my classes. But I keep getting Ds in classes everyone says are the easier ones and I just feel like I really can't do it. Some people have to be weeded out. The issue is that if I tried to switch now there's no way I'd be able to graduate in two years like I planned and I can't afford to go here longer than I have to. I'm not a hard worker but my major is decently interesting and there's no other major I'd rather do here anyway. I've also lived in the Boston area for my entire life and most of my friends and family live here or pretty nearby, but none of my family is from here and I deeply feel like an outsider. I'm dying to move somewhere else, but I have no idea how I'd afford it or where I'd go because I have no idea what career I want or could get after college (I'm not premed). I barely know anyone who lives in other cities so I'm terrified of being lonely and I have no experience with moving, but I just feel like I'm deeply not a New Englander. Honestly I don't really have much faith in getting a job after college. BU seems to be decently hard to get a good GPA, but still. I feel like it's hard to compete with people who have a better GPA. Also, my younger sister has dyslexia and my family might move so we can afford for her to go to private school. I know I'm so immature and selfish to be sad about this and this is what she needs, but secretly I've been fearing it so much since I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life and a lot of my best friends are still from my high school and it'd be hard to see them much again (I go home for breaks). I'm also in my first relationship and my boyfriend is way more into it than me which really freaks me out, but I can't bring myself to end it even if honestly some of the reason I'm still dating him is just to finally have a boyfriend and not be my stupid self people have looked down on my whole life (I do like him in the ways I should to some extent, which complicates things further). I'm worried long term I'll never be able to commit to someone and legitimately want to spend all my time with them more than anyone else since I like hanging out with a group of friends the most, but at the same time I want to get married and not be alone my whole life. I'm doing way too much stuff- balancing schoolwork with three clubs (no leadership), exercise, a volunteer position, an on campus job I can choose my hours for, trying to apply for summer internships I likely won't get, my relationship, seeing a bunch of friends that aren't all friends with each other, and still seeing my family semi-regularly/helping with my ten year old sister since I'm not very far from home. And I have terrible time management skills so I waste half the day away when it's incredibly important. I know I need to quit something, but there's nothing I can really quit. Here it is, almost 2 AM, I'm trying to make up the hours I said I did for my job last week, I flaked on my boyfriend today, and I have an 8AM chem lab tomorrow I haven't done the prelab for or last week's postlab. I just failed my orgo exam I crammed for and I'll have to lie to all my smart friends in the class as usual so they don't know how stupid I really am. I don't even know what I'll tell my parents. The worst part is that I know these are all such first world problems and I was given so much opportunity that I don't deserve when a lot of people don't get to go to college (I sound like such a shitty person in this but I really do care about other people and I see myself as worse than the average person), and I'm going to throw this expensive tuition away my parents are killing themselves to pay for away and never get a job and live with them until they die and then who even knows. I might seem like I have low self esteem, but I think I have reason to. I was born without any real talents in an area of success and I don't belong here at all. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for going on and on and this is probably normal for a 19 year old to be unsure of their future, but I just feel like I'll be a total failure (you can probably tell by now interviews aren't going to save me). If anyone has any idea of how I could possibly turn any aspect of my life around, that would be much appreciated.

21,JadeGreenleaves,1581817026,/r/college/comments/f4jfc1/im_running_out_of_money_for_college_what_should/,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit, so I apologize for any mistakes. Also, this is going to be a long post, so bear with me!

Here's my situation:

I'm a 20 y/o college student on my 4th semester. I currently live on campus with my twin sister. Our parents make too much money for FAFSA to offer us any aid besides small loans but they cannot afford to put any money towards our education. This mean we're paying out of pocket for the entirety of our expenses. 

We lived at home our first semester and worked almost full time while taking a full course load. I'm working toward my BFA, which requires a huge amount of studio time outside of class. By the time I would get out of class and home for the night, I'd have no time to work on my projects before I had to be awake at 3:30am for work, then school the next day. This situation was greatly reducing my academic performance and extremely stressful. Work was very understaffed so I got a ton of hours. Despite the stress, I was able to make and save a lot of money.

Since then, we've been sharing a room on campus in the cheapest available housing. We come home on the weekends to work, so we have a fraction of the hours. Living on campus has been an absolute necessity for me as I need access to programs, materials, and studio space that I only have on campus. I spend around 27 hours a week (9 per studio class, I'm taking 3) outside of class, which is standard for art courses. 

This setup has been great for my schoolwork, but horrible on my finances. This year has been full of unexpected expenses. For example, I suddenly lost a $1000/sem scholarship due to taking under 15 credit hours this semester. This was something I wasn't warned about and hadn't been enforced or mentioned until this semester.

The nature of my degree is extremely expensive as well. I've spent almost 2k in supplies and framing this year alone. I would have been able to manage this if it hadn't been for the loss of my scholarship. 
I will also need a car in the near future. I share one with my twin right now, which makes having a separate job/life complicated.

My current job is my first out of high school. I've been a great employee, and my boss has worked around my school schedule. However, I only make $8.75/hr which isn't sufficient to pay my expenses. A substantial raise is highly unlikely as the business is small and family owned (not my family). We are no longer understaffed, which means will have reduced hours this summer, which I cannot afford.

I need a higher paying job, but I don't know of one that will work around my schedule once summer ends.

I don't know what to do from here. I'll barely be able to pay for this semester, but I have no idea what to do in the fall. 

I've worked extremely hard to get this far and I don't want to give up. I'm passionate about my major and I've kept a 4.0 gpa despite everything. I'm worried taking a semester off will set me back and may sever my connections. 

I'm frustrated to be in this situation. I worked hard through high school to get good grades and a good ACT score, I've kept a perfect GPA through college, I have a job and go to the cheapest school in the state. Despite everything I still can't afford school. I'm not giving up, but it's crucial I make the best decisions I can moving forward. 

Does anyone have any advice? I'm open to any options you guys can think of. I've been avoiding taking out a private loan because I'm trying to graduate with as little debt as possible. At this point, it may be worth it.

22,Jam3sConn3r,1578774830,/r/college/comments/enctwm/a_reminder_to_say_thank_you/,"My father is a good man. He is the best man I know, and I am immeasurably lucky to have had him guide me to where I am now in life, which is a freshman at a great university. He also went to college. He worked two jobs to pay for it himself while maintaining a good enough GPA to apply to law school, in which he also worked multiple jobs. I don't work while at school, but I do 40 hours a week in the summers. My father grew up poor. Really poor. Hispanic kid in 60s California and Illinois trying to make ends meet poor. 11 siblings that all ate the same thing every day and didn't complain because they knew how hard their parents worked to put food on the table poor. I grew up asking for ten bucks to drive through Culver's with my friends. I grew up asking for something else if the dinner he made me wasn't what I wanted. My dad worked from 6 am to 8 pm picking cucumbers in 80-degree heat when he started middle school. I got my own laptop when I started sixth grade. My dad works long days, sometimes six days a week, at his office and has prosecuted more cases than most of his coworkers combined over his career. I go to frat parties and get so drunk that I have to go the hospital. I woke up this morning in the ER with an IV winding its way down my arm and my clothes in a bag behind the bed I was in. I loathe myself. My father brought me up strong, showed by example what a man should be, raised up good men in my eyes, and talked about his love for God so strongly that when I was young that I wanted to be a priest. Sometimes, when the world seems very quiet to me, I like to take a moment to remember the stories he'd tell me of the amazing people he has been blessed to work with over the years. He would talk of the judge, an old Irish catholic from Boston with a presence bigger than the room. How he would talk, and everyone would listen, hanging on each syllable, even the men standing before him accused of murder or violent sex trafficking or drug running, they all stood before him enrobed in the thoughtful cadence of his voice as he doled out wisdom from his seat. He talked of things like justice, yes, every judge should, but he also talked of compassion, of thoughtfulness, of honor, of strength of character and mental fortitude. He sat on the bench as a judge, but he stood before the room as a man, a model of what one should strive to be. He loved his wife dearly for over forty years and always took the time to shake your hand, look you clearly in the eye,  address you as sir, and ask you how you were, even the young men who came before him accused of heinous acts received the same solemn dignity that I did when I came in to watch my father work on warm summer days when my daycare wasn't open. He died last year. Pancreatic cancer. He fought it till the end, but the end was bitter. I won't soon forget how my father cried for this man. All my father said to me when he got back from the funeral was, ""He was a good catholic, but a better man."" My father worked many cases that this judge presided over and they were good friends in private, he was almost a second father to my old man. My dad's real father died when I was in third grade. Alzheimer's. I had never met him. My father's side of the family lived in Texas and for some reason we had never visited. That was the first time I saw my father cry. It broke me. He spoke at the funeral, between quiet, reserved moments of thought. That was the first time I had ever truly paid attention when my dad told stories about growing up. He talked about his father's life. Making a living during the depression, fighting in the second world war, raising 11 children on a car factory worker's salary. Teaching his children the value of their faith and each other. Never letting them forget the value of a dollar or a dream. Showing the resourcefulness of an eighth-grade education and the passion of an immigrant with a belief in the ideals of America. I could tell from the way the room was packed that this man was more than just a father. That was what I thought then, but remembering my old man speaking through teary eyes before his family, I now realize the man laying in the casket before him was exactly that: a father. He was the very best thing a boy could have. A father, a giant, a pair of calloused hands tucking you into bed after they worked a 14-hour shift placing the door on new model Chryslers they could never afford. A man who smacks you across your ear when you talk to loud in church and a man who picks you back up after you fall trying to learn to ride the secondhand bike he saved up for 3 months to get you. The sort of man you spend your whole life trying to grow up into, but always feel like you're coming up just short. The sort of man I hope someday my kids might be able to look to, and the sort of man my father is to me. But I let that man down yesterday and the shame and guilt are almost more than I can bear. But they were also a choice I made, and my father raised me up to own the choices I make. Laying on that bed in the middle of the ER I felt like dying. Not from the alcohol or from the embarrassment of the bad choices I made suddenly flooding to the front of my mind as I started to remember the previous night, not even from the thought of the bill that was inevitably coming in the mail. Those were all my choice and things that I could and will own. No, I dreaded more than anything the thought of telling my father, the man whose eyes filled with tears dropping me off at one of the best universities in the world because I now had ""the opportunities he never did"" and who was so proud to be able to pay for my tuition that he had saved for so that I ""wouldn't have to work the same crumby night shifts at the CVS"" like he did. How could I do this to my old man, who had given up so much for me. The same man who stayed up late hours to help me with my math homework after work so that I could get into that summer program. The same man who never missed a single one of my stupid tennis matches and coached every basketball team I was ever on. The same man who quietly drove me home after bad losses because he knew the music just made me angrier. The same man who spent what felt like years teaching me how to cast a rod only to see me give up after I got no bites in the first fifteen minutes. He is a colossus and I spent my childhood living in his loving shade. Now as I stare at the yellow patient ID bracelet on my hand, part of me can't help but smile. Not because I'm proud of what I did, there is no redeemable aspect of my actions and this I know. I smile because I know just how much my father loves me, and just how much I love him. I began writing this because I didn't have an outlet to put my emotions, a thousand miles from my home. I thought I understood how I felt and that the phrase ""I want to die"" pretty much encapsulated it. Now, more than anything, I want to live. To live to be the man my father wants me to be, to be the type of man I want to be. I'm still racked with conflict in my mind: sadness, regret, self-pity, disgust, and anger are all swirling through my thoughts. I'm still terribly afraid of the disappointment I know my father will feel. But I am strengthened by knowing I am my father's son. His love has always been my armor in this world, and it has enabled me to do great things. As I leave the world he prepared for me and start my life outside of his influence I am comforted by the knowledge that he raised me with every ounce of effort, courage, compassion, and conviction that he had, and, that while I will inevitably make mistakes, including many bad ones like last night, I have what I need to pick myself up, dust off my shoes, adjust the saddle and get back on the horse. No matter how many times it throws me. Now, I don't know if I will ever find the time or courage to show my father this, but I hope after you read this you can take some time to reflect on how much someone in your life has given you. Take the time to appreciate the small things they may do for you every day or the things they do for you without knowing it themselves. I hope you read this and feel like maybe you too can stand on the shoulders of giants like my dad, or your dad, or your mom, or your older brother, best friend, neighbor or cousin. We all have giants in our lives who raise us up to more than we thought we could be. Finding yours is important, but maybe more important is standing tall for others and making room on your shoulders for someone else's giant.

worked my ass off in high school all four years- varsity athlete (specialized in soccer from age 4 on with college dreams but was deterred with devastating knee injuries), all AP's, top 5% of my class, enjoyed volunteering and had strong extracurriculars with got stellar grades on top but because i'm in the mid to upper middle class my expected family contribution was way off the margin of what my family could actually afford- at every school i got into. got no scholarships to any schools at my desired level of academics. i can't say i wasn't frustrated seeing old classmates receiving majority scholarships to schools i would have died to go to... was the only person at my high school who got into my dream school and it was just too much of a financial burden on my family. 

thus, i ended up at an unchallenging commuter school that i have really had a horrible experience at, solely for financial reasons, and it's worse than high school. on many levels i'm lucky i'll graduate debt free, however i can't help loathing the fact that i've missed out on so many opportunities, friendships, experiences, etc.. i feel like i've regressed more than i've grown. 

waiting to graduate at this point.

I'm from a pretty well off family (i.e. we can afford to pay my private college full price, but obviously not easily), but for obvious reasons, I can't rely on them forever, and college has racked up some serious costs for them. I have jobs over the summers that pay a few thousand, and have been trying for merit-based scholarships (bc there's no way we can qualify for need-based). 

I can't seem to get a single scholarship. I have good grades (3.92 cumulative GPA w/ a 4.0 in my major), what I consider to be pretty good experience for someone at my level in my field, and good references. I didn't get anything from the Goldwater Scholarship (super prestigious STEM scholarship for undergrads I was nominated for) and for some reason, I was destroyed by it. I also recently lost out on a smaller scholarship, but that one I didn't care much for (a different story entirely). 

So now it's time for me to apply to grad school, which means fellowships. The rejection from the Goldwater stings like hell and now I'm here paralyzed and unable to write or think about science at all. I'm applying to things like the NSF-GRFP (which I know I have a 99.98% chance of rejection) and obviously will be competing with other applicants for funding at each school.

26,rolenoakenbow,1561018392,/r/college/comments/c2tcos/i_dont_want_to_study_engineering_but_feel/," Let me start this off with some contextualization. I come from a heavily conservative Indian family, which means that while growing up, my parents have constantly been telling me that I need to study either medicine or engineering. From the moment I hit middle school, I faced a constant bombardment of IIT-JEE prep courses and general railroading towards the engineering world, especially as both of my parents are computer engineers. The catch? I've never been even remotely interested in medicine or engineering. From a young age, I've excelled at debate, which honed my research skills, analytical thinking, and policy exposure. I've always known that I wanted to do something along those lines, but growing up in South India, that was always out of the question.  


After my sophomore year of high school, we moved to the US, and boy did it hit me like a breath of fresh air. I was introduced to a land of endless possibilities, and families that were supportive of their children no matter what field of study they entered. I was enamored, and began to think that maybe I may have a chance to study what I wanted. So one day my junior year I summoned enough courage and told my parents I wanted to study government, with a focus on environmental policy.  


I was ridiculed and branded delusional for even bringing up such ideas. Liberal arts are for white kids, they said. What's this about you not liking math? That's not acceptable. Stop debating and focus on your studies.  


When I began applying to college, I had the chance to apply to some very prestigious universities. My grades were great, I'd gotten 5s on all my liberal arts AP tests (think APUSH, AP Gov, AP Lang etc), and I had the extracurriculars to back me up. The moment I brought my idea to my father though, I was immediately shot down. ""If you want to study government, pay for it yourself,"" I was told. Things got to a head when he refused to pay my application fee unless I applied as a prospective mechanical engineering student. At the time, I was financially dependent on my parents for everything, and had little sense of independence. I put my head down, allowed myself to be bullied into submission, and said okay. Maybe engineering wouldn't be so bad, I told myself. Maybe I could study environmental engineering, and it would somewhat align with the goals I had envisaged for myself.  


My first year of college has been miserable. I managed to BS my way into a top engineering college on the East Coast, and I am struggling like I never have before. My grades have tanked because I am way out of my depth. Competing against kids who have studied multivariable calculus since the tenth grade and who are there because they want to be is both incredibly challenging and incredibly demoralizing. I feel like a fraud, and like there's nothing I can do in my situation.  


To make matters worse, my university is divided into individual colleges. To feasibly transfer into my university's College of Arts and Sciences (to study gov), I'd have to submit a formal transfer request, for which I have nowhere near the required GPA. My grades are in the dirt, and I've been placed on academic probation because I'm just not able to keep up academically. I'm lost, demotivated, and in a rut.  


I can't bring this up to my parents, because when I do, they give me the same stock responses, every time. ""Engineering is hard for everyone. This nonsense about government is just an escapist fantasy."" ""You're an arrogant, ungrateful child who can't appreciate the sacrifices we've made for you."" ""If you're too stupid for engineering, there are always minimum wage jobs looking to hire."" I cannot tell them that I have been depressed for the past three years, that I am absolutely miserable watching my friends live out their dreams elsewhere, that I feel guilty because maybe I am being ungrateful and throwing away a shot others would kill to have. But I don't know what else to do.  


I really want to study government, and I really want to work in the public sector dealing with environmental policy in the future. I'm not a bad student, either. I had straight As in high school, and got really high grades in my writing and singular environmental policy class in college. I'm passionate about the environment, about political theory and analysis, and about civic engagement. I've recently been looking at withdrawing from the College of Engineering and reapplying to my university's College of Arts and Sciences, but I'm terrified that my low GPA disqualifies me from consideration. I've been looking at external academic forgiveness program at other universities, but I'm afraid my parents will cut me off financially and I won't be able to afford college anymore.  


I'm terrified, you guys. What do I do?

-I do NOT qualify for FASFA. Only have once, and that was when my younger brother first started college 2 years back. Family makes *too much* and I'm only 23 still living at home and paying my own expenses. 

-I pay for my courses myself. 0 help from anyone or my parents at that(nothing new here). 

-I'm doing vocational school at this moment. 

I've decided to go back to school, and go back FT. I've earned my Associates 2 years ago and decided to wait on my Bachelors, due to financial circumstances. Instead of going to Uni, I decided to go back to my former community college and earn a certification in Electrical work(very similar to my college major), which is an 11 month program. 

Before I began school, I was working a nice FT office job and making a decent wage. I decided that's not what I wanted to do with my life. I saved up enough money to get me through the first semester of school, but that's only the first semester. 

The spring term has opened up for payments and is quickly approaching, but I have &lt;$400 in my savings right now. I've put my tuition on a payment plan and forwarded that plan to charge my Visa credit card at $335 a month for 4 months(this was for fall). Spring is going to be the same price with the exact same payments, but I'm afraid I cannot afford it. 

My current PT job is complete crap, and I'm looking for a second job. If I can find a second job by the time payments are due, then I'll be able to afford the payments no problem, but at this moment in time I cannot.

Scholarships. Let me just say, they're just like playing the lottery, but for free. I've applied for one and just got informed I did not win anything. I'm looking for others, but it's not as easy as I expected it to be. They all have specific requirements that have to be met, and I can't lie and say I have those requirements(live in X state, be X age, be this, etc). All the ones for my state, I keep getting denied because of my qualifications for FASFA are not met. 

Now I've looked at loans in the past, but I have never been a fan of them. The amount I'd need to make it through the next 8 months would only be $3,000, but I don't know how that would work out. I don't want to be charged hefty interest rates and I want to pay it back while I'm still in school. What to do??

28,Vanilla_Vaporeon,1537209471,/r/college/comments/9gn00k/my_senior_year_feels_like_a_nightmare/,"I am in a very stressful situation right now because of my parents. I thought my senior year was supposed to be exciting and fun, but it is a total nightmare. They are hurting my mental health and my relationship with my bf, and I feel lost. Long story short my parents are divorced and do not get along at all. My family is completely fucked. My dad is very wealthy, and I do not like being around him since he is very narcissistic and can be abusive. (He is also involved in scientology but I won't get into that right now). He now tries to be a good dad by sending me money every month while I am a student. The only rule is that I have not been allowed to have a job while he gives me money.

 I am very grateful for this money, but the problem is that neither of my parents have really been helping me pay for school. Previously I have been secretly saving some of the money I get from my dad to pay off my loans later that my mom had set up for me, but I had to use it all up for this past year's tuition. It is my last semester of my senior year now, and my tuition has not been covered... AGAIN. I told my mom about it, and she told me that she ""forgot"" to set up loans for me or financial aid or whatever and its past the due date, but previously she had told me I don't qualify anymore since she got remarried to another rich guy. She basically told me its not her problem and to figure it out myself. My dad did pay for my summer internship class this past semester, but my parents had a huge fight about it first. He also just paid for a new laptop for me that he is forcing me to pay him back for, so I have a strong feeling he will say no to helping me and have another horrible fight over the phone with my mom, and my mom will probably resent me for it if he gets verbally abusive again. So now i'm scared I'm not going to make it to graduation.

On top of all this, I had to move out of my apartment because of a bad roommate, and my mom told me to move back home. It has really put a strain on my relationship with my wonderful bf of 3 years too, since I lost some of my freedom to be with him whenever I want. We even secretly lived together for a year too and it was amazing. Anyway my mom is now always upset at me about little things that aren't even my fault most of the time, and wants me to pay rent. I would be fine with that, but my dad has started giving me way less money than usual every month so that she won't get any more of his money than the child support for my sister he barely pays. 

I really don't know what to do and my anxiety is just getting worse and worse. I am almost always crying about it if I am alone too long... especially when I need to be working on my artwork for my senior art show. My bf and I have been talking about moving into an apartment together after I graduate. Then I can get out of this mess of a family and hopefully go to grad school for my masters in graphic design, but I still have to make it another few months until then, and idk if I can even afford that... my mom also says she is totally on board with us moving together since she ""can't afford my lifestyle"" (whatever that means), even though she also always makes a point to tell me to NEVER marry him.  Its like even though my mom says she agrees, she also makes me doubt it will even work out by saying things like how my bf is not who she would have picked for me (what is this, the 1500s?) and how it will suck when we break up and are stuck living together. I know that is a possibility but it sucks that she has no faith in us, or anyones relationships really. She also just told me she asked my dad over the phone what he thinks about me and my bf living together and he said he does not approve at all and would cut off all money for me.

I am feeling completely lost right now and I don't know what to do anymore.  My parents are too selfish to help me with anything, but at the same time try to control me to the point where I feel every decision I make is wrong. I am just trying to graduate and be an adult and a professional artist, but I also have to deal with all this garbage. I am now terrified for my future and my parents are making me feel like I am suffocating.

So, my tax return got messed up and it turns out my university never got my tax info. My parents got our family accountant to re-submit my tax return a few days ago, but it will take the IRS a few weeks to process it and then it will take my university a few more weeks to process and a few more to put together my financial aid package. All of that needs to be done by August 20th, when my tuition is due. I definitely can't afford to pay the amount it would cost, and basically I won't be able to go to class this semester (or potentially the entire school year) if this stuff doesn't get done in time.

I have contacted the financial aid office, but they said that getting an extension on the deadline is unlikely and to contact them closer to August 20th to see if I can get one.

If I can't go to class, I'd like to be able to get an internship instead. I had been contacting a company about an internship for this past summer, which fell through, but they had asked if I was available for the fall. I said I wasn't because of classes, but I could contact them and see if they have any positions available.

Should I start contacting companies and applying for internships/jobs now? I'd hate to wait and not be able to get an internship if it turns out I won't get financial aid, but I also don't want to suddenly turn down a company if I do get financial aid. I especially don't want to have a poor relationship with the company I had contacted before, since they are in a convenient location and a professor had recommended that I contact them. Also, should I explain to them why I won't be taking classes this year?

If it helps, I was an engineering major this past year but I had switched to industrial design and computer graphics technology (3D modeling, basically) for this year.

30,JereBear_2281,1531151641,/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure this is the right place for this but I'm going to try.

I need some help, and it's a long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. 

I just finished my freshman year of college, and now I'm worried that I won't have enough financial aid to ride out until the end of my education. I come from a family that is very mixed in it's financial status, as in my father was making absolute bank until he lost his job in 2009 due to mass layoffs which effectively ruined my parents lives, but he's also in consideration for a job that'll pay around $85,000 a year, so that would put them, and possibly by extension me, in a very good financial situation. But I've learned that when planning things it's always best to prepare for the worst, so let's just forget I mentioned that potential new job lol 

Anyways, the college I attended for the 2017 - 2018 school year cost roughly $22,000 a year with room and board, which is a necessity as it's a three hour drive from where I live. So, considering that my degree would require me to attend for five years, that'll roughly be a grand total of $110,000, and I just found out that an undergrad, who is still a dependent, can only take out up to$39,000 in government student loans. About $11,000 of that was used this past year, with grants/free aid covering the rest besides another $5000 that slipped through the cracks, which my parents ended up covering by taking out a loan that they can't afford. So that leaves me with a maximum of $28,000 in government loans and whatever grants and other free aid I get offered to cover $88,000 of college tuition. Now, looking back at how my financial aid for 2017 - 2018 worked out, and considering that my EFC went up a ton just because my sister moved out, my Higher Education award, which everyone gets, has dropped from $5000 to a little over $2000, things aren't looking very good there. Oh, and there's also the issue of your student loan eligibility decreasing every year that you're in school(I haven't fact checked that myself, buy I remember a financial advisor telling me that). 

Also, I've also been an average to slightly below average student when it comes to subjects that aren't within my interest, no matter how hard I work. All the way from 1st grade to my freshman year of college, if it wasn't related to music, art, writing or history, I would suck at it. This left me with a rather mediocre high school GPA, and things only improved slightly during my first year of college. So because of this, my odds of getting scholarships are slim to none, not to say that's kept me from applying, though. Oh, and because I'm a white male from an all white family, it seems like the entire college system assumes that I don't need any help and that I'm already at a much higher advantage than everyone else. Lol. 

So in terms of financial aid, things look pretty damn grim. There's also the option of using as much financial aid as I possibly can, and then applying for private loans, but there's no guarantee I would even get approved for them, and that would leave me at an absoluye, best situation, bare minimum of $50,000 in total debt, if I'm the luckiest person in the world. In reality it'd probably end up being closer to $110,000, maybe around $80,000. And I'm not sure that I want to take on all of that for a career that could write possibly pay sub-$30,000 a year starting out in a seemingly dying field. 

Which segways me into informing you that my current degree path is for a Music Education degree, which I would use to become a high school band director. As far as I'm aware, the only true passion I've ever had was for high school marching band, and to a lesser extent concert band. I never really had any other activities or groups where I felt like I belonged. I tried a couple different sports and a few different clubs, but none of them resonated with me. But I loved marching band and I excelled there, having earned the highest ranks in student leadership within the program. Marching band gave me the same competitiveness factor that you could get from sports, taught me valuable lessons, and gave me an overall sense of purpose. That's why I want to become a high school band director; so I can keep doing what I love while also helping new young people find a passion for it.

Now that all sounds fine and dandy, but when you realize that a high school band director will probably make scraps starting out, sometimes even less than other new educators, and the fact that school systems have been cutting music programs from public school curriculum for a while now, and are still doing so, it starts to seem like a much less viable and worthy option to out $80,000 worth if debt towards, even if it is my passion. There's also the fact that my main drive for this is for the love of the music meets competition aspect, and I'm not sure if someone who is only in it for the competitiveness should be teaching students. 

Although this is my only passion that I've discovered, I'm aware that it's not my only option. Hell, I never even considered that a life-long career. My plan was to ride that out until I was 50 or so and then start my own instrument sales and music lesson business. So keeping that in mind, I've also been toying around with the idea of going to a more local college that I can drive to everyday and pursuing a business management degree with a minor in music. Other interests and skills that I'm not sure what to do with are good-great writing skills, pretty okay visual art skills(mainly drawing), and being totally okay with doing hard work with my hands, getting dirty, and just doing ""tough guy"" work in general. I've also always enjoyed creating things and using my imagination. 

So what do I do? Do I follow my only real passion and try to attain that, even though I know I could be cut short and ruined financially before even attaining my goals? Or should I look for something else that I can pursue that matches my other skills and interests? I just feel so lost and confused right now.

Thanks for any help! 

Edit: Should probably mention that less than 10 colleges in my state offer Music Ed, and they're all at least two hours away, and none of my family leaves near any of them.

Edit edit: Just found out the maximum a dependent undergrad can be offered is $31,000. Yay, even worse.",college,Any Advice On My Situation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8xcy1m/any_advice_on_my_situation/,1531169641.0
31,f0sters5,1523489981,/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,"Hey guys. This might be a long story so I apologize, and thank you, in advance.

Anyway starting in high school, neither of my parents ever went to school, and neither really believed in it. I was never pushed to do good in school, and never encouraged to pursue higher education. Just before I graduated, the two of them had a very long, drawn out and dramatic divorce. I had just gotten out of a relationship where I had been cheated on. I stopped caring about anything and lost myself in mindless things like video games.

I bounced around from pointless minimum wage job to the next, while also bouncing between parental households as they each kicked me out repeatedly, seeing me as a failure who would never amount to anything. I began to believe they were right.

Eventually I met another girlfriend, and got a decent paying job netting me about 20$ an hour. I was still unhappy, but things felt like they were starting to look up. Until I realized this was just another dead-end job in a warehouse that I was miserable breaking my back at everyday, and even that girlfriend ended up having cheated on me for over a year of our 2 year relationship. I went into a slight depression, stopped working hard at work, and lost that job because of it. Being a dumb 20 year old at the time making that sort of money, I got a credit card thinking it would help build my credit; and it did - until I lost that job and could never pay it back. Now I'm pretty sure my credit is abysmal and I'll never be able to buy a new car let alone a house.

After I lost that job, my mom kicked me out yet again, calling the cops and having them throw me out. I lived in my car in the freezing winter for almost 2 weeks before my dad let me come stay with him again - on the premise I enroll in school, which I did the next week. I was accepted soon thereafter, started working at my dad's business, and started going to school and doing well. I felt like my life was finally going somewhere.

Those first 2 semesters, I held a 3.8 GPA going for a business major. However there were still some things that were getting at me - I had little to no friends, my dad's new wife hated me and made me feel worthless all the time, and because of that my dad told me I was ruining his new marriage, and to top it off I didn't even know what I was going to school for outside of my parents telling me to so that I would simply have a place to live. I started skipping class, which was infectious and go to the point I would only go on test days. My GPA dropped but I was still passing my classes; until in the latter part of my second year, my dad's shop started to do really poorly - he couldn't afford to buy new supplies or things to sell, and he somehow blamed me for it. I was doing the best that I could. I still to this day don't know how he thinks it was my fault. He didn't even pay me to work for him. So thinking that it was my fault his shop closed down, he again kicked me out.

I used a bit of my financial aid loads to move into an apartment on the school campus. But again I became depressed, thinking my whole family hated me, I couldn't get a girlfriend that would ever love me and not cheat on me, that I would never have friends or a good job or even be able to get good grades. I started skipping to the point that I just stopped showing up to class altogether, and needless to say, failed most of them. My last semester there, I stopped going altogether and never went back. I ended with a sub 2.0 GPA and multiple failed classes. I now have about 25k$ in student loan debt without even having a degree to get a job good enough to pay it off with.

During the time I was at school and working for my dad, gave my mom a bit of time to realize I really was trying, and she began to become much more caring. She understood that I was really struggling and once more let me come stay with her. Thankfully she did, because while there I met my now fiance who went to a school nearby there.

Fast forward a few years, and me and her have decent stable jobs in a new town, in a new state. Along the way, I've found an all-encompassing passion for physics and astronomy, and feel for the first time actual drive to finish my schooling. It makes me regret everything I've done along the way besides meeting my fiance, and wish that I could do everything all over, but I can't. And now I sit here, wondering if its even possible to get a PhD in physics and astronomy with all the things I've done wrong compiled into my now life. Thinking that I might not ever to achieve that dream because of my many past failures makes me sometimes want to just end it all.

I don't even know where to begin to finish my studies - I know credible schools won't take me with the grades and attendance record I've gotten, and the community colleges around here either don't have the programs I'm looking for and even if they do, I don't know if they'll even add up to me getting a bachelor's from a reputable school since by next year I'll have 3 years worth of credits amounting to nothing; I have a sum of 2 years of business classes combined with extracurriculars, so would going to community college mean I'm starting all over? Let alone going on for a PhD somewhere even better. Why would anyone ever accept me with my record as a PhD candidate when as of now I'm pretty sure no one reputable would even consider me a BS candidate. Even if it was possible to line everything up perfectly, I wouldn't graduate with my PhD until I was almost 40. That in itself is discouraging enough.

So here I sit, lost, depressed, in debt with no degree and no foreseeable future that I can see lining up for myself because of my past mistakes and failures. I really need advice from anyone who can offer it. I finally found something in life I'm honestly 100% passionate about, and am so afraid its too late and that I've messed my life up beyond repair - please help me find how I can achieve my dream despite all the things I've done wrong in my life.",college,"Trying to get my life together at 26, and fear I might have messed it up too much already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8blqbt/trying_to_get_my_life_together_at_26_and_fear_i/,1523507981.0

She has had kind of a rough past and her family's house was evicted back a few years ago and they didn't have a place to stay and have no good family connections, her father never made it though high school and currently works side jobs/ handyman projects to try to make an income and her mother has a drug addiction and has been to rehab and is currently in prison on drug charges again but the father and the rest of the family are not involved in any drug relations. So back to the story they got evicted and ended up moving into a family friends place and the family friend has some mental issues and started verbally and physically abusing them and they had to leave due to that, then they started living in a RV on her step mom's property (forgot to mention it's just her, her father, and her two brothers living together (Freshman and Sophomore I believe)) and they were always doing their part to help pay for staying there and the electricity and water bills and all that stuff and obviously she's still in school so she can only work part time and her father can only get side jobs here and there so there is a small about of income but enough currently for bills and living expenses and her father has bad credit history so she managed to get her family a place of their own to stay under a program that helps family's with low income and stuff like that but she pay's for most of the bills and gets the groceries for the family and helps take care of her brothers and preparing meals since her dad is usually away at side jobs. But once she graduates the program that helped they get the house won't allow her to be living at the house or something about jacking up the prices or whatever since she would be counted as another adult once she graduates so money wise she can't live there after graduation and have her family afford to live there with her so she's basically forced to leave but still wants/needs to make sure her family is okay but at the same time she doesn't have like barely any money saved due to these situations, she needs to find a place to live of her own, she's still in school, she has like no credit history, has no friends who know how to help with all of these circumstances, the school isn't being any help, she's wanting to go to college to try to better herself and try to be able to make it in life but can't afford not to take at least a break year but then her scholarship apparently won't work if she takes a break year. She's just really scared and stressed out and I'm trying to be here for her and help her figure things out but like with all of these circumstances it's hard to figure out what the best thing(s) to do is.

33,StabilizedDarkkyo,1516679448,/r/college/comments/7sbp4z/is_there_still_hope_for_me_to_attend_college_long/,"I have attended three semesters of college as a degree-seeking student. I didn't fuss about it, but near the end of the semester, my family got an eviction notice that freaked me out like crazy, as my step-dad wasn't paying rent and was misusing our money. I was already struggling as these last few years of my life have been insane, but we were able to survive. Around that time my Mom and step-dad started their separation/divorce. It left me frazzled at the end of the semester, and I ended up getting an A, C, and D. Not terrible, but I got an academic warning. I told myself it was just me being lazy, and that the next semester I would do better.

Then, spring semester of 2017 came and life got insane again, even more so this time. My grandfather committed suicide by shooting himself in the face during spring break, my step-father attempted suicide multiple times from the beginning to end of the semester, my brother got put into inpatient treatment for suicidal activity, and we realized how screwed over we were financially from my stepdad's misuse of our money. Things became tight financially, so I continued my student job I started the first semester of school, but I noticed my performance had dropped significantly from the previous semester, both in school and work. I got an academic probation, seeing that my GPA dropped under a 2.0 to a 1.66. But I was able to get an airline ticket as a prize in a lottery at work, so I thought I'd be able to relax by seeing my father and his side of the family down in Michigan. Heck, the next semester would be great if I came back relaxed! So I booked a trip right before the fall semester started.

During summer, my stepfather overdosed on Ambien twice, strangled himself with a belt to passing out and tried suffocating himself with a bag. Finally, he was told to move out after he was hospitalized. This constant calling of 911 and being afraid there would be a dead body in our house kept everybody in the house on edge. Everybody was stressed, anxious, and terrified. Thankfully I was able to stay at another house for a couple days here and there when I needed to, but the stress still got to me. Then, during the trip to see my father, it turned out that he wasn't what we thought he was. I had brought my brother with me, and two days before we left, my father started verbally assaulting my brother over how he'd die if he were ever to be robbed, how my mother raised him wrong, how he would have raised us to be good christian children, how he wanted to take my little brother and force him to stay there. My father mocked him for having an online girlfriend, telling him he should be screwing every girl possible, told him that he was a pussy that needed to learn how to kill, and so forth. I hid in a room trying to stay away from the fight, but my stepmom dragged me out and started screaming at me at how i had told my mom that she was abusing my little brother, how I was totally conspiring against her when I was only 11. We later went to go on a boat ride, but on the way my step father screamed at us for being non-religious, that he was ashamed of us bieng his blood, that I was a pussy-footing failure, that neither of us woudl get anywhere in life, and finally that we better not tell our mother, as telling our mother would get him pissed off, and he told us that everybody that pisses him off would no longer exist on earth. So basically he threatened to kill us. So on the boat, my little brother called my mom while I kept a look out, and the next day our relatives in the town kept us away from our father as much as they could without raising suspicion. Then, past security at the airport we met up with my mother, where our father couldn't see, and went home. We were scarred from that, and we went to school full of stress and fright. I went to the counseling center at the university after breaking down when trying to tell my teacher what was wrong with me, but they said I was a bit too extreme to me and referred me to the psychological counseling center, who didn't accept me as I wasn't suicidal. So, I went to my former childhood therapist. My brother ended up dropping out. I got academically disqualified. 

I for some odd reason thought there was still hope that I could go to school this semester, but I wasn't able to. Turned out they removed me from the degree program, so I tried as a non-degree seeking student. Turns out that as a non-degree seeking student, I had no access to any of the loans or student aid I heavily relied upon, as my family has been spending pretty much every cent on the financial mess we were left in. I called the financial aid center and tried to see what I could do, and they said my only option was to go to class and pay out of pocket or go get a SAP appeal done. So, I emailed my academic counselor about it. This morning I got an email saying that I was pretty much removed from the university. The SAP appeal was only allowed for degree-seeking students, but seeing as how I became non-degree seeking a few days prior, I was disqualified from that. 

I have no financial way to go to college without begging for money from my father or getting a job, which would interfere with university especially since I can't even drive yet. So, I'll have to take the next semester or two off to raise up money to go to college, but my loans only give me a grace period of six months, so I am afraid I won't have enough money to go to classes before that is up. Is there anything I can do to still go to college, or do I have to just drop out for the semester and work until I can afford it again?


TL;DR A ton of screwed up shit happened during my last three semesters of college, and now I'm academically disqualified due to the mental stress this all caused me. I have no financial means of going to college. Is there still any hope of me going?",college,Is there still hope for me to attend college?

34,Potatopcakes,1508964585,/r/college/comments/78qnh6/serious_financial_issue_cant_afford_to_finish_my/,"Some background - I'm currently attending art school, studying graphic design, and I'm a junior. I recently moved closer to campus paying for my first ever apartment while juggling full time schooling and a part time job(3 days a week)

For over the past year, I've been seriously struggling with finishing my assignment on time and producing quality work because of a few things- suffering from major depressive episodes, anxiety(recently medicated/diagnosed), having to commute 1.5 hours to class every day prior to moving, financial issues, and a major shot to the self esteem because I haven't been proud of any of my work. I almost took a medical leave last year because I was falling behind so much, and I was also threatened with academic probation from the school.

This year, I lessened my course load a bit and it's helped, and living closer has also helped, but I'm still falling behind. I recently had to quit my previous job unexpectedly because it was one of the major factors cutting into my assignment, I had to commute 40 minutes to get there and they weren't great about working around my school schedule so I didn't even have a day just to dedicate to homework. On top of that I'd be exhausted from standing for 8 hours. This was a bad move on my part, but I was positive that i'd be able to find something much closer in a short period of time. I was able to find another job within a week, but I had to get background checks/drug tests, and it took a couple weeks for everything to come back so with bills coming in I depleted all of my funds. Currently my bank account sits -$300+ and I've just been feeding my paychecks to my balance with no way to pay for food or gas. 

which puts me in my next issue- I have to have a major assignment printed and put together by tomorrow morning and I've been just waiting for my new credit card to come in the mail so I can pay for it somehow but it has yet to come in. (It's been about a week- I had to get a new card because it got compromised) So here I am, last minute, freaking out because Its the night before and I have nothing printed. For me to print everything would be about $20 roughly and I can't even afford that. I'd ask for help but if my family sent me the money it would just get eaten by my gaping bank account balance. 

I've already confided in this professor a couple weeks ago about the issues I've been having but I was certain by now I would've had everything figured out. I should've emailed her earlier this week but I was positive I'd have money by now. I've been behind on this assignment pretty much from the beginning and I feel really bad because I don't want it to seem like I'm purposefully putting off the assignment. I'm having a pretty bad panic attack thinking about having to do a presentation tomorrow and literally not having anything to show for the second time on the same assignment. 

I want to email her tonight even though she most likely won't see it before class tomorrow- what should I say?

I quit while in my junior year. I moved back to Northern California to my home town. Im still dating the same guy because he and I love each other he says he will do anything for me. Now I have the option of continuing my education in my hometown at a junior college which is much cheaper because that's what my parents agreed they will pay for. Or I can continue going to private school/any school in LA however my parents will NOT help me pay for it. So I feel like my options are: take out loans and be in the student debt circle but that means getting to stay with my boyfriend, or, stay in my hometown so my parents can pay for my school while I earn and save some money. This isn't an easy option however because my boyfriend is living/working in LA and we had a life there, an apartment we were moving into. He even says he will help pay for the debt or any school I need even community college as long as it means I'm back in LA with him.

36,biteszadusto9,1506302074,/r/college/comments/72992t/transferring_in_the_fall_after_freshman_year_im/,"I feel like I have made a terrible mistake in picking this college, I only went because it was cheap, and couldn't afford to go to UIUC, which was my best safety school. My tuition would have been free this semester, if not for the freshman living on campus rule. The school I am attending is very small, with only a few thousand people, and there's not a lot of activities or stuff to do on campus. Despite this, it couldn't be that bad, could it?


 Believe me, I tried to keep a positive atittude and was really excited about starting college and trying to make friends. However, I have autism, and it's a crucial part of my identity and my lifestyle, so I got in contract with my school's disability office to talk about accomadations for this school year. Big mistake. They argued with me about living off campus or having a single room, and told me the school needs money, so freshman have to live on campus. I have a math learning disability as well, and am in the process of more comprehensive testing to really ""prove it"" , but it was established that I really struggle in the subject. The only accomadation I got was more test time, and so far, I haven't even gotten that in my class. I was told that my school loves diversity, but it seems like they view me and my disorder as a hassle more than anything. 



I also had to fight them for a parking pass to go to my doctor's appointments, and they're making me park in a lot 2 miles off campus because I can't park where the upperclassman are, which is bullshit and has made me late so many times, because I can't scheduele my doctors appointments at an earlier/later time. I refuse to miss class. So far I've gotten multiple parking tickets, most of them for not knowing where to park because I was never told where the lot was and its not on the map, and they told me it was my fault. I've been told to just deal with living in the dorms  by everyone with the exception of the school doctor and councelor, who have put me on anxiety medication and are making me go to therapy every week to try and cope with being here. I tried living in my dorm and couldn't handle it cause of people and noise, so they switched my room to a suite that I share with other people, who completely ignore me and make me feel even more unwelcome there. I just quit staying in my dorm and am staying off campus in the place I share with my friend for free, in exchange for driving her to the bus so we can go to class.


Also, since I had to pay for a meal plan, I eat in the cafeteria most of the time and I saw someone who had no meals left, and swiped my card for them. The lunch lady at the register pulled me aside and told me I was never to do that again, or they would confiscate my card. I nearly cried. This school makes me incredibly nervous and rigid, and I haven't made any friends here at all. All of the clubs I would be interested in meet late at night, like video game and anime clubs, so I never have the energy to go. I've tried to form a club for autistic people but can't get it approved, and have tried everyday to sit in the disability center in the library to meet more people I can relate to, but with no luck. I'm trying sports, but I'm very uncooridinated and bad at talking, so I tend to ramble or make comments every two seconds, and I don't fit it at all on my incredibly small, tight knit club team. I don't fit in at this school in general either. Most of the campus is vegan and I get lectured my strangers about how eating meat is animal abuse. Like really, what the fuck? People write things like ""Violence is the answer. Violence is a necessity"" all over the sidewalks and that is allowed and often encouraged. One girl was pitching a fit on the bus about misgendering animals and how that's important, and as a trans person, I wanted to deck her for saying something like that. But no one at my school is interested in anything but politics, that's all most of the clubs or events are about, and a lot of the dicussions in my classes are about political stuff 90% of the time. You have to adapt the exact views of everyone else or you will not be accepted, or get bad grades for it. (Multiple people have told me this)


I am almost failing my Calculus class, failing both the first quiz and test. I've been going to tutoring at school and I'm going to get help outside of school, studying constantly, and meeting with my professor, but because my algebra skills are so poor, I can barely catch up. Yet, my professor thinks I shouldn't go back to precalc because I took it last year. I've been in tears so many times because I feel like a failure, and despite making As in my other classes, I can't have that low grade affecting my GPA. I need to get out of here. My family and partner are telling me to just be strong and get through it, that I'm acting like a child and will adjust if I force myself to, but I've tried, and I can't stand it here. I want to transfer to clemson, a school closer to home, where I can live off campus and make more connections. (I know people in the area and have support, whereas I only have one person at my current school) I'm working on the application, but I really don't know about the process besides that, and who i need to contact to send paperwork and transcripts over. Can someone who has transferred before offer advice in this trying time?

I got accepted into Chapel Hill and NC State, decided to go to NC State due to a desire to do engineering. Everything was looking great, but literally my last day of school, my father was laid off. On top of this, we have been paying a mortgage for a house we don't even live in and can't sell, while also paying rent for our current house. Due to our extremely late taxes, even though I did my FAFSA, the verification process I was required to do took extremely long.

This leaves my family with about $5000-6000 to pay by the end of the month. We have nowhere near this amount. My father just finished the second round of interviews for a company in Ohio, and if he gets the job, my family will be moving to Columbus. In our current state, it is almost impossible for us to physically pay for college.

I am a 17 year old girl who's current plan is to go to college out of state. I am moving to the state where my college is and living with my mother who is already there (however I will not be receiving in state tuition, that's besides the point). The price is hefty (39,000 a year for tuition + room and board + personal expenses) and my both of my parents don't qualify for a Parent Plus Loan. The most money my family will get to pay for college is $5000. I've applied for scholarships and despite being a minority women going into the STEM field and being a first generation college student I did not win any of the scholarships I applied to lol. Anyways my point being is that paying for college is a problem for my family that we don't have a solution for.

I've already talked to my family about potentially not going to college this fall. It's not for sure since we're still looking at options as to how we're going to pay and potentially getting another family member to cosign the loan. Anyways I'm really considering taking a gap year and just working and volunteering. I would also like to do some tutoring too.

I want to make myself more productive and get more experiences. Also I'm young, very young for a graduating senior and freshmen in college. I'm not even an adult yet (and I won't be until this September) and I'm not sure I'm ready for the commitment of college. I've been struggling with depression and mostly very severe anxiety this past year also and I really want to do something with my life that will make me happy now that I'm done with high school and I have the freedom to do so.

However the cons of a gap year are what's preventing me from going through with this. While my plan is to work, volunteer, and be productive I know myself, and I know that I am lazy person. I can see myself falling behind and not keeping up with my own education. I am afraid that I will miss out on an education and this gap year will turn into 2 years and I just won't end up going to school. I was also thinking about taking a semester off or so after my first two years of college, which I read was beneficial to some. I really do not want to go to a CC because I really want the freshmen experience at a college and I don't want to transfer in as a junior anywhere. I feel like if I took a gap year it'd be alright because I would be the age of most of the kids coming in.

Anyways thanks for reading that and as you can see I'm really conflicted. This has been a subject of stress but I know things are going to work out for me. I would just like other opinions.

It's not that I don't pay attention, because I do, but it just seems like they're trying to teach us the things our high school teachers couldn't. I can't comprehend lessons (especially math) in my classes. I've tried getting tutoring but they just get annoyed with trying to teach me these things and eventually just start doing the assignments for me. That's why I stopped my tutoring.

I did my research, saw the salary, job security, etc. I started my freshman year last fall and the new semester just started. Unfortunately for me, I had to take semester C which was a 6 week semester because my financial aid would never process due to personal reasons. It finally went through, but I could only choose between some basic classes. I took Understanding Visual Arts, English 1, Western Civ 1, and Economics. Econ was terrible and I know it would help with my major. So this semester I finally got into an accounting class. I am taking Accounting 1, English 2, Environmental Science, and Religions of the World. I dread my accounting class. The professor is wonderful though, so I know it isn't her. I am 18 right now and have an office job, but I realized it sucks my soul away. I can't do this forever. Let me tell you my original plan.

&amp;nbsp;

I was going to get my Associates degree in Accounting, take a job as a bookkeeper, and then save so I can afford a university and get my Bachelors degree.


Then I would take a job at a firm and make decent money. I don't want to work a desk job forever though because I think I would be a good professor. I came up with the idea of getting my PhD in Accounting. The starting salary is amazing and there is not enough people getting this degree. It is needed. The issue is that I would be in school until I'm nearly 30 if I went this route. I would spend so much money making myself unhappy. I also realized the only reason I chose accounting is because it makes great money. I literally based my major on the pay scale.



I can't make myself unhappy forever doing something I hate. I want to get a degree that lets me get a job where I can contribute. All I want to do is help people, my family, and myself. I don't want to live in a world where I work the corporate 9 to 5 routine. I crave to contribute to a world, planet, and society that is slowly getting worse. I wanted to be a teacher so bad, but not in accounting. I hate math. I love history, reading, writing, helping, traveling, creating, using my imagination, exploring, business, space, the environment, art, and just enjoying the moment. I know I can't get a useless degree. I feel like I might even dislike teaching. I used to want to be a business major because my dream is to own my own business, my creation. I can pick my schedule and work from home sometimes based on what I do. I know there is no easy way out, but I'm at rock bottom. I feel so sad and college is just making things worse.

I'm in my first year at community college majoring in English and I have a 4.0 GPA so far, but I hope that when I transfer I really want to double major in mathematics, and I've tried taking math classes now just to prep. I actually didn't pay attention in math in high school but now that I've been doing it I realize it's something I really love lol. I know it's really early to tell since I plan to transfer as a sophomore but I was wondering if I could have help just ... generally laying out a goal for transfer. I went to a pretty good public high school, but my grades were pretty bad freshman and sophomore year because something bad happened freshman year that sort of wrecked me emotionally; by junior year I had learned to cope and I graduated with 3.9 weighted GPA. I didn't apply to a lot of schools because to be frank, I really didn't know where to start - my parents weren't born in the US and didn't really complete a lot of college, only as much as they could while they were also supporting their families, and so they can't really give me advice. My college counselors would try to help, but they also had to deal with a lot of other kids, so I didn't feel like I got the help I needed, so I just ended up applying to UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, NYU, and Sarah Lawrence. I got into all of them except UCLA, but even with aid I just couldn't afford the tuition, and I ended up going to community college.

I feel really stupid because I really don't know where to start researching colleges to transfer to at all. I can't really ask my family because of what I said already, and besides them, I don't know who else to really turn to. I've been considering applying to privates but I feel sort of hopeless, since everyone says there's no real point if you're coming from community college, and if anyone could offer input on that, it'd be really cool of you. Financial aid-wise, I've been working a bunch and I've saved up enough to at least make a dent in my tuition, but I'd still need financial aid, since I can't really rely on my family too much. I'm a little intimidated by loans but I'm willing to go for them this time. If anyone could offer suggestions on what to do from here too, I'm all ears.

Sorry if this is wordy ... because I'm still a freshman in college, I tried to include background about high school to give more info, but idk if it's even that relevant. Thanks so much!

The FAFSA hasn't given me much because my parents look wealthy on paper. What the FAFSA doesn't know is that my family is so burdened with debt that they can not afford to give me a penny. With that out of the way, I am 21 years old and will be a super senior in college next year. I live in Chicago and pay a modest rent of $470/month. I took a year off school to work and become a resident so I could transfer from Columbia to UIC and get in state tuition.

In order to get my bachelors I have about 2 more years of school because not all my credits from my last school transferred.

I'm a freshman. It's embarrassing to talk about, but I've survived three suicide attempts so far since 7th grade and have a formal diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder as well as PTSD, general anxiety, and borderline. My insurance doesn't cover the medications I would need to be on so I don't take any (family can't/won't pay for it and I certainly can't afford it). 

I hate the school I'm going to, it's small and quiet which is not an environment I do well in (ironically enough), and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. For a long time I was considering pre-med but I don't think there's any chance I'll be able to keep up with the chemistry requirements because while I'm an excellent student chemistry has always been incredibly difficult for me. 

Right now I'm in a psychology program but if I want to be guaranteed a spot in the higher level classes I need to declare my major in about two weeks or they'll fill up, and I'm not sure I'm ready to make that commitment.

My parents don't want me to transfer until after this year but to be honest thinking about spending a whole year here makes me want to pull my hair out roots and all. 

I'm just incredibly depressed right now. I'm not even homesick, though it is hard not having anyone nearby, friends or otherwise, who I can be honest about how I'm feeling with. Every morning I wake up wanting to kill myself and every hour the feeling gets stronger. I've tried giving this whole experience the shiniest, positivest outlook I can muster up, but every single moment I've been here feels worse and worse. How much longer can I, or should I, keep going before I make a decision that involves me leaving this school?  

I want to do great things with my life, I really do. I've got a high IQ, I do well in school, but I'm tired of being miserable and don't think I can be this miserable for this long without something breaking. I can't stop thinking about killing myself. 

My parents don't understand that I can't just ~decide~ to be happy. I don't want to drop out. I don't even want to transfer before this year is over. I'm just so tired of feeling like this, this is not how I wanted my college experience to be. I was hoping to turn over a new leaf but this has been worse than any other time in my life.

46,atraxicorico,1468735870,/r/college/comments/4t8hmf/dealing_with_quarter_to_semester_prerequisites/,"Okay so no matter where I go, i seem to get screwed over by classes from my original university. Also I'm the first person in my family to go to college so its hard for me to get advice about it at home. 

I started college in Fall of 2014 at a University of California as undeclared. I knew I wanted to be an engineering major but because of a lot of overcrowding and other UC system issues, I wasn't able to enroll in pre-req classes (i.e. math, physics, and chem for engineering, pretty standard lower div science major classes). I thought about dropping out after my first year and attending a CC but was strongly advised against and that transferring would not be an issue. I finished my second year with a quarter each of Calc and Gen. Chem. (After spending countless numbers hours and brain power trying to crash classes, email professors, complain to departments etc. I did, however, finish my GEs) 

Now I've finally gotten accepted to the engineering school of my dreams. Problem: I can't afford to spend $50,000 a year in tuition for 4 years as I will basically be starting the program as a ""freshman""(yes I'll get a lot of financial aid, but I'm pretty sure I'd only be able to get 2 more years of government aid/FAFSA and my new university is private/out of state). So I deferred my enrollment (first for a quarter, can extend later) in the hopes of making up some credits at a local CC. The problem I've had with this is that I need 2 semesters or 3 quarters of each class and my 1 quarter will not prepare me for semester 2 of math/chem (found this out last summer when trying to enroll in Calc II). 

Next problem, all of my local community colleges (SF Bay Area) are semester system so I would have to repeat the only useful credits I've earned in math/physics and I *really* do not have the extra time/money to spend on repeating classes that I did well in because I need to keep a part time job on the side to pay for things like health insurance. The only quarter system CC is De Anza College which is 2.5 hours away from my house (San Francisco) by public transit and I don't have a car or a license. However, I could use my savings to get a used car and commute would be 45 mins. It would also only take me 2 quarters at De Anza. My mom, however doesn't want me driving to school every day and doesn't understand that this is the only option I have other than repeating coursework. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I guess my questions are is it worth repeating 2 semesters of coursework when I could be making more progress in 2 more quarters of classes? Is there a workaround with CCs for getting them to accept quarter credits? Are you only eligible for FAFSA aid for 4 years of undergrad?

I graduated in 2015 with a BA in anthropology (focused on biological) with a GPA of 2.4.  I want to continue my education but cannot get anywhere because of my low GPA, reaching out in hope that someone can help guide me to the next step.

Some of you may get a laugh out of this, but my dream/goal is to go to medical school.  I've been told many times to give it up, my degree is useless, and so forth.  And I do admit, an Anthropology degree is pretty difficult to get around.  To make it relevant, I focused more towards the Biological side of the discipline, working with biostatistics and genetics data.  I took courses in public health, medical anthropology, biological physics, things of that nature that are offered at my university.  Academic performance and competitiveness, is where I fail at and absolutely where I should have been more careful about.  I was under a very difficult circumstance, which of course, is what many students with poor academic performance would also say to justify their GPA.  I've reflected about this over and over again and take full blame for everything, I simply want to move on and learn from these mistakes find a way to fix it.  I tell you a little bit about my background and circumstances, not as an exhaustive list of excuses, but as a lesson that hopefully someone can help me out and evaluate the options I now have.

The one positive thing about all of this, I graduated with no debt and didn't take out any loans.  I came from SE Asia and was born in a small village with no running water, no electricity, we lived a very primitive and simple life.  How I get to the U.S is a long story, and I will spare you the details.  I came here when I was relatively young, but took a while to adjust and learn all the new technology, the first time I used a computer was when I started my first day of class in the U.S, it was in 5th grade.  I was the first in my family to attend and graduate High school, and then college.  As you can imagine, everything was a ""learn-on-the-job"" type of situation.   Applying to college was a magical situation for me, everything was online, submit a few essays...and that's it.  Who submitted my documents, test results? How'd they know it's me? Everything was just done automatically, it was a little shocking to me.  But somehow, I managed it, I got in a decent state college (UF).  I was a little behind the curve with technology, but everything else, I managed.  But that's when everything just went sour.

Being away from home was, of course, a little difficult.  But I managed the first two semester fine.  My second year and forth is when everything just went bad.  I started overthinking about what I wanted to do, the end goal, that I over load on volunteering, extracurricular, silly resume booster things that are now meaningless because of my incompetent GPA.  My grade dropped, I became ineligible for the grants and aid I was receiving and ended up having to take a job to cover for these expenses.  I was literally illiterate when it comes to money and financial aid at that point.  My parents advised me against loans (it's a big no-no and highly stigmatized for them), and of course I listened.  I made absolutely no use of the resources available, had no idea where to look for help or even ask questions, I felt like completely lost and ashamed in front of my peers with my situation.  Looking back, I was a fool and hated myself for it.  I worked overnight shifts and weekends at the hospital, scheduled my classes early in the morning so i can go straight to class after work, getting paid 10/hr, you can imagine how it was to pay for 3-4k tuition a semester.  My schedule would often look like this: 10pm-8am (work) 8:30-noon (class).  It was exhausting, I studied on the job, on the bus, between classes, during lunch, on the toilet, literally anywhere, just to get by with a 2.4.  Pretty sad, I know.

I graduated and working now at a dead-end job that pays 9/hr, even worse than when I had no degree.  Doing everything I can, volunteering, researching, everything and anything to hope for a chance that some school would look pass my horrid GPA and a somewhat irrelevant degree.  My GPA is too low to even apply to any postbacc, masters, certificates.  Some have suggested that I do some DIY classes at a nearby school to raise my GPA, but that would require me to be a non-degree seeking student, which would rule out financial aid, I can't afford tuition with my job and even if i could, that would be making the same mistake all over again.

What should I do reddit?  I've consider cutting my losses, apply for a second degree and get a STEM major? I'm really at a dead-end this time around and it's becoming quite a burden/depressing thing to handle.  Reaching out for some words of wisdom and advice.  Thank you, reddit.

I've been wasting my life away up until recently and decided that I want to get my life back on track.

I've enrolled to a local community college about 8 or so miles away, and my parents would have to drive there to drop me off and drive back to pick me back up. So that's 32 miles every day I have class. I live in a very rural area (&lt;2,100 population) so it's not like there's a college I could walk to, this is the closest one and it doesn't have boarding.

I've applied to almost every place I can in my area but since it's so rural there are rarely any openings. Since I haven't been to college or ever had a job, whenever there actually are job openings better qualified people are the ones getting them.

My friends tell me financial aid doesn't give me spending money until about a month after I've been in the college. If there was some way I could get it earlier then there would be no problem.

Should I take a break from college?  I am a sophomore.

**Money**

Here's the big one.  I'm a little worked up right now, so if something doesn't make sense, just ask.  My parents are in a bad financial situation and can't afford to help me at all with college.  So far, I have payed for 2 full semesters out of pocket, and my grandparents have paid for 1.  The amount of money that I have in my savings right now, is about the exact amount that I would pay for next semester.  If I stay after this semester, I will have *absolutely*  no money in my bank account.  I've tried lowering my work load over the summer, where I had a job, and it was terrible.  I ended up withdrawing from the class because my job was way too much.  But I NEEDED a job in order to go to school this semester.  

**Family**

I have a feeling some of you will tell me not to worry about my Family, but I can't help it.  Over the past two years, my parents have been in a crazy financial situation.  My mom is a stay at home mom who takes care of my baby brother with his condition, and my dad works 3 jobs to get food on the table.  About a month ago my parents have filed for bankruptcy, and as far as I know it is becoming a little bit better.  But nothing worries me more than seeing my mom upset all the time, and never seeing my dad because he's working all the time. 
This, and a couple family deaths that happened right at the beginning of the semester has seriously thrown me off track.

**Grades/Social Life** 

Last year, freshman year, was the best time I had in my entire life.  My grades weren't good, usually just barely passing a class with a C, but I had met a lot of amazing people.  This year is different though.  Ever since the first day of school I have been stressed over money problems, family, and my classes are getting tougher.  I never see any of my friends from last year.  I feel depressed so I just stay in my room most of the time.  When I force myself to go out and be social, I just get overly self conscious and feel like a buzzkill to everyone around me.  At the beginning of the year, I was worried because the professors that I was stuck with had *horrible* reviews.  And boy were they right.  I'm not learning anything with so much on my mind, and I am really rethinking my major (Mech E).  


I'm sorry if a lot of this sounds scattered, there's just a lot on my mind.  I could write so much more but I really need to stop where i'm at.  I would really appreciate another opinion.  The counselors/academic advisors at my school are not very good, and make it obvious that they are only helping because it's their job.  I have not told anyone about my possible decision.

52,[deleted],1435250098,/r/college/comments/3b382p/lost_a_financial_grant_by_04_gpa_do_you_think_i/,"Hi all.

So before I begin let me just state that I completely understand this issue is because of my performance academically, and I take full responsibility. I know they're not required to round up and no one owes me anything.

So I am going into my senior year at school and last year (junior) was my toughest ever in my engineering major. I am in ROTC, and my school offers a ""supplemental"" ROTC room grant if you can keep your cumulative GPA above a 3.00. This is checked annually, not by semester. The amount changes from year to year, but it's generally for around $9,000 for the year (the price of housing).

So my fall semester last year was honestly terrible. I just had never taken any classes that hard, and it seemed like I took all the hardest classes at the same time. Overall my semester GPA was a 2.1 (yikes!).

This past spring semester, I had similarly challenging courses, and actually 2 more credit hours than the fall, and I managed to earn a 3.5 GPA, quite the turnaround. Unfortunately this only put me at a 2.96 cumulative, and I see today that they are not extending the room grant to me (understandably).

I have also checked to make sure the document for the grant says ""3.00"" instead of ""3.0"" which I could technically claim 2.96 meets.

Anyway, it may not seem like much, but I really have no other source of funding. My parents can't pay for it (and that is completely ok with me), and I can't, even with the paid internship I have this summer. In all honesty, without this I might not be able to fully afford to attend. I also understand loans are an option, but I already have quite a bit out in loans and would prefer to stay away from more if possible.

Do you think I have a chance of getting it reinstated? I'm not sure how I could put my request into words to the school. I wasn't sick, no one in my family died, it was just really hard and even after catching up, I was a hair off.

Thanks!

EDIT: I should also mention that due to ROTC and engineering requirements, I have been over the ""full course load"" number of credits (16)  every semester since my freshman year. This year was especially bad with 21 credits in the fall and 23 this spring.

I went to a small liberal arts school, (ranked ~85th in USNW), for two years and left last year. I am currently living with my parents and working to pay off my loans, but I really want to go back to school in the fall of 2016. However, my options seem a bit limited. I live in California, so trying to go to a UC means I would have to spend 2 years at a local CC, thus wasting my two years of college credits. I am considering applying to CSUs, however both my parents went to CSUs as undergraduates and both were very unimpressed with the education they received. They are actively discouraging me from going to a CSU. So at this point I am hoping to transfer to a private school. My college GPA is about 3.5 and I have good extracurriculars, however my family income is about $65,000, meaning I do need financial aid. Does anyone have any advice regarding where I should apply? I would be majoring in political science/history, and I am open to any suggestions y'all may have.",college,Where should I apply as a transfer?,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/31hu98/where_should_i_apply_as_a_transfer/,1428229616.0

The basic foundation courses (i.e. Drawing, painting, color theory) are ok, but beyond those, I feel that the majority of college is fairly meaningless. 

But why do I go in the first place?

I'm a dirt poor college student, so the money greatly helps me out a lot. It's also hard to find work without a car, and I can't afford one. I don't live in a major city, so public transportation is a joke. I'm also in college to buy time as well, and at least gain skills and pay for things (i.e. art instruction books, because they don't teach *everything* an artist needs to know at school, especially at a public university). I do receive enough grants to cover my entire education, which is how I can even afford college, but also take out loans for family expenses.

I spent 3 years at a community college (amassed 30 credits total) amd a few years in the Air Force and figured college would be a cake walk this time around. I. Was. Wrong. 

This is my first semester in college in almost 4 years and I did not take my school work seriously. I can use all the excuses I've had this semester between family issues, unemployment jerking me around and other menial things, but it all comes down to pure laziness. I'm currently using the Post 9/11 GI Bill and I'm now scared shitless because I'm not confident that I'm going to pass at least one of my classes. I'll have to pay out of pocket for any classes I fail and I can't even afford that right now.

This isn't cry for support, nor am I looking for kind words. What I am looking to do is ask that all of you, whether you are 18 and fresh out of high school or older and in the same boat as I am take a moment to evaluate your performance.

56,[deleted],1400272506,/r/college/comments/25qopj/feeling_a_little_burnt_out_advice/,"A short background story: Right now I should be just finishing my junior year and heading into senior year, but my timing is all messed up. My family only offered to pay if I went to BYU, so I went and they put me on a track where I can only attend in the Winter (Jan- April) and then the Spring (April - July), so I started late. I ended up coming home for the Spring because my family lost their home in a fire so I took the semester off. So my first year, I was already behind 2 semesters. Now, I've been going to school part-time at a local community college (2-3 classes per semester) and working part-time because I can't afford to take any more classes than 2 or 3. I never went back to BYU because I am not Mormon (my family is) and I couldn't handle being at a religious school where I couldn't be myself.

Throughout high school, I wanted to be an English major. I took AP English Language and AP English Literature. When I started college, it flip flopped many times, and now I've been taking core classes to enter into a Nursing major. I know I would be happy in that field because I love helping and caring for others and I would make good money, but I would much rather study English. Though, I know how tough it is for English majors to find work after college. I just am not as interested in the biology and math classes I'm required to take for Nursing. They feel like a burden more than something I really want to study. I know if I'm already feeling this way now, Nursing school will be a million times worse. I can barely bring myself to study because the classes don't interest me. I also wish I could put my full focus on school rather than work, but that isn't an option. I also think living at home with my parents and going to a not-so-great community college is bumming me out, too. :/

What can I do to help pull myself out of this rut? I already took 2 semesters off and don't want to fall behind. I apologize if this question gets asked a ton, I don't usually frequent this sub.

It's ridiculous! I've exhausted all the possibilities the school offers me, and now I have to move on to private loans. Those require a cosigner. I don't have any possible cosigners, because everyone in my family has poor credit. I'm not exaggerating, either. I truly wish I was, because then I could afford college. This semester, I still owe the school 1,500 dollars. I'm trying to get into a program that pays half my tuition and room and board, but that's not a guarantee, and I'm still looking for a job to help pay for everything, but it's not going so well.

58,sazzyoranger,1341691762,/r/college/comments/w6vhj/xpost_maybe_college_isnt_for_meconsidering/,"To start of, mine isn't the usual story where I'm either suffering from an illness or just fudged up by not showing up to class and failing (no disrespect to anyone who is going through it in that particular matter though).

I am in ways glad that I have an opportunity to attend college and took full advantage of it, but going through it was not an easy task. After graduating from high school at 16 years old, I decided that I wanted to just move out and live my own life, one that didn't involve my parents. The reason was that, growing up, I was neglected verbally and physically by all my family members. This created a mind-set that I just needed to get the hell out. So initially right out of high school, I guess college wasn't in my sights. This also affected my performance academic-wise from elementary through high school since I didn't tell anyone about the issues I faced at home. With that in mind, this effected my GPA in high school and ruined any possibilities of going to a good school.

It wasn't until I finally told certain people about my issues and what I intended to do. These people (who I consider and wish were my true family) got on me to go to college, some even threatened me haha.

So with their persuasion and advice, I moved out and started college at 17. It in no ways was easy though. Having to deal with a sociopathic roommate, financial issues, injuries, and illnesses, I pushed though 3 years of community college.

Recently, I got into a nasty car wreck that really set me back. I mean financially, physically, and mentally. It ruined a lot of things in my life the last 6 months. Even with that, I still managed to pass all my classes and get credit. I mean not having a car or to be able to work with my injuries for about 4-5+ months really hurt me.

So I guess to get to the point, after 3 years of community college I decide it's time to make the dive to a college or university. At community college, the costs were low...so my parents income didn't become an issue for me to go (fafsa related). I got accepted to couple of schools and I guess the situation now is that in each school I got accepted to, I still have out of pocket costs that I can't pay for. The reason being is that, I myself can't get approved for loans (I have good credit) and need a co-signer. I've tried to apply for loans with my parents as co-signers (well my dad since he handles the finances) and couldn't get approved since he has bad credit (gambling issues).

After so many years grinding away through college..trying to make the leap to finish at another school just doesn't seem like an option for me. Even after the scholarships and grants I've received... I'm just tired of it. Trying to push through knowing I have a huge road block to hold me back. I want to finish what I started but trying to do so isn't really in my future for the time being.

I'm considering take time off until I'm financially able to afford college on my own...or possibly wait till I'm 24 when I myself can personally take out loans (without a co-signer).

At this point I'm considering taking some time off until I can handle the financial part on my own. Opinions? ",college,(X-Post) Maybe college isn't for me...considering dropping out. 20/M,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w6vhj/xpost_maybe_college_isnt_for_meconsidering/,1341709762.0
