Congrats! but this is also a critical student status bc many can lack the financial or emotional support to succeed in college to reverse their socio economic status. 

Me: 33F Put myself through college w/o any financial, emotional, or mental support from *family.* My father was absent and my mother and I have no relationship-neither went to college. Honestly, I only went to college bc I have 2 cousins my age and we were in school together K-12. Their father &amp; mother were very supportive so going to college was expected of them. So naturally, I decided to still try and keep up with them so I decided I'd go too bc I was just as good as them academically, but their greatest advantage was having a support system. 

They finished on time but it took me over 9 yrs of stopping and starting over, changing majors, relocating, balancing rent, bills and tuition, a full time job and going full time when I was able to. I graduated with a degree in the arts and can't get a job in any art field although I've applied to many different art related jobs I'm qualified for over the last 4 yrs since graduating. 

Now I'm thinking about going back for another degree that's actually in demand like IT or healthcare. The art world doesn't seem penetrable and my curriculum didn't match employer requirements or expectations. But not all art programs are like this I'm sure.

At my age, I wonder if I should have become a business owner instead of being a student all of those yrs. I say this bc the wealthiest people I know don't have degrees-but own businesses instead. If I could do it over again as a first generation student, I would've went into the service first and traveled b4 deciding on a career or major. Or I would've traveled first while researching the economy to find out what majors are good ROIs. If I could do it again, I likely would have majored in becoming an art teacher or marketing and fine arts would have been my minor or even a post bac. My degree feels like a certificate for a hobby but I still hope one day I can use it. 

I followed my passion but it has not been rewarding... at least not yet. It actually caused me more debt trying to escape poverty. I feel as though I let myself and my younger family members down bc yes, I went to college but have nothing to say for myself so if you're first generation or grew up in poverty, choose how you spend your time in college wisely and find something to study that will pay off.",college,Cautionary tale to my fellow first generation college students...,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/surva3/cautionary_tale_to_my_fellow_first_generation/,1645130855.0
1,charmperik,1607202468,/r/college/comments/k7fs9a/to_quit_college/," I’m in a precarious situation; I’m an European (no student debt) liberal  arts student (24 M) who has prolonged his studies by two semesters last  year, only for my thesis to be rejected. While I’ve finished all  courses and got accepted into the Master’s program, I find myself unable  to write the thesis itself - I spent the whole summer and autumn  writing the thesis from zero (as my supervisor requested) and I don’t  have yet even the minimum required words.  
This means I already spent  four years studying a field in which my knowledge is insufficient, not  to mention I realized I lack the capability to work in, plus, I’m faced  with an onset onset of complete lack of interest in it. My parents  refuse to support me for further study - they’re already retired, but  still working on a small family business, which they promised to hold  until I’ll be able to make a decision on what to do with it.  
I’m  currently jobless with no income, stuck at home with my parents and  spend my days either helping around the business or lying in bed  procrastinating on the thesis. Instinctively, I know since summer that I  will never finish the degree now - even if I finished the thesis (the  only way I see myself passing it would be paying someone else to do it,  which I considered in summer, but rejected out of a misguided sense of  conscientiousness and the fact it would be around 920 USD), my lack of  interest and focus means I will not be able to pass the state exams.  
I’m  facing a financial penalty of 920 USD for the next semester - the  earliest term for my final exams is in the summer. Given that I find  myself unable to write the thesis, this would be 1840 USD including the  payment for the thesis - while I understand this is nothing in  comparison to US student debt, I don’t see how such an investment would  benefit me.  
At this point, I’m tired and don’t see any sense in  pursuing the Bachelor’s degree at such a high price - especially given  that by itself, the degree is useless and would require a Master’s, and  even with it, there’s no job guarantee and the pay in the field would be  low. My friends support me and continue claiming I should try to finish  the thesis in order to better my future chances, something I don’t see  happening.  
From an emotional standpoint, I curse myself every day for  my wrong choices in education and the time and effort put in. From my  perspective, I don’t think I’ll be able to justify to myself in 10 years  that I wasted this much money on a degree that is worthless to me; I  understand there are other qualities to education than market value, but  no amount of personal growth will be able to make up for the fact that  I’m not and will be not able to put food on the table.  
For the past  two years, I’ve continually been suffering from the feeling that I’m  wasting my time with the degree - I feel like I’ve stagnated with no  progress.  
Currently, I’m considering quitting my studies moving to  Germany (I’m an EU citizen and fluent in German) and finding a job (most  likely a manual one, since there’s little left for me to do) there in  order to escape the bad circumstances I find myself in, just to see if  anything will change / if I’ll be able to find a better livelihood  there. Is this a good idea? Do you have any other  recommendations/opinions on the course of action I should take?",college,To quit college?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/k7fs9a/to_quit_college/,1607220468.0
2,rosa1200,1491169880,/r/college/comments/632ihk/need_advice_on_whether_to_drop_out_of_college/,"I study psychology at a relatively well-known university in central London. All throughout high school, I dreamt of getting a place there and being able to study there. My mother was very supportive, but my father had always wanted me to study medicine (and perhaps go into psychiatry as opposed to psychology). I felt as though I wasn't passionate enough for going through with medicine (or maybe even smart enough?), and so I chose psychology. According to my father, this was to be a sort of 'trial-year' for me; if I liked it, I would continue, but if I didn't, I would perhaps stop and change to medicine. When I finally got the offer and the conditional score, I was overjoyed.
However, my first year at university isn't exactly going as well as I had hoped. I struggled a LOT with myself in general, my low mood, my uni work etc etc. I started seeing a university therapist in November, and this past winter was incredibly tough. Some weeks I couldn't get out of bed, I would sometimes go for days without seeing my friends and just isolating myself, and I lost quite a lot of weight because of it. I would cry frequently, and even though my friends were incredibly supportive, I wasn't as happy as I knew I could be, and that was frustrating. I loved the friends I made, but I knew I could make better ones, I was always jealous of seeing other people bond together so well and I kept telling myself perhaps in 2nd year, I'll join more societies and get to know more people and find a group of friends I 100% 'click' with.

When I went home over the winter break, my father would continuously ask me what my plans were after I graduate etc etc. Thinking about my future always makes me feel incredibly anxious, so that conversation would always end in a fight or in tears (on my side).

It's not that I didn't have fun. Weekends I would drink with my friends and go out, I've met countless people at my halls - perhaps more of the sort of friends you drink and party with, but I loved them nonetheless. Living in central London was the most amazing opportunity ever, and there always something to do.
However, even as months went by I couldn't motivate myself to do study or do well academically. I would always half-ass my assignments and turn them in last minute, and my mood wasn't getting much better, either. Maybe I wasn't as motivated because I wasn't sure if it was 100% the path for my future, maybe it was the lack of complete support from my father...I don't know, but things just felt off .

And then something awful happened. I won't get too much into it, but in February I was sexually assaulted by a friend. When something like that happens, it takes a bit of time for your mind &amp; body to process what had happened. I spent the next few weeks afterwards just getting drunk constantly. I wasn't aware of it, but I was in a state of emotional shock for a few weeks before all my feelings hit me like a fucking train. I suddenly couldn't stop crying, I was in a constant state of distress, I felt worthless and violated etc etc. I just felt like a glass of water that was a tiny bit overfilled, like my tears would creep up on me in public when I'm ordering coffee or sitting in the library. I felt like a mess, and even walking through the street, I felt like people would look at me, I felt like my sadness and distress was leaking. The only person I've talked about this to is my therapist (can't really tell my friends as they are also friends with him and all), but he (the therapist) is being extremely sensitive about the whole thing so we've never really talked about my feelings about it thoroughly. My academic work got even worse, I had to get extensions for everything, and I even stopped eating completely for a few weeks just to regain a sense of control. A couple friends knew something traumatic had happened (not what though), and they would come check up on me etc, but I can tell they're not really sure how to deal with it all either.

It's spring break, and I decided to fly home to spend a couple weeks here. It's been a couple months since it happened, and I'm doing relatively better. But not completely okay, though. I feel a bit out of control, like my mind is really sluggish and slow. I don't know if it's because of what happened, because I feel fine, really...but then when I think about it too much I start to feel a bit distressed. I just still feel a bit 'off'. Like a bit far removed from myself. Exams are coming up and I don't know if I'm making myself feel all this now to give myself an 'excuse' not to study. I can't motivate myself to study, and it all seems a bit hopeless.

I've been thinking recently that perhaps I should drop out of uni after my first year. All in all, I love my school and my friends and all, but I just feel like I need to figure myself out a bit...I feel a bit lost, I feel very confused about everything, and I feel as though perhaps I'm not mature enough to fully appreciate it all yet (?). I feel as though my first year was a bit wasted in a sense, and I see all my high school friends having so much fun and I had to deal with shit and it just makes me so...upset &amp; frustrated.

However, as its April, it's too late to apply to any other university - if I were to decide to do medicine, I would have to reapply next year (for 2018 entry). So I would take a year off and then apply when I'm 21. For medicine, that would still be minimum 6 years of studying on top of that. Plus, I'm not sure what I could do in my year off. On top of that, medicine is a lifelong commitment. Of course, my future would look far more secure and promising than a future with a degree in psychology, but I don't know how to know if its the right thing for me. I feel as though perhaps putting ALL my life energy into medicine would finally give me a sense of purpose, but I'm scared I'll regret it. I'm scared I'll drop out and quit this amazing school and throw away a good opportunity. But I can't ignore this gut feeling, I can't ignore the fact that I just was so genuinely unhappy in my first year. I should also point out that this psychology course wasn't exactly something I had been expecting, perhaps? It's interesting but I can't get myself to care enough. Psychology has ALWAYs interested me, and I know deep down that psychology/psychiatry are written in the stars for my future. I can't imagine doing anything else. But I can't motivate myself for this year. I just don't care. I feel apathetic. I don't know why. I don't know what to do.

I don't know how to tell if I'm completely healed from what's happened (I don't think so..?), I don't know how to tell if I'm okay with anything, it's like I don't know myself anymore. I can't stop crying every time I think of this whole thing about being confused, and I feel so utterly hopeless. I don't know who to talk to. I'm scared of talking to my parents about it, as I know they'll probably support me leaving, and I don't know if I'm ready for that..? I don't know what to do. I feel weirdly numb.
If you read all of this or even ANY of this, just know that I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I'm just an angsty and confused teenager I guess, and I know I need some proper guidance. Any help or words would be really, really appreciated.",college,Need advice on whether to drop out of college (first year) or not... *long*,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/632ihk/need_advice_on_whether_to_drop_out_of_college/,1491187880.0
3,WorshipMyFace,1422503066,/r/college/comments/2u1ldj/any_tips_for_my_letter_for_appeal/," I would like to be readmitted to the award of the 2012-2015 Federal Student Aid for this coming Spring semester. I am currently on academic suspension for failing to meet a GPA cumulative minimum and failing to satisfactorily complete a least 66.7% of cumulative credits attempted.
During my fall semester at Rio Salado I had high hopes and expectations for myself to not only complete my courses but ace them. But things took an unexpected turn as the year went by. Originally I had been working a part time job as a housekeeper and nanny in order to support myself in the means of paying for gas, groceries, and phone bills. But my parents soon expected me to start paying for rent, as my father is unemployed and could not make enough money to cover his share of the monthly bills. Yes this was an obstacle but I had no choice but to get another job to help support my parents. Overloaded with the stress of work I found a very small block of time I had to finish and even work on my school assignments. To add to this mess I have been suffering with depression and an array of other emotional problems which made my days working and studying more challenging than they usually would be.This ultimately led to my failure to complete my coursework and receive a failing grade for my classes. 
  However with the start of the new year brings new beginnings and plan to move out of my parents house into a house with my sister and start new employment. Without the constant stress of my parents berating me for rent money or money to pay off their debts I will now gain total independence from them that will bring peace to my daily worries of having to pay for a dept that I did not accumulate. Also I will start therapy and medication to cure my mental illness. I have guaranteed employment at work at home job for magazine company as  a telecommuting position. Which in turn will provide me with more downtime and convenience to focus on my schooling and complete my homework assignments. With these changes in place I plan on being a more productive and efficient student whose main goal is to achieve my scholarly goals by putting them first and foremost above anything else.  Without the help of this financial aid I would be unable to attend college due to the lack of sufficient funds so it is imperative that I receive adequate funding from the government in order to continue my education. Though unforeseen circumstances in the past semester lead me to being unable to keep up on my studies and I truly regret how these events played out, but I know with the help of the Financial Aid Award I will be able to rectify my mistakes and continue on in pursuit of my college education.
