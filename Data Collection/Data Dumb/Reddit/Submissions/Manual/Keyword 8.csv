I absolutely adore learning about diseases and immunology. I was set on becoming a doctor ever since I was a kid and it was in high school when I decided I wanted to become an immunologist. I was a part of so many medical/healthcare related clubs in high school and was always the top of the class when it came to physiology and bio. I was also the top student in my high school's medical program. I just loved health and medicine.

However, when I entered college, I began attending seminars where people who had worked in the medical field would come and talk to students. I began to realize that I can't afford to do ~10 more years of schooling/ training and I certainly cannot afford to carry on the amount of debt that will accrue while in med school. I'm a first gen student from an immigrant, low-income family. My parents are getting old and I need to take care of them soon. They're expecting me to get a well-paying job straight out of undergrad which is incredibly unrealistic unless I was a CS major, which I am not. I'm pursuing a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology with a concentration in either biochem, genetics, neurobiology, or immunology. I was initially leaning towards immunology, but apparently it's not a very lucrative area? 

I don't even care about what I like anymore because I feel like what I like (immunology, studying infectious diseases, etc.) doesn't appear to pay very well, at least straight out of undergrad. My concern rn is how high my income will be but with a bio degree and the oversaturation of the bio field, my chances of getting a well-paying job seem low. Everyone is telling me to pursue my passion but I'm starting to hate it because my mind is just automatically filled with shame and guilt because my intended field is not lucrative enough.

Idk what I should do now. I'm going to be a junior next semester. I can't realistically switch to compsci or data science because the courses are just notoriously difficult at my university and I'll need to take summer classes if I want to complete a CS or DS degree on time which I cannot afford even with financial aid and most of the courses my university requires do not have a CC equivalent since my university expects a certain level of rigor.

I'm trying to think of a plan now. I'm definitely going to drop premed. I'm thinking of doing a bunch of data science or compsci certification programs and maybe combining those with my bio degree (idk which concentration I should do) will land me a good job in the biotech field or pharmtech field? Should I choose the genetics concentration for my bio major? Or, something that might be slightly better would be to switch my med school goals to PA school instead and become a physician assistant. It's less years but idrk a lot about the process. 

Idk I'm just really stressed out about my future and living up to my parents' expectations. I haven't been able to pull myself out of bed recently and just feel super despondent about everything. I don't wanna talk to any of my friends. I don't want to talk to my partner. I don't want to talk to my parents. I just feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame so I can only turn to an anonymous forum on the internet for some advice. 

Sorry for the long spiel and I would appreciate any life advice. Thank you! üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",college,I've been feeling extremely depressed recently because I'm not sure how my career prospects will pan out if I get a Biology degree and it's a bit too late for me to change majors,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/uapfv6/ive_been_feeling_extremely_depressed_recently/,1650803709.0
1,CarelessObjective308,1648165987,/r/college/comments/tn91ec/i_feel_guilty_that_my_parents_are_paying_the/,"I am an incoming college freshman who will be attending a top-ranked public school (my dream school) in my state but my parents will be paying the entire cost of attendance. I am a first-generation immigrant student but my family is considered upper middle class (my EFC was double the estimated cost of attendance because the income was low, but assets high). I have worked myself into several panic attacks over the cost of my education because I didn't receive any aid. I think I also have feelings of resentment because for a significant portion of my life we were lower-income but are now living comfortably; it feels like such a traumatic portion of my life is being reduced to nothing if that makes sense. My parents have told me that they are happy to pay for my college and don't want me to take out loans because we can afford it. However, I feel this immense sense of guilt and a fear of failure because they have sacrificed so much for me to get this far and to have everything I have today. I just feel so guilty because they will be spending a significant portion of money just for my undergrad as I also want to attend medical school. I also want to do things such as rush a sorority because it's an experience I really want to have but the costs are so off-putting as a first-gen but the college experience has such an appeal to it.

What can I do to help cope with these feelings? I know I am going to try my hardest to show them that their investment was worth it, no matter the cost to myself. I want to make them proud.

2,brell44,1603827810,/r/college/comments/jj8ahr/asian_college_failure/,"Hi, today I'm going to be talking about my terrible academic life.

I'm a first-gen 20-year-old Asian kid in my Sophomore year of Community College. Didn't get into a state Uni for my accounting major because of a poor highschool GPA. Currently in Community College with a 2.9 GPA as a sophomore and just found out I can't transfer to my state uni that requires a 3.5\~ GPA for an accounting major. I didn't realize I need this GPA until a month ago, I've been a terrible student my whole life starting from Junior year of high school. My mom has been working at the uni I wanted to go to for 10 years as a cook, and some of the kids I grew up with are going there as well. I'm full of guilt and shame for not trying harder during these past years and feel like a huge disappointment to myself and to my single mom.  I don't know what I'm going to do since I can't get into the State Uni that is only a 15-minute drive from my house. I keep hating myself for having such bad grades, I feel like I wasn't mature enough coming into college to realize how important grades are and didn't have the self disciplin to do better starting off. My concerns are I'm going to graduate with a 3. something GPA at an average 4-year college and land only a terrible job and be a huge disappointment to my mom and everyone else in my community. What should I do going on from here? I can increase my GPA but only by so much. Is my life over if I didn't get into the college I wanted to get into? Could I find success with an average GPA from an average college? 

TL;DR, bad GPA at community college, life concerns.",college,Asian College failure,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jj8ahr/asian_college_failure/,1603845810.0
3,lacroixalty,1533760002,/r/college/comments/95pppu/the_college_guide_for_poor_kids/,"hi r/college!

After browsing this thread for a while and also just searching online, I realized that while there‚Äôs an abundant amount of information and college survival tips/guides for the average college student, there‚Äôs hardly any for *actual* poor students and students of immigrants/first gen kids. After three frustrating years at Boston University, a seemingly progressive private institution that basically just discriminates against its lower income students, I decided to create my own guide as a lower income student who is a child of a single parent immigrant for anyone who might be facing the same experiences or about to enter college. Feel more than free to enter your own tips and/or experiences! 

1. Work Study: Most lower income students qualify for work study, and while its a good federal aid opportunity, I quickly realized after my freshman year that you don‚Äôt really get paid enough to live because there‚Äôs a cap on the amount of hours you can work, especially if your parents can‚Äôt afford to give you some spending money too. I recommend getting a second job if possible, and either working very little hours through work study, or forfeiting it altogether. 
2. Financial aid: You‚Äôd think schools would be more willing to help lower income students who are already enrolled but that‚Äôs just not the case. If you ever find yourself needing more money from the school, I highly recommend appealing for more (even if its a small amount). If they deny your appeal, keep calling the office. I have a friend who even emailed our financial aid office once and talked about his deteriorating mental health as a way to guilt trip them into giving more aid. 
3. Discrimination: The funny thing about my school (and probably all seemingly ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù institutions) is that they try to hide how discriminatory they are. This year, and every year for the past three years, I was ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù selected for income verification as were many of my other low income friends. Not very random if you‚Äôre only targeting low income students. Little things like this are the just some points of discrimination I and many others face every year at private institutions. 
4. Health Insurance: If like mine, your parents are immigrants and don‚Äôt qualify for health insurance, the odds are that your school will try to force you to pay for their student insurance plan. That would be fine, if said insurance plans didn‚Äôt cost thousands of dollars, which is kind of contradictory if you can‚Äôt afford health insurance, or tuition, to begin with. I didn‚Äôt realize until this year that there‚Äôs an easy loophole around this if you‚Äôre able to find a part or full time job that offers health insurance, which is helpful to begin with if you already plan on getting a job in addition or in lieu of work study. 
5. Housing: I lived in on campus housing for the first two years of college, and then decided to move off campus. Many other low income students I know fear doing the same because of student housing scholarships, which is fair, but what I‚Äôve found is that living off campus is for the most part still cheaper than living on campus with a housing scholarship. If you also get federal aid, that money can also be refunded back to you to pay for the cost of rent. At the end of the day, paying around the same to live off campus and have your own room, kitchen, privacy etc will always be better than living on campus and sharing a room with someone in a dorm that hasn‚Äôt been renovated in 50 years. 
6. Friends/Socializing: This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with, because I‚Äôm constantly surrounded by middle class and to upper class kids who complain about how poor they are and how expensive school is. Yes, school totally is expensive. But I can‚Äôt pity someone who comes from a well off family when mine can barely afford rent let alone put me through school. (Seriously, I once had a girl complain to me about how her family makes 100K so she doesnt get any federal aid and so ‚Äúin a lot of ways college is harder for middle class students than poor ones‚Äù). Its also hard when your friends parents pay for all their ubers and they can afford to go out almost every day and you can‚Äôt. My best advice is to not try to follow that lifestyle if/when you can‚Äôt. It sucks, but unless you want to work like a dog to be able to afford it, it really isn‚Äôt worth it. 
7. Parents: If you‚Äôre a first gen college student, especially if your parents arent from this country, there‚Äôs a weird phenomena that happens in college where you kind of feel caught between worlds. There‚Äôs the world of poverty you feel like you belong to, and then there‚Äôs the world of academia and security that you‚Äôre introduced to. In a way its alienating, because you can‚Äôt really even turn to your parents for guidance since they haven‚Äôt experienced it. You can‚Äôt ask your parents about motifs in *The Great Gatsby* if they‚Äôve never read *The Great Gatsby*. This is actually still something I struggle with, but the longer I‚Äôve been in school, the more I‚Äôve been able to find people in a similar boat. We‚Äôre all sinking together. 
8. Major: This is similar to the above. There‚Äôs a huge pressure, once again especially if you‚Äôre the child of immigrants, to study something lucrative in college so you can make more money and rectify their choices/emigration. That‚Äôs perfect if you naturally excel and want to study engineering, but it can lead to so much anxiety if you want to study something related to the arts or humanities. My best advice is to study what *you* like and what makes you happy even if your parents don‚Äôt approve, because at the end of the day its your life. Additionally, it can still be difficult to pursue the arts in school because, at least in my experience, most kids who do study something in the arts are the ones who can afford to, meaning they have their parents to fall back on and pay their rent even if they dont excel after college. Or, their parents have the ability to help them out after school with industry connections. 
9. Student Organizations: One thing I‚Äôve found after joining a fraternity is that dues are super high and you can‚Äôt always afford them even if you‚Äôre working. This is even harder if you can‚Äôt ask your parents for financial help, so apply for all the inter-organization scholarships you can, or try to talk to the leader of whatever organization you‚Äôre apart of about lowering your dues.
10. Textbooks: Split the cost with a friend! Check the university library because they often have a copy of whatever book you need! Then photocopy the book or ask to borrow a copy from your classmate and then photocopy theirs! Yeah its time consuming, but textbooks are super expensive and this is a virtually free way to get them. I haven‚Äôt had to encounter any online textbooks that *require*  you to buy them, but I would also talk to the professor of whatever course you‚Äôre taking and explain the situation. They‚Äôre a lot more understanding than the university as a whole.
11. Food: Ask your friends who have meal plans to swipe you in! Buy in bulk! Trader Joe‚Äôs is cheap and incredible! I also recommend buying groceries every two or three days instead of weekly to avoid waste of food and money. 
12. Mental Health: Even today its still kinda taboo to discuss mental health, and i felt weird mentioning that i go to therapy until this year when i realized a lot of my other friends do too. don‚Äôt hesitate to go, even though i know how hard it is to take the first step. More often than not, whatever insurance you‚Äôre on covers most or all of your outpatient costs, and if its still too expensive, most universities offer on campus licensed mental health professionals at little to no cost. One of the perks of being in a high stress environment. 

That‚Äôs all for now but I will definitely update if i think of anything else. Apologies if any of this comes off as bitter or spiteful towards anyone who isn‚Äôt from a low income/international fam, I love everyone regardless but it can definitely be isolating to only see middle class and upper class experiences discussed in both this thread and around you at school.
