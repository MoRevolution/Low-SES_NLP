I’ve been extremely excited to travel, and wanted to plan out a trip in advance for this break. I worked countless hours full-time over the summer so that I could afford to travel a little bit here and there. I asked one of my best friends if she would like to go on a possible trip with me to New York City, and she instantly agreed. I asked her back in June, and I understand that might seem kind of early, however I wanted to make sure that everything was finalized by the time we would leave. I checked In on her once or twice a month just to confirm that the trip was happening, and every time she agreed. She told me that she had a family that lives in the Brooklyn area, and we would be able to stay with them and save some money. I asked her if she could ask her family, and she agreed. However, months had gone by and I still had not heard from her to confirm about staying with her family. Every time I checked in, she would tell me oh yes I’m going to ask, however she never would. To help explain the situation, my friend is a very big overachiever in school. She excels very well and gets very good grades, and is really big on getting internships and planning multiple networking events throughout the school. She is a very hard worker and can do anything she puts her mind to. During this time, she was planning multiple networking events within our college. She is also an RA on my floor. As it was inching closer to October, I was starting to panic about flight prices since I am a big planner. She never got back to me and it really upset me, as I would see her planning all these events and putting in so much effort in school and with her relationships with other people. She ended up ghosting me about the situation and never got back. I ended up booking a flight home for the fall break to spend time with my family. I was really upset. Especially after she had confirmed our plans. I later confronted her saying that I was no longer going to be going on the New York trip and I was going to be visiting home instead. She ended up telling me that she was just really busy with RA stuff and that she was going to be working The desk over the break. However, I asked her multiple times just to confirm that she would not be working during this fall break, and every time she would tell me that she had to break off. I understand that things pop up, however it seems like she didn’t care at all about the situation, and I felt like I was doing all the work myself. If she really valued my time, she would’ve at least been honest with me and told me that she would not be able to go on this trip because maybe she wasn’t interested, or she actually had work. I decided to let it go and never told her I was upset.
However, a few days before we left for break, she told me that she would be traveling to Paris for fall break. This instantly got me upset, even though I acted supportive. She was going to fly to Paris to record a video with a company that she had a interned with over the summer. This opportunity seemed very cool, and I was supportive of her, however she had lied to me about being busy During fall break, because she wasn’t actually going to work the desk. Maybe I don’t know enough about the situation, but from how it feels, she does not value my time. 
Would this make you upset, she has had a past of being avoidant towards multiple situations, it even gets really hard when I see her making efforts to connect with other people. I just feel like a good friend wouldn’t do something like this, and would be honest",college,Would this make you upset too?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y4er8t/would_this_make_you_upset_too/,1665827053.0

Breif- I am an introverted guy.. I need to meet a person 2-3 times to get comfortable I have always been like this but I had a good amount of friends in high school and good social circles because my best friends were very extroverted so I made friends through them 

However here I am having difficulty making friends because I really don’t know how to approach people or can’t connect with most 

It’s been 2-3 weeks now and I did find 2-3 friends but not more …. The friends I found mostly like to play games or sit in dorms which I do not want to do in my college life 

Here many people have formed groups and I see people having fun the more and more I am waiting to talk to them the more difficult it is getting for me to approach people here 

The thing I had quit a good amounts of friend in high school and here I just know few people makes me feel miserable …. Also didn’t have much female interaction 


I am a students from different country so I find it hard to connect with people here to because there are less international people in my college 

However I love the studies and activities here but I always want to enjoy my social life college I don’t want to sit in my dorm room when I have nothing to do ….

3,Jiin_AP,1662384865,/r/college/comments/x6gd1r/how_to_tackle_the_upcoming_ap_classes/,"Many students are greatly obsessed with taking as many AP classes as possible. It is, of course, a correct judgment in a sense that colleges look for students who have not only received a good score on the May exam, but also excelled at school by pushing themselves to the limit. The only problem is that it is hard. A fair number of students are juggling between, say, AP Physics C and AP World History. Well, I am no expert in science. I, however, know one or two things about history and economics. Throughout this writing, I will tell you what it takes to be successful in the history, economics, and politics courses.

1. Read Your Textbooks

A great number of students do not care much about their textbooks. I have seen many students who are carefully listening to what their teachers are saying during class and are jotting down the important points of the lecture. I have also had the honor of teaching a considerable number of students who are asking me a lot of serious and productive questions during class. They, however, fail to realize the bigger picture the course provides as they do not connect one concept with another by reading a good textbook. Reading a textbook gives you two advantages. First, you will be able to memorize more of the things out there. Regardless of how brilliant your teacher and tutor are, you need to know some stuff. A careful analysis of what the textbook says will help your brain to organize many different kinds of information in an effective way. Second, you will be able to be better at writing an essay. Everybody (maybe except me) hates writing an essay on any topic. Still, the world forces students to produce some decent essays. The primary reason students do not want to write an essay is because they are bad at it. If, however, you spend some time with your textbook, all you need to do while finishing an essay is to rephrase what you have read from the textbook. I can guarantee that it is a sound deal.

2. Your School Does Not Help You to Get a Five

The next point I want to make is that, well, different schools teach differently. It does not necessarily mean there are a lot of bad teachers out there. Rather, it means that it is you who needs to take care of the upcoming May exam. My considerable experience as an AP instructor tells me that so many schools simply don’t follow the curriculum provided by the College Board. I am not saying they are all wrong; teachers have every right to design their course as they please. They might, for example, want to include a lot of debates in their classes. What’s more, some teachers may make students participate in a gigantic project that takes a lot of time. Therefore, those who are about to enter the dashing world of the APs have to understand that some unforeseen circumstances will definitely happen. I am not necessarily suggesting you will not be able to grasp what’s in the curriculum because of such activities; anything that’s related to the subject will teach you at least something. What I am saying is, however, that you should put some personal effort into getting a five on the May exam. Go to the official College Board website and try solving some practice MCQs and FRQs for each subject. The point is that getting a good GPA and receiving a five on the May exam oftentimes require a different kind of effort.

3. Everything is Cumulative

I understand that studying is never easy. I honestly do not believe that, given the “wuthering” nature of today’s world, only those who graduated from a prestigious college will be successful. But, if you have decided to start your wonderful career with a little bit of professional knowledge, you should not procrastinate. Many students come to me when they have already screwed up the first semester. They have a firm belief that, once they study hard from, say, March, everything is going to be fine. Unfortunately, the world simply disappoints us too many times. First of all, what about your GPA that was already broken? Sadly, even if you try your best during the second semester, it is hard to repair your fallen GPA. Furthermore, it is never easy to catch up with what you have failed to understand throughout the first term. Materials are the first thing. Take AP History as an example; do you honestly think you can understand the twentieth century without grasping what has happened in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries? The second thing is how your teacher leads the course. What is your teacher’s specific rubric for the essay assignments? What kind of MCQs does your teacher generally give students? These are only some of the questions every student must be able to answer during the first few weeks of the academic year.

Please note that these are just the beginning of the story; a close connection with your classmates is, for instance, also crucial in getting useful information (this does not mean you should make friends to use them). However, I can assure you that, if you study hard with a positive attitude, you can get whatever score you want. Good luck with your beginning of the term!",college,How to Tackle the Upcoming AP Classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x6gd1r/how_to_tackle_the_upcoming_ap_classes/,1662402865.0
4,GabbyTheLegend,1661447611,/r/college/comments/wxjsk3/im_having_a_hard_time_making_any_friends/,"I just transferred to college that’s a satellite school for a university in my state. I’ve always lived in small towns my entire life and I thought it would be a good idea as I didn’t want to be swallowed up by a bigger city than I was used to. 

The last college I went to was relativity small so I had a hard time making friends. People usually made friends with their roommates and I usually got the short end it the stick and got paired with foreign exchange students as roommates. No hate to them I just found it difficult to connect with them as they usually spoke pretty broken English. So I usually made friend with people I worked with when I found jobs around town. 

Since this is a satellite school they don’t have any professors right now for my major on campus. They said something about her transferring or quitting, I dont know the exact details. All I know is I dont have any classes on campus this semester except for my yoga class. 

Because if this I’m struggling to make friends. It seems like everyone else has made friends in their classes and my roommate is a sophomore so she already has tons of friends. I hardly even see her.

I just want to make friends so bad. I’m an ambivert so I lover being around people, I just have a hard time being around new people and making friends. I’m just at a loss as I have a hard time going to college events alone because I feel stupid, and like everyone is judging me for going there alone. I just don’t know how to make friends.

5,benje17X,1660686739,/r/college/comments/wq6rqe/tips_for_incoming_freshman_that_would_have_saved/,"Going into junior year, my hardest year would  have still been the spring semester of my freshman year. Both financially and academically, it as a struggle and I know it’s the start of a lot of freshman’s college career. Here are tips none of the freshman orientation people, the internet, and advisors told me that I think you should know. 

If you don’t relate or your college don’t offer these tips, then ignore them or bend them to apply to you . Also when I say “free services” , I know you pay for them with tuition but they are offered to you for free.

I had a shower in my dorm room so I don’t have tips on public bathrooms or anything like that. Also I didn’t want to have tips like “use rate my professor” or “pirate your books” that everyone knows. 

**Establish a sleep schedule**

Nobody warned me that your sleep schedule would be destroyed, especially when nobody is keeping you accountable so establishing a sleep schedule is key. Mine currently is going to bed at 12 and waking up at 8:30. It’s easy as a teenager to sleep until 10 but a lot of factors like parents aren’t there anymore to keep you accountable. Even on weekends just keep a steady schedule, and no party is going to be great past 12. Set an alarm even if you don’t have responsibilities. 

**Ditch the TV**

First of all, those tvs everyone gets for the dorm will be shitty. Instead of buyin a tv, buy a computer monitor , even if you have a laptop. They make tons of adaptors to display on a monitor and connect a keyboard and mouse. You can also buy a firetv to connect to the monitor if you really want a tv. 

**Maintain a clean room**

A shit ton of stress comes from a bad environment, instead of making a weekend a cleaning day, literally just maintain the cleanliness and if you do it everyday it will take 10-15 minutes max. Get your cleaning supplies from dollar tree, you will need fabric spray, glass cleaner, Lysol wipes, paper towels, and a swifter wet mop. 

**Don’t type your notes**

I see everyone with their new MacBook typing notes on docs and word, don’t. You won’t memorize shit most likely, I suggest you do type your notes for quickness, but write them out on paper or an iPad on your own time. Make physical notecards instead of Quizlet. Writing is just a great tool for memorization. 

**Budget**

You’re spending may or may not be monitored by your parents, and it’s the first time you are the only one who can swipe that card. My best advice is to find on campus dining options you like (it can be hard but just find options). I write out in my calendar when I’m going to spend money and where and how much. I try to limit my eating out and buy snacks that are non-perishable. 

**Investigate where you are going to work**

Getting a job is fine if you think you can handle it, just like investigate the places you wanna work, watch the busy times and make sure you can handle it.

**Don’t skip class**

It’s really easy to miss a class or two, and you will eventually, but don’t purposefully skip class. A lot of freshman classes can seem like an easy A and attendance isn’t required can be a real pitfall, but I see a lot of people go from skipping their easy classes to skipping the important ones. 

**Lightning round**

Bring a snack or gum on first day and say “oh I’m not hungry, you want this” and let it fall into forming a study buddy. 

Don’t use the portable speaker in public unless you want to be hated by everyone around you 

Umbrellas will be lost within a month, invest in a rain jacket 

Don’t go home too often, try to establish a solid life, independent of home 

Accept that long distance relationships **probably** won’t work and will add tons of stress often. 

The sweet spot for classes is ideally 9-3 and try to make blocks instead of walking back and forth everyday 

Once you learn where most buildings are, keep it in mind for next semester scheduling 

Do not miss an assignment, they add up quickly. 

Study a minimum of 3 days, even for easy tests, build those study skills for harder classes. 

Wear fresh clean clothes everyday

6,anarchyisimminent,1651219442,/r/college/comments/ueh08t/i_urgently_need_help_deciding_between_two_schools/,"Hello folks, 

My two top choices right now are Santa Clara University and UC Santa Barbara. Both are great schools for me as an Electrical Engineering major, which is why I'm having such a hard time deciding. 

SCU in in Silicon Valley, and although it is lower ranked overall (around 50) and lower ranked in engineering (over 100) the location, alumni, and professors provide opportunities I couldn't find anywhere else in the tech/engineering world. It has a modest student body of 5K, with small class sizes and a well-designed modern campus with really nice dorms. I know people who are going there as well, and it's only 2.5 hours from home instead of 3 hours. Tuition comes out to $5500 per year. The opportunity to potentially found a startup that changes the world is alluring to me, although it is admittedly unrealistic. I dream of designing personal electrical vehicles of some sort, like hoverboards that use sound frequencies to levitate off the ground. 

Santa Barbara, on the other hand, is higher ranked overall and in its engineering department, #28 in both rankings. It is a large research university with an amazing climate, although Santa Clara isn't far behind. There would be more people to connect with (over 20K), and from purely a comfort standpoint, I like the beachy college town feel over the innovative fast-paced environment of Silicon Valley. Due to a high possibility of qualifying for a Native American Tuition discount, my cost of attendance is likely to be $0. This, however, is not guaranteed, because the process of proving Native American heritage is long and arduous. It is 7 hours from home, but since I wouldn't be visiting home frequently either way, this is unimportant. I am also concerned about the party school rep UCSB gets, as I am not really the partying type myself. I think this could lead to a disconnect from the culture there. Also, dorms are not as nice there, with most being doubles converted into triples. 

So, what's your take? Any advice is appreciated!",college,"I urgently need help deciding between two schools, UCSB and SCU",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ueh08t/i_urgently_need_help_deciding_between_two_schools/,1651237442.0
7,Neopint15,1649320051,/r/college/comments/ty8f72/how_should_i_approach_my_professor_about_this/,"Hello everyone, 

First off, I apologize for the lengthy post. I felt it necessary to give background on this issue. I really really appreciate everyone who reads it and gives me advice on the matter. Please skip to the bottom, if you don’t want to read it all though! 

This semester at my college, I signed up for a experiential learning opportunity, where we are placed in a practicum and then connect that experience back into the class teachings (I learned about this afterwards). Before the semester started, we were sent various options by the coordinator, who was supposed to take a look at our transcripts and interests. I was very clear that mine were still science related, but the coordinator continuously suggested a marketing position. After a while if talking, she sent me a few research opportunities, which I liked. Unfortunately, the interviews available were only during my final exam times… the coordinator said that they were also doing interviews the first week of January. However, in January, she informed me that my research interests were taken and again suggested that I interview for the marketing position at least to see what it is about. Pressed for options and wanting to take part in the experience, I agreed. 

I have a background in science, but for reasons unrelated to this post, I went back to school last year under a business degree (the university would not allow me to take another degree similar to science). My main interests were to get some business related experience, while also learning more about research (so I continued to take science courses in between my business courses). However, I have only ever taken one introductory marketing course as it was not my focus. 

After the interview, I again expressed to the coordinator my concerns about my very limited knowledge in marketing. I was assured that there would be a “ton of support” and that I would have a lot of help along the way. She also said it was very similar to research. Given guidance, I felt I’d be okay; however, I came to find out that the “guidance” was non-existent and the help was on the basis of myself reaching out to various professionals at the university - most who were too busy to meet. I was unable to meet with anyone until the middle of February (1.5/3 months into my project) and they were not a marketing professional but did give me insight on the business. My project mentor also had no clue about marketing and was difficult to meet. Everything was also remote and I was the only one in the class with a business type practicum (everyone else had researcher type positions), so I found it to be a very isolating and stressful experience. 

Due to these limitations, I have found myself aimless about my project objectives and slow to progress. I also found it extremely difficult to draw back to my learnings since I hadn’t much of a background into marketing. I feel I have done very little in my project compared to my peers. We are not marked on our project itself, but we are marked on our reflections about the project. 

As I draft up my final reflection, I am realizing that my project progress did not reflect the course’s materials (based on the concept of “community”) very well. I worry that my professor will think I am incompetent and lazy, despite me having lost a ton of sleep and time over trying to navigate this project with limited resources. I worry this may reflect my mark. 

I have dropped hints about my limited knowledge, in the past. My professor knows that I have only an introductory marketing class, but she doesn’t know the conditions of why I accepted the offer despite it. I feel the fact that I was expecting support and didn’t get it is why I have not been able to thoroughly make connections in the class and have been behind. 

Should I email her and respectfully explain my circumstances more thoroughly? I don’t want to sound like I’m whining, but this course has quite frankly, taken me three times as long as it should have due to all my trouble shooting and I’ll be absolutely hurt if I end up getting a bad mark despite my efforts in an adverse situation. 

I was thinking of sending Something like:

 “I was hesitant to bring this up, but after writing my final reflection, I thought it may be best too… while I learned a lot in this role, I quite honestly do not feel it was the best fit for me due to my limited knowledge in marketing. I was initially hesitant to take the role due to this but was assured there would be lots of support; however, the support took much longer to reach out too and was far more limited than I had expected. I felt I really struggled drawing connections and moving forward in my project because of this, although I really gave it my best efforts. It has been an extremely educational opportunity and I have learned a lot; however, I feel my reflection(s) have not been able to go in depth because I do not have the background knowledge to fully understand my role as a marketing strategist”


In short: was matched in an unsuitable practicum, but I tried really hard and did what I could. Want to send my prof an email to let her know the full circumstances.

I’m almost done with the school year but I’m having a really hard time seeing myself being here for the next three years. I’m not happy where I am. I mostly went to this college because it was the “best” college I got into (the other were lower-tier state schools while my college is a pretty decent private school). I haven’t had that many good moments. I haven’t made any real friends that I consider myself close to. Right before I left for Winter Break, I called the suicide hotline and cried to them that I didn’t connect with anyone at my school despite trying. I also go to therapy regularly at my school and towards the end of the semester, I went a LOT more. I’ve cried more times than I can count within the last year. I also was hospitalized for suicide ideation a week ago and when I saw my academic advisor yesterday, I broke down crying in front of her.

I also had a really terrible roommate that destroyed a lot of my happiness, so that definitely made things worse.

I'm from California but go to college in Georgia. I unestimated how much time, money, and energy it takes to fly and travel across the entire country. If I actually enjoyed my college, I could definitely see how flying across the country is worth it. 

I don’t really enjoy my classes despite taking the classes that I’m the most interested in. In September I thought I wanted to transfer and talked to my counselor about it. I earned a 3.4 GPA (one A-, three B+) which is much better than my 2.9 in high school. However, I'm not sure if I want to transfer anymore, because there's a part of me that thinks college isn't for me. I honestly doubt I'll be any happier at another school. I’m the President of the freshman class and I’m involved in blog writing as well as an acapella group, so I definitely tried to get involved in my school.

9,perpetually_unsynced,1648795807,/r/college/comments/ttkg5b/us_federal_student_aid_tips_sap/,"*…from a random internet invalid that just so happens to do this for a living.*

Preface: I just got done writing this as a comment to someone on r/financialaid, and figured it could potentially be useful to some folks over in these parts, as Federal Student Aid (FSA) logistics can be complex and bothersome. I hope that 1) I’m not breaking any sub rules by posting this and 2) some folks here find this info helpful. **This is a specific topic for students in the U.S.** However, hundreds of thousands lose their eligibility every year due to SAP, and it’s a commonly misunderstood requirement that takes a lot of people by surprise when they lose their money. 

*Source — I’ve been working within an accredited university’s financial aid team for several years, both back-end and front-facing, and have these conversations with students dozens of times daily. I also borrowed dozens of thousands in private loans, and want to prevent as many people as I can from making the same mistake, because f*ck Sallie Mae. P.S. Federal loan interest is historically much lower than private, just so ya know.* 

**What is SAP?**
SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress) is a federal requirement in receiving Federal Student Aid (most commonly including Pell Grant &amp; Federal Direct Loans) as outlined by the U.S. Dept. of Education. Introduced as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 USC 1091(c)], SAP specifically establishes GPA and program completion requirements that need satisfied in U.S. post-secondary institutions to maintain FSA eligibility. These requirements can change based on credits completed, grade level, and diploma type/level. 

**How to Craft a Winning Appeal**
With a SAP appeal, you want to be as specific as is comfortable for you with the information provided. Specifically, the appeal team will typically look for 4 primary things when reviewing your submitted appeal:

**1. Extenuating Circumstances:** This is an intentionally vague phrase, just so you know, as it can obviously vary greatly for every student. Circumstances are generally outlined with a PSS (personal signed statement). I recommend clearly illustrating how the circumstances directly (or even indirectly) impacted your ability to make academic progress during the F/W period (I’ll touch on this more further down). This can include physical/mental illness, a loss of a family member, COVID-19, etc. If not meeting SAP, I wholly recommend completing an appeal **even if you doubt** your circumstances are a good enough reason for a poor GPA or rate of completion. You’ll never know whether or not it will go in your favor until a decision is finalized — guaranteed. I still get surprised all the time. 

**2. Third-Party Supporting Documentation:** This can also vary greatly depending on the scenarios explained in your statement. It can include bills, death/birth certificates, a letter from a doctor, documents related to work (pay-stub, time-card, letter from a boss, etc.), and so on. Generally, you want to provide documentation that includes the following elements:

     - A Non-editable Format: This is one of the biggest reasons I see for a denial of an appeal or a request for additional documents. **An unlocked PDF or Word Doc sent from the student’s email address, for example, is typically seen as an editable document.** It can be easily manipulated through It’s respective software. **An official doctor’s letter with an ink signature and letterhead**, however, would not be editable, nor would any of the above listed supporting documents, generally-speaking, that is. 

     - Hand-signatures &amp; Dates: Self-explanatory. All signatures generally need to be in physical ink. On everything. Forever. BUT, some institutions are temporarily allowing electronic signatures due to the pandemic (***never** typed font signatures though*). Keep in mind that anything except a genuine ink signature could also make for an editable document, depending on the school’s guidelines, which, as a reminder, is a no-no. 

     - Official &amp; Verifiable Third Parties: Keep in my mind also that your institution’s Financial Aid Dept. will very likely attempt to verify third parties, and any counterfeit or forged documents can almost certainly result in expulsion or being kicked out permanently. Third parties could include a health practitioner, a manager/leader of your company, a funeral home, and a shit-ton of others. Any well-respected community professional, perhaps, or pretty much anyone with a pHD that provided you health-related services. A priest or other clergy member is a hard-‘sometimes-but-not-usually.’ A family member and friend would not, in fact, fall within this category. *Unless your friend died. Then, you can use their death certificate. Thanks friend.* If you have any doubts, give your school a call to confirm if a document can be used. 

     - Official Letterhead OR Seal OR Stamp: The appeal team may not always insist on any or all of these, but it certainly wouldn’t hurt your case. It would also almost certainly have your school designate the chosen document as non-editable, which is definitely a win because they can get really nit-picky about editable shit. Get it if you can. 

**3. The F/W Period:** The F/W is going to be a period of time during your attendance, in which you were actively enrolled in and **failed or withdrew from** courses (hence ‘F/W’). Yes, withdrawals can hurt SAP as well, often as much as failed courses. I’d recommend referring closely to your Academic Plan and ensuring all terms/semesters that have failed and withdrawn courses over the last two or so years on your grades list are discussed within your SAP appeal. Ensure you concretely connect the components of your extenuating circumstances in the appeal statement directly to the given periods in question. *This is another very common reason for denial.* It also wouldn’t hurt to call your school’s Financial Aid Team to straight up ask what your F/W periods are. 

**4. Improvement of Circumstances:** This is another one of those primary things students overlook or forget to include within their appeals, thus resulting in unnecessary denials. Essentially, both you and your institution (the responsibility also falls on them, fyi) need to clearly illustrate that the aforementioned circumstances have cleared up or improved enough so that you can now continue making progress with your FSA-eligible program, specifically (say it with me) *satisfactory academic progress* 🌝. This could, for example, be a brief statement included in your doctor’s letter that explains how and why you are able to, now that the dumb, inconvenient stuff regarding your deteriorating health and wellness has since gone away forever and that you’re now medically classified as a superhuman, continue to perform well academically. A doctor’s letter is super useful for these appeals — Depending on the situation, it can often check off all the boxes for the entire appeal in one neat little package. **Secret tip: If your appeal is pertaining to being overworked, you can submit a time-card with manageable work hours, or a letter from your boss saying they have pity-released you from slavery. If the appeal is financial-based, you can show increased wages on a w2 form or pay-stub. If it’s child-related, go ahead and simply mail the child to your institution’s office. Please allow 3-5 business days for review. Results may very.** 

**Finally, what does it mean to not ‘meet SAP?’** 

There are two factors associated with the federal SAP requirement: *Quantitative* and *Qualitative.* I’d recommend giving your Financial Aid Dept a call and requesting clarification on which of these two requirements you are not meeting. **Quantitative SAP** is the number of credit hours you have attempted versus the number you’ve successfully completed, generally indicated on your student account as percentages. **Qualitative SAP** is simply your overall GPA, *always* indicated as a decimal (*duh*). I’d also recommend asking what your specific SAP requirements are in these two categories, as they can change based on grade level, degree type, etc. Generally, I see the typical requirements for the students I’ve encountered in this process to be a 2.0 GPA with a 50-60% completion rate. Undergraduate students with 12 credits or less typically need to have a 50% program completion rate and a 1.5 GPA. Make sure to get this information, so that you can cater the contents of your appeal accordingly, depending on what’s not being met. 

Also, one more big thing — keep a close eye on deadlines. At my university, we have a firm Thursday of start week deadline. It’s likely yours will also have a strict date in place. Just so you know, we can’t deviate from that date. It’s a federal requirement and we’ve already extended it as much as we possibly can without being sub-compliant. If a school loses its FSA privileges (yes, schools have to apply to receive FSA, and many are denied annually) due to a blatant disregard for federal law, so do it’s students. 😌

That about sums it up. Apologies if I was too long-winded here. Tried to be as concise and reader-friendly as possible, but there are a lot of complexities regarding FSA. *A lot.* Let me know if y’all have any questions!",college,[U.S.] Federal Student Aid Tips: SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ttkg5b/us_federal_student_aid_tips_sap/,1648813807.0

11,Important_String_417,1643406858,/r/college/comments/sf1st4/i_really_dislike_the_powerpoint_style_of_teaching/,"The PowerPoint style of teaching has become more and more common as my time in school has gone on. I understand why educators utilize this method so much, as it's convenient for them and it allows students to take notes easily. However, I find this to be one of the most unengaging and unhelpful methods of teaching. 

There truly is nothing more boring than just listening to someone read off a slide. Think about it: when you were learning how to do multiplication by hand, did your teacher show you some Google slides about how it works, or did they walk you through on a whiteboard step by step while having you work alongside them? For me, it was the latter, and I'm very thankful that it was, because people learn so much better by *engagement* rather than simply being talked at.  

For a more age appropriate example: I'm currently taking a Machine Organization class, where we are learning about how computer memory represents numbers in a 32 binary digit format. Converting a decimal number to a 32 bit representation is a logical, step by step process, just like multiplication by hand. However, instead of writing out this conversion process on a white board, my professor simply had the process pre written down on a PowerPoint presentation. When information is presented to you in this way, it is very difficult to see how the process comes together. It is very hard for your brain to visualize each individual step and connect the dots.   

I'm not saying that PowerPoints have no place in education, but they are completely overused and should only complement the conversation, not dominate it. They're soul-less and it honestly makes the professors seem less knowledgeable than they actually are.",college,I really dislike the PowerPoint style of teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sf1st4/i_really_dislike_the_powerpoint_style_of_teaching/,1643424858.0
12,StardustNyako,1641953185,/r/college/comments/s1ucsw/reddit_i_am_burnt_out_and_i_need_help/,"Basically, I am at a place where I'm in my second semester as a ""junior"" and I, just feel like I can't keep doing this. For context, I am 26. When I graduated high school in 2013, that was, a mostly miserable time, except the last year. The ultimate kick in the butt was when my mom lost her job due to layoffs right before I graduated. So even though she got a job before uni started for me again, she insisted I started at community college. 

Shit was hard cause I worked, went to school, only to come home to a dysfunctional family that constantly treated me like lesser. So I went to a trade school to try and speed things up. Graduated, got a contract job for 5 months, but nothing after that. I needed a degree society told me. Fine. I worked, went to school, got into a public ivy. 

That's how hard I worked, because that's how much I just wanted to leave my toxic family. That was my only goal, and I worked my ass off for it. Once I got to my uni, there was still set backs, my major didn't work out so I had to pick another. I still am not passionate about it, but like, it's interesting I guess. 

But, that's my issue. I kept pushing forward to get a job that didn't make me miserable to allow me to live a life I could enjoy (not to get rich, just to be comfortable). And, that I guess, isn't enough anymore. I don't really have an in person support system. I talk to people on the internet for support. I love them, I've tried many times to go places to meet people, virtually and not, but due to likely Autism, I really struggle to naturally and deeply connect, or connect at all with most people.

So I don't have people to talk to, I have some friends in the house I live in to banter with but not talk to per say. Not to discount them, they're usually wholesome people. The problem is, I've been marching forward, for so long without having people, there.  

So, I'm just, tired. I'm tired of the endless school work, tired of telling myself I'm almost there, and then some setback pushes the goal psot farther away. I can only be an endurance longer so long. I guess I just don't feel like this is endurance anymore, but a sick joke.

 I have to deal with a lot of past trauma stored up, because my insurance won't cover a trauma specializing therapist, and because of my internship taking me out of state, I can't justify paying for a year of insurance when I won't get to use it for a third of my year. Applying for insufficient coverage feels like it won't get me any where. I can'ttake time off because I'm living off financial aid. I can pivot careers once I am done school but I can't jump off this ladder after everything. I just need to earn my darn bachelors. I'm debating telling my best friend about this, for some reason just considering that got me fuckin' balling. I think because she's the first person since my elementary school occupational therapist to actually outwardly say and show that she believed in me.  Ah, yeah, I think that's it. I am just at my limit, continuing to work through classes is getting hard.

I have enough friends by proximity - people I hang out with enough that I feel I can call them ""friends"" - but no friends that I feel I've actually connected to. If I left my school today, I feel like I wouldn't talk to any of these people anymore, or make an effort to remain in touch - we're friends more because we run in the same social circles/it's convenient for us, not because we've really connected with one another. It's hard to find new ""circles"" of people to hang out with in hopes that I'll fit in better, too, because the school is so small

Is this normal? Everyone is always telling me that I'll make friends I'll have for life in college, and build these deep connections; I just haven't done that so far. I didn't have this trouble in high school; I remember after my freshman year of high school, I felt very close with the friends I had made the previous year. Here I just...don't. 

How do I find people that I can really connect with/that I feel like I fit in with? I'm already doing extracurriculars; I've met a lot of people I'm friendly with through them, but no one that has become a close friend.

I’m trying so hard to just not be a bother anymore.
 
I'm a junior in college, but I've always had a lot of trouble making friends. I've never felt like I fit in anywhere, or that I really matter to anyone.
I'm trying for what is starting to feel like a last ditch effort to connect with people but I'm exhausted. I try to join conversations, I get talked over. I try to start conversations, they die, or someone (cooler/funnier/prettier) takes over. I ask people to hang out, and they either say no or just ignore that I even ask. I try and engage like everyone else in my campus ministry group chat, but they completely ignore me. I go to sports games with people and that’s really the only time I feel like people want to engage with me - and that’s because everyone is extra social at sports games. 

Feeling this awful about my relationships with people makes me feel emotionally sick. Because no matter how hard I try to be a good friend, no matter how I try to fit in when ""myself"" wasn't good enough, no one wants me around long term. No one needs me around. I'm invisible. I can feel my friendships dying as I sit here.

i really havent had a solid friend group since middle school. i spent high school trying to become fully myself, and consequently ended up never having consistant, satisfying friendships. i spent my time drifting. there were people who liked me, sure--i made it my goal to be kind to everyone and make them feel comfortable around me, because i was so used to being uncomfortable around others-- but, they also forgot about me, or chose not to include me. even the person who told me i was their best friend hardly invited me to spend time with them outside of school. it felt like i was never anyones first pick. 

when i would talk to my mom, sister, therapist, anyone about it, they would all tell me similar things: you live in a small town with a limited number of people, when you go to college, you will find so many people to be great friends with. so i settled for just getting by in hs, even if i was lonely most of the time.

i was pretty excited to move to college, considering this hope that i would finally have good people as friends after 4 years of nothing. 

but when i got here, i was hit pretty quickly with the reality that people arent interested in being friends with random people. no one cares if you are sitting alone in the cafeteria, or walking alone around campus; no one is going to notice that you are lonely and start a friendship out of the blue. i didn't connect with anyone for a full 4 days after i moved in. i forced myself to get someone's contact info once, and they are still the only friend i have. and it isn't as if i hide in my dorm; i go about my life just like everyone else. my friend said they were also very lonely, but they not only have a sibling on campus, but have friends from high school here too. i dont. i know one person from hs and they arent interested in spending time with me. 

when i re-asked my mom, sister, therapist what to do now, they all say that even if it's hard, i need to seek out groups that im interested in and i will meet my people there. so ive tried. and there are so many times when i want to speak but i freeze up, or i blank, or i think about it too long and miss my chance. but once again, no one shows interest in me as a human. and i cant help but feel that if i have to keep initiating a connection, i am just forcing people to talk to me. i can ask for information all i want, but if im the only one reaching out, they really dont want a connection with me, they're just being a nice person. 

my friend has invited me to go along with them and their other friends for eating or going out, but even then, their attention is on the other people, and i am so uncomfortable. any time i speak, i feel so annoying. there are times when i begin to try to act like the other people, instead of being myself, in hopes of getting a little attention from the group, but i become so exhausted and upset that i have to change to feel liked. i have to spend the whole time internally soothing myself and trying to rationalize why im not being talked to, or looked at, or heard, or walked next to, or whatever. i have to constantly convince myself that what i said wasnt annoying, or convince myself not to say something i would normally say because i know this group of people wont be interested. i think some people might say that if i am so lonely i should take any connection i can get, but dont i deserve a meaningful friend? dont i deserve to have a person just like everyone else? 

i really dont know what to do anymore. i feel like im incapable of talking to anyone. i feel like there must be something off-putting about me that people avoid connecting with me. am i just never going to have real friends? my mom doesnt have any friends, am i going to be like her? am i going to constantly be a second pick, someone forgotten and left out for the rest of my life? it hurts and i dont know how much longer i can keep struggling with this. 

does anyone understand what im going through? does anyone have any advice that might actually work, especially for someone rapidly losing hope like me?

Hi everyone! 23 year old, female, 2020 grad in the US and current math/english/computer science tutor here. Been a TA in 3 different disciplines, convinced professors to restructure classes, gotten WIFI upgrades for a whole dorm building, and so on. I want to share that knowledge with people that can use it, since it made my life so much easier in school. After hearing from so many of my students, and seeing so many ""advice for new college student"" posts all over reddit, I wanted to post here with a list of some of the best tricks I accumulated in my time at school. Some may apply more than others, since my school was on the smaller side. However, many center around one thing - get to know the people who work at the school. And not just your professors. They know things and can help in ways you don't even know about.

Much of this is from personal experience, or from stuff I've heard from friends or tutoring students. Don't take it all as gospel, since some of it may not apply to the college you're at but try to read it for some of the general concepts if nothing else. Also I am sorry it's so long, I really want to give y'all as many tools as possible though. 

# The FIRST and most important thing is names.

Names are one of your greatest weapons. People like to be remembered. And you can get a lot more help if you can ask for a senior person by name. Not in a demand-y way, of course, but being able to say ""Oh, is there any chance that Bob is in today? He was great when I needed help with X, Y, Z last time!"" doubles as a compliment and a means of getting speedier/better help! **Keep a running notes list of people and interactions with them.** I recommend in your phone, either as an actual list, or a series of contacts with their company field set to their job, a phone number for them/their department, and whatever other info you find helpful in the actual notes part. Seems like a bunch of clerical work but it is OH SO HELPFUL when you need a new bed frame and can just open contacts, type in ""SCHOOLNAME maintenance"" and see that you had Steve fix your door when the lock broke and Glenda was the nice desk woman who sent him.

Given the above example, here is a good starter list of people to know/get help from

* **Janitors or maintenance people** \- they like you? You've been nice to them? They'll be more helpful than they probably would. Most people think of them as background, but they're the reason the showers work, the heaters don't spew dust and can fix your door when the lock gets jammed. By senior year I had enough cred with these guys that I got a full new set of furniture and mattresses for my room. Totally worth it.
* **The person that answers the phone in the maintenance office**. They just know most, if not all, of the maintenance guys, and probably a lot of coordination and behind the scenes people at the school. Call with a simple question, and REMEMBER (or write down) their name.
* **Security guards -**  most schools will have a main security number that you can call for a bunch of stuff they may not actually mention. I had some joint issues that screwed up my ankle for a few years. Sometimes walking across campus between classes wasn't possible. I could call them up and they'd come pick me up and make sure I got to class okay. This was not an accommodation thing either, they did it for anyone that asked. It also applied to feeling unsafe walking around at night, etc. It can really help. Keep the security number in your phone as a contact all its own.
* **Teachers assistants / free tutors etc -** I'm talking about the writing center, the math tutoring that many schools have, TA's that have office hours, lab TA's and on and on. If they're still a student and working in some teaching capacity its VERY likely that they WANT to help and really enjoy it. I loved hanging out in the ceramics lab when I was a TA and was always THRILLED to be asked for help. We do it to help, and if you're nice to us we'll often go above and beyond. There is another side to this, if you go to tutoring/office hours of those student teachers and TA's - you'll meet other people (probably from your class) that are trying to study. Possible new friends or at least fellow commiserators are always a plus! And you'll have more people to panic text if you're not sure when an assignment is due.
* **The IT desk people -** They keep the wifi up. And the wifi is usually very important for studying, etc. Make sure you know the name of at least one actual university staff member that works there. They often hire students, and the students can help but are usually rather limited. Also, if you ever need to get them to fix something, especially in a dorm, get at least one or two other people to agree its happened to them and then call it an outage. The word ""outage"" indicates a special kind of *get on this right now* in IT. I got the Wifi in my dorm upgraded cause I went to them with a petition from like 30 people about how bad the wifi had gotten in my dorm :)

# On to academics:

I took a lot of classes across a lot of disciplines, so each trick's usefulness may vary school to school, though many of them are pretty all encompassing.

* READ the syllabus. It will tell you many things that are not explicitly written.
   * For example: Is there a schedule? Yes? Good! You should write all those dates in your planner/calendar. No? Pay closer attention to what the professor says is upcoming during lectures. Profs will often tell you if they will move exams slightly during syllabus day. Remember which ones they are, cause they're more likely to reschedule a test if another couple major courses have an exam the same day. 
* Many people talk about picking the class for the professor. ALSO PICK IT FOR THE TA/GRADER, WHEN APPLICABLE.
   * Find out if the class is graded by the actual professor, a grader or a TA. Many classes, especially smaller schools will have things like math homework graded by TA's/graders and exams etc graded by professors. This saved me because physics lab was TA-graded and I managed to pick the section of the most experienced and lenient grading TA. Made a hard class WAYYYYY more manageable.
* IF you are unsure which of a few general requirements to take, sign up for one (or even two) extra, go to each of them and drop the ones that seem the least appealing. Base this at least partially on the professor.
   * You may get there, see the syllabus and go ""SIX ESSAYS at least TEN pages EACH?!"" and be able to have a fall back class that still fills a requirement. This way you're not scrambling to find a replacement when the good courses are full.
* WHENEVER you have an essay due, make an outline that's fleshed out enough to give an idea of your thoughts and arguments, at least a week before the due date. Then schedule a meeting with the professor to go over it.
   * The feedback they give is always helpful, follow it. People like their ideas acknowledged. The most important thing (at least that I found) was how they reacted to it. Did they like it? Keep it. Didn't like it? Tell them next class that you reworked the topic cause you thought of something else. They have to read tons of papers, and interesting papers or ones that aren't about the Same Thing tend to not be compared to as many. The smaller the sample size of papers for that topic, the more likely you are to not be graded as harshly. 
* If you dislike a professor, offer to help them. Show up to their office hours, even just to chat. Chances are that a lot of students dislike them, and a little kindness goes a long way.
   * Even the profs I disliked for their teaching style were cool human beings. Professors that are actually BAD on all fronts are rather rare. See the good side and play into interacting with them that way. In doing this, I convinced the worst (terrible teacher, questionable human sometimes, but very intelligent) professor that the computer science department ever had that I was fond of him. Talked him out of some bad pop quizzes, and managed to make him filibuster his way through several whole 2 hr class periods just telling me about his life. Honey over vinegar, always.
* If a class isn't limited by some resource that determines the number of spots (i.e. pottery wheels, computer desks, physical seats in the classroom etc) and you want into it, get on the waiting list and then just SHOW up to it.
   * On the first day of classes, show up to that course with a printed add/drop form and say you're on the waiting list (if you're first on it, mention that too, otherwise just say you're on it). Then ask if they would be able to add you. That max number of seats (unless determined by materials) is often set by the professor, and can be overridden by the professor. Trust me it feels weird, but the worst they can do is say, sorry no I can't let more students in. This shows the prof that you will actively participate, you're on top of things etc. Have the prof sign the add/drop and then immediately go get it put into your schedule at the registrar's office. In person. This never failed to get me into a course.
* Some professors, despite being professors, are noticeably better at teaching one-on-one than lecturing to a larger class. If possible, go to their office hours, or schedule a meeting with them to get help.
   * Usually you won't know until you try, so I highly advise trying. They have office hours for a reason. Bring a study guide, your notes, some part of the slides/book that didn't make sense. Being able to show them material helps a lot in getting a good explanation too. 
* If your professor is unavailable, or you don't gel with their teaching style but can't switch sections of the class to get a different prof, go to ANOTHER PROF'S office hours. Even if you like your prof, but they're busy or something doesn't make sense, try another person's explanations :)
   * Feels weird right? Surprisingly, most profs don't mind this. Don't tell other prof that your prof is bad, just say they're super busy today and I was wondering if you're able to help with X. Sometimes even if they don't teach the class they have in the past or they know the material. This saved me in O-Chem, on many many occasions. If you go back to them again, just say ""The way you explained.... really helped me understand the material better! So I wanted to ask about this....."". Those compliment questions will get you far.
* Befriend as many upperclassmen as possible, both in your major and out.
   * The ones that have been TA's often know how stuff is graded (we see A LOT of the rubrics) and the rest can point you in the direction of the good professors at the very least. The real heroes will sometimes even give you old notes. 
   * Especially in computer science this SAVED me more times than I can count. Newer students would ask the upperclassmen for help in the computer labs ALL THE TIME. And that student solidarity kicks in and all of the sudden the freshman that couldn't make their game render properly has a few of the best students in the major debating what could be causing it, and 10 min later - it's fixed. It really does take a village to survive college, so make sure you know the more experienced villagers.
* Stay ON TOP OF your homework. Especially in smaller schools where the prof might notice  if you don't. 
   * When life does happen and you need an extension, being able to say (with the gradebook to back you up) that you've worked really hard to stay on top of assignments and this is the first (or one of the few times) that you've been late on something makes a HUGE difference. I know homework sucks, but if its assigned there's a purpose. Even if its busywork, it's points you don't have to get later.
* Asking IN ADVANCE for an extension. Even if it's just the day before. 
   * Email your professor something along the lines of ""Hi Professor X, &lt;newline&gt; I had thought I could finish assignment Y for class Z by the due date tomorrow, but now that I'm partway through it I don't think I will be able to finish it in time and do a good job on it. Could I have a 24hr extension? &lt;newline&gt; Thank you, Cat"" or some similar variation if a health emergency or other impeding thing comes up. 
   * Always, ALWAYS mention being partway done since that is often the case and makes it about circumstances or not having enough time to finish (rather than a case of i-didnt-start-yet-oh-no).
* Have MULTIPLE advisors - at least one in your major and one in your minor. There are many many benefits, and most schools don't limit how many advisors you have.
   * If you get assigned a bad advisor at the start of freshman year DO NOT try to change and remove the original advisor. Especially if you will have to take classes from them. It can be seen as an insult and is hard to make fully inoffensive. If you have multiple though, they're not the end-all be-all of signing off on things for you. 
   * Multiple advisors means multiple people that can be asked to sign off on that last minute add drop form you need (saved me 3 times in the 2 years where I had two advisors).
   * Multiple perspectives on how to navigate the system, what classes are suited for you etc. Works especially well with two profs from the same department, especially if one went to school there or has been there for a long time. 
* CALL IN sick or missing class on important days or for classes that require attendance. (Mostly for small schools, where you know the prof)
   * Calling is the favored method of communication for many professors of older generations, so they'll often actually pick up the phone.
   * If you get voicemail, most (if not all) large systems like the university will have either send an email transcript of the message or an audio clip to the professor. They'll see it sooner usually cause they have to open it to see the contents.
   * Way better proof of needing to be out in a sincere little phone call than a short email. Especially good if you sound sick or in pain. Even if not, it somehow comes across less faked
* CALL your prof's office to see if they're around, or if their office hours are busy. Great way to get a quick question in without having to wait in a long office hours line, or hope your email gets seen.
   * If they're not there, decide if you want to leave a message or not. 
   * If they are there, and its office hours - ask if there's a lot of students waiting. If yes, ask if there's a better time to come in and talk to them, or see if you can just ask after class.  
* Course overrides are both a friend and a nemesis - they can help your schedule BUT make triple sure that you wont get too shafted by not having a requirement for a class you get an override for.
   * Some class pre-req's are actually a vague foundation that little to none of the material is based on, if you ask nicely some professors will sign you into the class and give an override of that requirement. Very useful, slightly dangerous. Apply with caution, and advice.

# Social and sundries

* Most schools have some sort of clubs fair in the first few weeks. GO TO IT. Look around, talk to people. No, no one is judging you for going alone, the whole point of a clubs fair is finding new groups of people with similar interests.
   * Pick a couple clubs that either interest you based on the people at the table, or on the actual topic of the club. Give yourself full permission to not like it and never go again, but go to the next meeting they have. People get that not all clubs are for everyone, I still have friends that I met in college freshman year just by trying out clubs. 
* The registrar's office is a vital place. A veritable hub of secret ways into classes that seem full. Always go in person when you need something, they know many tricks. They also have printed add/drop forms.
   * Remember the people that work the desk, they often enter course overrides by hand when registration opens, and if they like you, you may end up on top of the pile. 
* Don't feel like you HAVE to go to study sessions that friends invite you to. Sometimes they're wildly unproductive. 
   * I've never been one to learn well when there's a bunch of my friends in the room, so I would study by myself and occasionally go to study sessions to help friends or practice the material. Find your learning style and use that knowledge to be more effective in how you go about learning. Also, if applicable, tell your prof. Tell them that you're so sorry if you seem distracted in class, but you prefer to listen and doodle and then make notes from the text book later. Etc. 
* If you're unsure of when fun social stuff will come up PREEMPTIVELY do your homework.
   * Don't leave it till 10pm on a midnight deadline, only to find out everyone's meeting up in 15 min to go on some fun adventure. Do your homework between classes, before dinner etc. I did this all four years as much as I could and I got to go on a lot more last minute adventures than I would have. 
* IF you can manage it, have one day of the week as empty of classes as possible. Preferably somewhere in the middle. 
   * It gives time for errands, sleeping in a little, that essay thats due Friday, etc. Its a cushion day, and I recommend either Tuesday or Thursday since a lot of schools run classes that are MWF or T/Th. Tuesday is more for homework catch up if you know you're not a weekend homework person, and Thursday is more of a break in the week for the random stuff that comes up. At least in my experience. But consider it, its super nice just sanity wise too. 
* Consider getting a cheap monitor, keyboard, and mouse set up if you have a laptop. All you need is a usb hub and an hdmi cable to connect everything. 
   * Being able to have a reference AND your paper visible together is a beautiful beautiful thing. Or your math homework and Netflix, whatever floats your boat. 
* On a similar note, learn your context switching keys on your computer. Super helpful. See below for system:
   * Windows PC - alt + tab: switch between all open windows in order of most recent. Does not do it by program like mac. If it's open and separate it will be listed separately. Keep hitting tab to navigate on the little bar that pops up in the middle of your screen.
   * Mac - command + tab: switch between all open PROGRAMS. Will show the window for the front most open window of a program. 
   * Mac - command + \~: That's the tilde key, its right below the esc. This will switch between open windows of the program you're currently in. Like from the chrome window with my google doc to the one with my reference doc. 
* If you have a mac and HATE having windows maximized as much as I do, get the  [Spectacle app](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) to be able to use a couple easy keyboard commands to pick which side of the screen a window is put on, etc. Basically a way to have it work a little more like windows. Highly recommend.
* Attempt to log into to the staff wifi network and see if your school's staff wifi is locked to students. The one at my school wasn't, and it was significantly faster. 

# Some health/accommodation tips 

I have a bunch of allergies and other health issues that meant I couldn't eat cafeteria food, got a room to myself and some academic accommodations. I am no expert on any of this, but I did notice a few things, and I hope they can help some of you if you face similar circumstances. And as I said before, I'm here if anyone wants to talk or is having a hard time adjusting to dorm/college life with health challenges &lt;3

* If you have documented allergies, you can ask the accommodations office if they'll give you an academic accommodation so that you don't have to take a test while having a reaction. I only found this out junior year, and it was EXTREMELY helpful. Don't abuse it, but not having to take an 8am calc test when you can only kinda walk and barely think is a huge relief.
* It doesn't hurt to ask - see if they'll give you academic accommodations if you have anything health related on file. Could be as simple as more time to get between classes, or getting to skip the waitlist for the only section of a class that isn't 8am because you can't get food from the cafeteria that early. 
* They will clean the air vents to your room if you ask. Dust is not good for anyone, even if you're not really allergic to it. Just call maintenance and ask, or ask accommodations if you have something related that they know about. 
* Regardless of what your school has on file, TELL your professors as early on as possible that you have health stuff that affects your x, y and z academically. You don't need to tell them what it is (and I advise you don't since they can't form as many judgements about it), I would usually just say ""health conditions and allergies"". Even if you don't have something official, they're more likely to be understanding if you miss class or need extra help with something. 
* I was able to not have a roommate all 4 years of living in a dorm, so know that's entirely possible for most schools to do and I would suggest asking about it if you have severe allergies or something else that would make it helpful. 
* Just keep asking for help, going to different offices etc until they give you the accommodations that you need. 

Hope it helped!

19,Mewchiiii,1628534556,/r/college/comments/p17mms/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_academic/,"During the fall semester I had a concussion that the campus doctor helped treat, and I’ve also been using the campus help center for past sexual/emotional abuse so they’ve been loosely helping me with a few things. They said they would help connect me to off campus mental help but never really did. In the spring semester my grades really started to struggle and about 2 weeks before finals I ended up having an anxiety induced episode of amnesia and I was hospitalized for 7 days and I really just couldn’t catch up after I was discharged and I struggled a lot and ended up failing all of my finals and all of my classes. I decided to try taking summer classes to see if it would help me at all, but when I went to register for classes this fall I was told I couldn’t and I’ve been placed under academic suspension because my grades got that low in the spring. I have an appointment in a few days to try and appeal it, and I want to try and get it lifted for another semester because I was hospitalized for fucking amnesia, I had literally woken up on top of a parking garage off campus with no memory of how I got there or who I was and I was picked up by police; so of course I failed my classes afterwards. I was on medication after my discharge and I was sleepy all the time and I couldn’t complete my work or study hard enough to replace a semester’s worth of knowledge for 4 finals in just a few days. I also know that concussions can have more long lasting effects as well, and I’m writing this because I’m curious if anyone has any thoughts on if they think I have good chances of getting it appealed. I’m traveling across the country back to campus in just a few days, so a suspension would be devastating because my family is pretty strict and I’m so anxious thinking about whether or not it will be lifted.

20,Jumpsaye,1625790207,/r/college/comments/ogk4gj/how_to_get_out_of_a_rut_and_get_back_to_your/,"## What’s a rut?

Just to be clear: a rut is not burnout. It’s not depression. Those are rather serious and you should consult an *actual* professional who specializes in those areas vs. reading *Musings &amp; Perspectives.*

**My personal definition of a rut is:**

&gt;A state in which you’re not at your optimal, peak self and performing at your best.

It can be in the context of work and / or personal.

**Some symptoms:**

* Loss of motivation or excitement
* Unable to focus or be as productive
* Uninspired and lack of creative thought
* Activities that were once energizing aren’t anymore

After working through this for a few months, I managed to reflect and develop a few behaviors and attitudes to pull myself out.

**Here’s my approach:**

## 🧘🏼‍♀️ Optimize your physiology

It’s ridiculous how often we forget the basics of good, healthy habits that are the source of our mood and energy.

This list may slightly differ from person-to-person, but should be consistent for most.

* **Sleep 7.5+ hours a night and** [**practice good sleeping habits**](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-why-we-sleep/#:~:text=In%20our%20Why%20We%20Sleep,quantity%20and%20quality%20of%20sleep.&amp;text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20sleep,or%20medical%20interventions%20can%20provide.)**.** The importance of sleep is well documented. [Here’s an entire book on the subject](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144324/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;qid=1625696324&amp;sr=8-1).
* **Drink 2 liters of water daily and eat a balanced diet consisting of multiple servings of fruit and vegetables.** Pretty straight forward — this is the fuel for our engine of a body.
* **Exercise 3-4x a week — do a balance of high intensity exercise and slow, steady cardio.**
* **Minimize alcohol, sodium, and processed foods (sugar, saturated fat).** Alcohol is the biggest enemy to productivity. [Try giving it up for a month.](https://thehustle.co/6-things-learned-from-not-drinking-for-2-years)

Most of us are fortunate enough to be able to hit the items above. All it takes is discipline.

If you’re in a rut, the first thing I’d do is assess how you’re doing on the dimensions above. And if you’re falling short, give yourself just *one week* where you sleep, eat, drink, and exercise well — and see how you feel after that.

Quite often, it’s the lack of sleep, exercise, or discipline on what I consume. Good sleep is by far the most important contributor of productivity and optimal performance for me.

&amp;#x200B;

## 🛀🏼 Recharge and reduce

Josh Waitzkin is a classic high-performer and pretty incredible human. He’s a Chess International Master (IM), ranked at 2,480 ELO. A black belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, under world champion Marcelo Garcia. And a Tai Chi World Cup champion.[ I write about him here.](https://www.andrew.today/p/two-ideas-to-improve-your-meta-learning)

In his book, [‘The Art of Learning’,](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=art+of+learning&amp;qid=1625697162&amp;sr=8-1) he states that over the long run, **we should alternate between modes of intense, hard work, and complete relaxation.**

&gt;**Two takeaways here:**  
You absolutely need breaks  
When you take a break to recharge — you need to completely relax (and not half-ass it)

**Ideas on recharging:**

* **Take your vacation and Paid Time Off (PTO) days liberally.** We don’t realize how badly we need time off work until we start feeling the symptoms. By then, it may be too late. Think of vacation days as preventative vs. taking them to solve an overworking problem.
* **Schedule time for a digital detox.** Pick a Sunday and put your phone on *Do Not Disturb* for the entire day. No social media, digital messaging, or notifications. It’s **your** time.
* If you’re an introvert, schedule time for undisturbed solitude; if you’re an extrovert, create opportunities for energizing conversations with new folks.
* **Practice stillness.** Block off time to do absolutely *nothing*. Reflect on this: when was the last time you were bored? With smart phones, 5G internet, and Instagram — it is literally *impossible* to be bored. There’s always something to do, which is a shame as boredom is often the precursor to creative thoughts and new ideas.

The other related idea here is to **reduce** and take things off your plate. Once a month, do a time and energy audit to evaluate how you spend your time and energy. Relate this back to your goals and cut what doesn’t fit.

Time is your most valuable resource and sometimes the most productive thing is to say **no.**

&amp;#x200B;

## 🙇🏽‍♂️ Seek input and inspiration

**I recently came across a brilliant Tweet:**

[https://twitter.com/kylehagge/status/1402602261751209991](https://twitter.com/kylehagge/status/1402602261751209991)

When I’m not inspired to write or think of new ideas, **it’s usually because I’m not reading, listening, or watching enough productive content.**

And by that I mean reading **blogs, newsletters, and books**; listening to **podcasts, interviews, and music**; watching **documentaries, TED talks, and speeches**.

I’m almost immediately pulled out of my creative rut once I start consuming productive content again.

Referencing the Tweet above: if you’re not dot collecting (input), you won’t be able to dot connect (output). Assess your information diet — perhaps you need to read, watch, or listen more.

The same goes for meeting new people.

I love meeting new people through [coffee chats](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/art-virtual-coffee-chat-andrew-yeung/), social networking events, or just by random. Good conversation is inspiring and energizing, especially if you have shared values or a common mission.

If you’re uninspired, reach out to someone you admire and pick their brain. Ask questions on their life and career journey. Don’t know how to do that? Reply to this and I’ll share a template that I’ve used with hundreds of people.

&amp;#x200B;

## 🥰 Practice self-compassion and self-love

This last part may go against the point of the entire article, **but perhaps being in a rut is fine after all.**

We need rest and we deserve a break. Maybe we’ve been working too hard and this is our natural reflex forcing us to slow down and take a breath.

When this happens, it’s hard to silence our inner critic — which will often question why we’re slowing down and prevent it from happening.

Practically, there’s an exercise called **‘Metta’** that Tim Ferriss discusses with Leo Babauta. [**Here’s how you do it.**](https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-do-metta-january-2014/)

&gt;“… but with heart-centered meditations like *metta*, and I’m sure you’re familiar with that one. Loving-kindness meditation. And so I started practicing with that and that one, **for those unfamiliar with it, is basically this thing where you picture someone else or a group of people and you start to wish an end to their suffering, for example, or wish happiness upon them.** And it’s just a lovely little meditation. So you start thinking these thoughts, “May they be happy?” And you think about your loved ones in pain and suffering. “And may they be happy?” Think about other people in the world who are suffering. “May they be happy?” It’s just a really beautiful meditation. “  
**— Leo Babauta, Writer at** [**zen habits**](https://zenhabits.net/)

If you’re more empathetic, compassionate, and caring toward others, you’re more empathetic, compassionate, and caring toward yourself. And vice versa.

I set aside 45 minutes a month to do this exercise, and it’s been great for quietening my inner critic in times of rest.

&amp;#x200B;

### 🙏 Appreciation &amp; Support

**I had two motivations for writing this article:**

* First, I wanted to reflect on this experience to provide myself with a playbook of how to approach similar, future situations.
* Second, to share my approach with friends, colleagues, and peers out there who may have felt the same way. I hope this is helpful and wish you the best on your journey.

Thank you for taking the time to read. This was one I was particularly passionate about, and found energizing to write.

**I’d really love your thoughts and feedback.** How do you deal with being in a rut?

22,dragonyr,1622759828,/r/college/comments/nrq079/if_you_are_experiencing_a_mental_health_crisis_or/," We don’t talk about mental health issues enough. I had a relative who had clinical depression for over 30 years, and his symptoms include extreme emotions (super happy or supper sad or super angry or super fearful), insomnia, anxiety, and sometimes even hallucinations (he grab his passport and think he needs to run away somewhere to stay safe). I used to think that he’s just a selfish, impatient, and ill-tempered person. But over the years I’ve come to accept that a lot of this is due to his depression. Not everyone in the family has accepted it unfortunately, even though we all know he is diagnosed with depression.

Anyway, I wrote a post regarding how to find mental health resources and what are the options out there, because a lot of people don’t know where to find them apparently. I hope this will help many of you. It’s important to figure out mental health issues early on (especially in college when you are away from family support). My relative has been on medication for decades. Can you imagine if he was not properly diagnosed??? :O Please let me know what you think or anything you think should be added to it:

&amp;#x200B;

Mental health in college students was at a crisis point even *before* the pandemic started. But COVID-19 has exacerbated the amount of stress, anxiety, depression, and other diagnosable mental illnesses in college students. Many students still don’t know where to find mental health resources in college, though.

Keep reading for:

* a snapshot of mental health trends on college campuses, before and during COVID-19
* college campus mental health services and how to find them
* off-campus mental health resources
* how and why to get disability accommodations for a mental illness
* how to manage a mental illness in college

Use these resources, and share this information with someone else who is struggling.

But before we go any further:

## If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or need immediate support:

* Call your school’s counseling services center. The phone number can be found on your school’s student affairs website.
* Call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room if you are in danger of hurting yourself or others.
* Call school police, who can escort you to counseling centers or the emergency room. Calling them won’t get you into trouble, or anything negative. They are simply there to get you the help you need.
* Contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, or use Lifeline Chat (suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) if you cannot call.
* Text BRAVE to 741-741 to reach the National Alliance on Mental Illness crisis chat line.

## Mental Health By the Numbers

Even before the pandemic hit, college students' mental health was on the decline.

In 2019, studies conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness showed: 

* 25% of students have been diagnosed or treated for a mental health condition in the past year (2018)
* 35% of college students are struggling with mental health problems
* 27% of college students in the US are diagnosed with depression
* 11% of college students have been diagnosed with anxiety
* 57.7% of college students confessed that they have felt “overwhelming anxiety” in the prior year
* 50% of students admit to having suicidal thoughts
* Only 9% of college students decide to seek professional help on campus
* 73.1% of counseling center directors report a significant increase of severe mental health issues in college students

These statistics show the upward trend of mental illness in colleges, but don’t reflect how COVID-19 has shifted the mental health outlook.

### How has COVID-19 affected college students' mental health and wellbeing?

According to Active Minds, a nonprofit dedicated to spreading mental health awareness and advocacy efforts, conducts biannual surveys measuring the state of mental health in college students.

After surveying 2086 college students about the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in April 2020, they found the following:

* 1 in 5 college students say their mental health has *significantly* worsened due to COVID-19
* 80% of college students say COVID-19 has negatively impacted their mental health
* 55% of college students would not know where to go if they or someone they knew needed mental health services right away

## On-Campus Mental Health Resources: What’s available?

Many campuses will host students on campus and provide regular services again as everyone continues to get the vaccines available. But the delivery of mental health resources may vary, with many campuses offering telehealth services in addition to, or instead of, in-person appointments.

In general, though, most college campuses offer these mental health services:

* consultations on academic issues or personal stressors
* drop-in hours for students who really need to work through high stress or crisis situations
* short-term individual therapy
* group therapy (usually lasting six to eight weeks, or throughout the semester)
* psychiatric care (on a case-by-case basis)
* assistance with finding more permanent treatment providers (this service is known as care coordination)
* coping skills workshops (to manage anxiety, stress, feelings of depression, etc.)

If you’re not sure what all your campus has to offer, use this campus mental health service search tool to find out (ulifeline.org/get\_help\_now).

## How to Access On-Campus Mental Health Services

### Drop-In Student Mental Health Services

If your campus has drop-in mental health services, then you don’t need to schedule an appointment. All you have to do is walk into (or call) your campus wellness center during designated drop-in hours and ask to speak to someone about whatever’s on your mind. 

Just make sure to check your school’s website to find out whether to physically go or call campus mental health services — social distancing policies are changing constantly. 

Schools may also continue to offer telehealth services after COVID-19, so you could still have that option, if it’s more convenient for you.

Use drop-in mental health services when you:

* are in a mental health crisis
* need short term support as you work through distressing emotions
* need help making a big decision (like whether to drop a class or move back home)

Once you are connected with a counseling professional, they will usually talk you through your situation and teach you some coping skills to handle distress in the future. 

They will talk to you for however long you need, but drop-in sessions usually last around an hour at most.

They may schedule an appointment to speak with you again, but usually drop-in appointments are one-and-done.

### Therapy for College Students

If you have been experiencing intense sadness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, depression, irregular eating or exercise habits, or any other problems you would like long-term help with, you will have to schedule an intake appointment with a counseling professional to talk about getting more help.

You can find out how to schedule an appointment on your school’s student affairs webpage. They will most likely require you to fill out some forms before your appointment. These usually include questions about your concerns and any previous mental/physical health problems you have faced.

They may ask you for insurance information. **If you don’t have insurance, still schedule the campus intake appointment** and talk to your school about your options.

During your appointment, you and a trained professional will decide how to meet your individual needs.

You may receive short-term individual therapy with someone on campus. Usually, counselors work with students for three to eight sessions to process short-term stressors. 

You may also be directed towards group therapy, which usually lasts 6-8 weeks. Groups may specialize in anxiety support, emotion management, substance use, graduate student issues, etc. These will vary by institution.

However, if you need more long-term care, campus counselors may connect you to mental health professionals in your community. Counseling centers do this to keep clinicians available for other students who need them.

Your counselor will draw up a list of providers in the community that accept your insurance (if you have any.) They will also help you email, call, and follow up if you are afraid to make the call, or forget to.

### Psychiatric Services

Some campuses have licensed psychiatrists available to prescribe medications for students who require them.

If you are not already taking medications to manage a mental illness, you may be able to set up an appointment with a campus psychiatrist.

But you may have to wait a while before you can get an appointment, as campus psychiatrists are in relatively high demand.

Campus psychiatrists will most likely assist you in finding someone in the community to help you manage new medications.

## Off-Campus Mental Health Resources for College Students

When it comes to getting help, you aren’t limited to what your campus can offer. You’re also not limited to traditional mental health services.

### Individual Services

You don’t need to have a referral from someone on campus to meet with a professional in your area. 

Search for therapists, psychiatrists, treatment centers, and support groups using Psychology Today or Mental Health Match. 

You can filter results by specialization, availability, gender, religion, sexuality, and treatment practice to find someone who: 

* has experience treating your personal issues and/or mental illness
* you are comfortable being around (e.g. a woman may prefer to have a woman for a therapist)
* understands your values (e.g. your religion or philosophy)
* has availability at the time you need it

Consider your academic and biological schedule when you make your first appointment: are you able to consistently wake up in the morning? Are you sure you will always be available at the time you schedule your sessions for?

Missed appointments don’t usually get covered by insurance, and many professionals have a late fee, cancellation policy, etc. Be mindful of this when you schedule that first appointment.

### Online Support Groups

Online support groups are widely available now, in part because of COVID-19. They offer access to support for people who usually can’t afford to travel or pay for traditional therapy.

This is an extensive list of online support groups (mhanational.org/find-support-groups) from Mental Health America.

### Self Care and Coping Skills Resources

Self care is any activity that you intentionally do to take care of your mental, physical, and/or emotional health. Practicing self care will help you manage your stress and calm yourself down when you need to.

It’s not a replacement for professional help. But it can really improve your wellbeing if you incorporate self care into your routine.

This can be anything from a gentle walk, to doing something creative, to calling a friend just to talk.

Self care is not staying up late watching something on Netflix. It’s more intentional and restorative than that.

### COVID-19 Mental Health Resources

There are so many resources out there for students affected by COVID-19.

The Jed Foundation, which was founded by parents who lost their son to suicide, is dedicated to raising mental health awareness, suicide prevention, and providing mental health resources to young adults, especially college students.

They have provided a massive COVID-19 resource guide to help students cope throughout the pandemic.

Even as things get back to normal, the coping skills you learn during a crisis like COVID-19 can be used for the rest of your life. 

You’re going to be stressed over lots of things, so the skills never become irrelevant.

## How to Manage Mental Illness While in College

### Be proud of yourself.

You are handling school and your mental health, at the same time, and that’s impressive! You’re doing great things and you really should be proud of yourself.

### Leave any embarrassment behind.

If you think you’re the only student on campus struggling with mental illness, you’re so wrong. 20% of college students have a diagnosable mental illness, remember?

It’s normal to struggle, normal to ask for help, *and* normal to take medication for an illness. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

So try as hard as you can to leave any shame or embarrassment you feel about your mental illness in the past.

### Consider disability accommodations.

While you absolutely can succeed in school with a mental illness, you probably need different things than your peers to reach that success.

Your school (and the federal government) understands this, which is why disability accommodations exist. There are physical and mental disability accommodations available at every learning institution.

Mental health accommodations include, but are not limited to:

* testing at an alternate location to minimize distractions
* extra time to test, which helps minimize anxiety
* an extended number of absences (within reason)
* access to peer notes or audio recordings of notes
* more time to complete assignments (within reason)
* assistance with assignments and scheduling during hospitalization

These do not all apply in the remote learning setting, of course. Testing conditions, especially, have changed in the remote learning setting, for obvious reasons.

Students usually request and use accommodations if they are having trouble focusing, adjusting to new medications, or managing symptoms of a disorder (such as fatigue or insomnia.)

Start by looking up your school’s disability services department information. You will probably have to schedule an intake appointment with someone from the disability services department. 

Before your appointment, you will need to provide documentation of your disability, including:

* the name of the professional who diagnosed you
* any medications you are currently on
* symptoms you are experiencing
* prior hospitalizations due to your illness

At your appointment, they will ask what accommodations you think you need. 

It’s probably not a great idea to go in and ask to never have to attend class or to be able to turn in any assignment late without discussing it with a professor first.

Be reasonable with your requests. 

You will probably have a meeting with someone from disability resources every semester, so you can reevaluate accommodations as needed.

If you get accommodations for your disability, you do have to disclose the fact that you have a disability to any professor whose class you wish to use your accommodations in. The disclosure process is regulated by disability services.

For example, let’s say you have a calculus class that tests. 

You have test anxiety, which is why you have testing accommodations like extra time and testing in a private room.

If you want to use your accommodations in this class, you have to tell them that you have a disability, and the accommodation, *but* you don’t have to tell them that you have test anxiety.

You will most likely have an online account with disability services, where you can choose which professors and TAs to send disability/accommodation disclosure documents to.  

### Create an open line of communication with your professors and TAs.

You don’t have to tell any professor anything specific about your mental illness.

But it can be helpful to tell them about any symptoms you may be experiencing, any problems you foresee in the future, and anything they can do to help.

For example, if you know that your depression gets worse in the winter, let your professors know ahead of time that you may have some difficulty getting to class on time or finishing assignments promptly.

Professors and TAs know how stressful college is, and if you don’t use your illness a san excuse to procrastinate, then they will sympathize with you.

### Manage medications (if you take any.)

College is generally a little hectic and you’ve probably got a lot going on right now.

But if you take medications for a mental illness, then making sure you get the right dose at the right time is your first priority, always.

Set timers to remind yourself to take medications, pick up scripts, and go to appointments. 

Ask roommates and parents to help you remember, if you need someone else to remind you.

### Stick to a routine (seriously, it helps.)

You've heard it before, several times — eat, sleep, drink water, and study at regular intervals, and your life will really improve.

By now it almost sounds cliché, but a balanced routine (or as balanced as possible) can change your life.

Just getting up in the morning and having a filling breakfast can make all the difference in your day. 

### Get extra help with your courses when you need it.

If you notice that you’re slipping up because you missed class or couldn’t focus, take action now.

Get a classmate or hire an affordable online tutor to work with you 1-on-1 in whatever subject you’re struggling with. 

Make sure to play catch up as soon as you notice you’re slipping, so you don’t fall even more behind.

### Practice self-compassion.

You face different challenges than many of your peers. Even other people with the same mental illness struggle in unique ways.

So you’re not all going to succeed on the same level and at the same pace.

You may not get fantastic grades if you have anxiety flare ups. You may not be very present in class if you’re adjusting to new bipolar medication. You may have to take a semester off to get treatment for an eating disorder.

Acknowledge the struggle, and be proud that you showed up to school in spite of it. 

And know that you will succeed if you continue working on your mental health.

## You can succeed, even if you’re struggling right now.

Thousands of people with mental illness graduated last year. Thousands of students will do it this year.

I only have 2 friends who I can say are true and I can rely on. I drifted apart from acquaintances and a few classmates I used to talk to, maybe because we were only friends due to our proximity to each other. 

I feel like no one really knows me--that I exist, or cares about me. I do feel like a ghost sometimes. Because of this I started comparing myself to people who seem to have a solid college group, get a lot of support from their friends whenever they post online, are active in organizations, etc. It's been really toxic and I do feel lonely sometimes. I think coming out of the pandemic, I'm gonna be a lonely and depressed 20-something year old who doesn't have much social capital and friends to hang out with. The thought of it makes me anxious/sad, because I'm gonna go on social media and see people hanging out again, going out, etc. And I'm probably gonna be all alone in my room on fridays

I'm a bit sad about this because it's not what I expected for my time in college. I'm in my dream uni right now and expected only good things at the start, but this was not what I anticipated.

27,charleyeve,1619317257,/r/college/comments/mxyqvz/stick_it_out_for_another_2_years_or_transfer/,"Hello!

Relevant context: College is much cheaper in my country, so finance is not a huge consideration, undergraduate degrees are 3 years long, the academic year runs from March to November and there's no covid.

I'm 2/3 through my first semester at my current university and I'm miserable here. I really don't like the city- it's very much a student town and has a massive culture of binge drinking and other things I'm not very in to(Within NZ, it's just known as the party university, you generally just come here to party, or to attend the med school because there's only 2 in the country) I don't fall into either the party or med demographic here, I'm only here because they gave me the largest scholarship offer and wouldn't have considered it otherwise, and because of that I really don't fit in here. I wasn't quick enough to make a friend group in the first week, and everyone has stuck with their groups since then so I haven't had much of a social life and have struggled to make friends. I don't have much to offer as a friend because I don't like to get drunk or party. 

I think it's partially my dislike of the area that has made it harder to make friends- when I walk to class I have to dodge vomit and smashed bottles on the pavement, and overall it is a conservative area, and I've found that to be a hard transition coming from a really liberal city. I've joined several sports teams and clubs but I've found it really hard to find people I connect with. This university is also the lowest ranked in the country for my degree and I've found that the teaching quality reflects that. 

The option I'm weighing up is sticking it out for the rest of first year and then transferring to the university in my home town- much higher ranked for computer science and an area with a lot more links to the industry.  The city has a culture that feels so much more me. I've looked into it and with my academic standing I can transfer my papers and start from second year. I'd be losing out on the scholarship I have here, but most of that money was a fee waiver/accomadation for first year which I wouldn't need to pay back. I have enough money saved to transfer and live comfortably, and I've managed to keep a really good job in my hometown that pays well over minimum wage and would be a huge help and an opportunity that I couldn't expect to get here. 

My only worry is whether it would be difficult to start second year when everyone has already been there- would it still be possible to make friends? I'm miserable here but I don't know if it's worth the logistics of transferring and whether it would look bad for me to have been too weak to last more than a year at my current university.

Despite me working and volunteering with the football team and the athletic department throughout my college career (which connects with my major), I was told by my parents and a few professionals that my college major is usually competitive in nature. Even though I agree that college sport teams and professional sport leagues are hard to get into, depending on the situation, I still believe that I may have an equal opportunity, only if I put all of my focus towards my future career goals.

However, my main problem includes me not going above and beyond, along with not being ambitious/motivated enough when it comes to networking and reaching out to people within my field of study. I was also told that I should've had something lined up after I graduate, but due to Covid, along with having an easy-going/go with the flow personality (which is an excuse IMO), I haven't used LinkedIn or Indeed as often until as of recently when I was told that I should start looking for ""better paying"" jobs or any opportunities that connect more towards my major since my graduation date is quickly approaching.

Furthermore, my future career revolves around working behind the scenes of college or professional sport teams. Stadium work, preparation/planning, and equipment management are my career interests.

I'm just wondering if I still have a good opportunity since I'm starting later than most gradates? As of today, I'm using LinkedIn and Indeed more often and I plan on contacting more people with similar college majors as me, so maybe I'm starting to turn a corner?

On an extra note, I was told by some of my friends that everyone is different when it comes to their own lives and that I should focus more on my own career path rather than comparing myself to others.

29,morenxlife,1618780693,/r/college/comments/mtlqj0/how_to_find_an_internship_advice_from_an/,"I’m making this because:

A) I’ve seen a lot of panicked posts realizing summer is quickly approaching and they haven’t really begun their internship search OR have received a lot of rejections.
B) In general, there are a lot of posts asking about where to look for internships.
C) I’m procrastinating on my homework. 

I’m not positioning myself as an all-knowing authority and I *hope* this doesn’t come across as unwanted, condescending advice. I’m sharing internship strategies, because as a student who was the first in my family to go through the American education system I didn’t have connections or anyone to show me how to do undertake the intimidating behemoth that is the internship process. 

So here are some of the tips and tricks I found out through trial and error: 

*Warning: a lot of these rely on LinkedIn so I recommend making an account. The first strategy I list is the one most helpful for me, but after that I don’t list it in any particular order of importance/effectiveness. 

Finding Companies and Internships

	1.	Please please please read this point carefully, because I never see this strategy recommended! There are organizations that are dedicated to creating internship opportunities for *specific* communities. There are organizations dedicated to placing people based on their identity (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, first generation, low-income, etc.), it can be location specific (ex: students from Oregon or who go to school in Oregon), it can be for people underrepresented in a specific field or industry (this depends entirely on the field), or a combination. In Portland, OR, Emerging Leaders PDX is a program that works hard to place students of color living in/attending school in Oregon with companies in the Portland/Portland metro/Vancouver area. Try and look for internships specific to your identity/community! 
	2.	Make a list of all the relevant organizations and companies in your college/university/home’s town/city/area. This is *super* helpful for finding places you can intern or work at during the school year, which is when the internship application process tends to be wayyyyyy less competitive. I did this, and I was able to go back and forth between my internship and classes fairly easily (the workload with an internship + school + anything else you have going on can be rough though, so keep that in mind). 
	3.	If you’re an upperclassmen I recommend repeating this process for all the places you’re interested in living after you graduate/wherever your graduate school is. 
	4.	LinkedIn is great for finding out where your peers work or where employees at your dream company have worked. I highly recommend combing through your LinkedIn network (or searching up your classmates if you don’t have a very large one) and going to their “Experience” section. After this, start cataloging the companies/organizations they’ve been involved in that interest you and follow those companies on LinkedIn. You can set up an alert for the company if they post a new job/internship opportunity on their LinkedIn page, though not all organizations use LinkedIn as their primary job posting site so make sure to check their actual website frequently.
	5.	This also works in reverse! Find all the companies you’re interested in interning/working at and find current employers and current interns under the organization page’s “Employees” tab. Make sure to look at what organizations they’ve worked/interned at before where they’re at now. I’m not saying to totally imitate someone’s career but A) it helps you understand what kind of experience your preferred company is looking for, and B) it will help you learn about other companies in your industry you may not have heard of before.
	6.	You should also try finding previous interns. This is a little harder since they aren’t featured under an organization’s LinkedIn page, but try searching up “company name + intern.” You can get more creative with the keywords if you’re looking at specific departments within the company. Some companies also publish the names of their previous interns on their website, so check there too. You may be wondering, “Why should I care about former interns at x company?” It’s not definitive, but looking at their career path after the internship indicates how much this internship opportunity helped them land their next job AND how many networking, mentorship, and professional opportunities the internship provides.  If you don’t ultimately end up working for a company full time after interning there, you’d still want to know how an internship at x company would benefit your career in the short and long term. And again, this will probably expose you to more companies in the field you haven’t heard of. 
	7.	Don’t forget to send LinkedIn invitations (I’ve never personalized them and it’s never been an issue but if you want to personalize it go ahead) to all the students/interns you’ve basically just stalked on LinkedIn. This is so when you apply to these companies you can reach out and ask for application/interview process advice and chat with them about their internship experience. 
	8.	You may feel embarrassed to admit you’re having a hard time finding an internship but don’t be afraid to make a LinkedIn post that says you’re looking for an internship in “x field” for “x term.” People can be very kind and give you advice or help get your foot in the door. I did this once and someone responded, leading me to my current internship! 
	9.	Take advantage of the resources your university has to offer - after all you ARE paying for it whether or not you actually utilize their services. Don’t just talk to career services (but yes, please check them out), colleges and universities offer so much more than that! Be sure to check if your school has some sort of major or college specific placement pipeline (like MECOP for engineering students); check calendars to see when they host career fairs, student-faculty mixers (this may not be a direct path to an internship, but it can help you find mentorship or get into a research position), and similar events; speak to professors and see if they have any connections or recommendations; speak to your major/college advisor and they may be able to provide you a list of organizations other students have interned at or have their own set of connections; connect with other people in your major/college and ask them about their internship experiences. 
	10.	Leadership and Mentorship programs - through your university or external organizations - are not only great for professional development, but they also connect you with other people in your field who are older and have more experience and/or allow you to meet other students with similar aspirations. Some programs may also have a direct pipeline to companies (ex: after you complete this program we will try to match you with an internship at x companies) or you can utilize connections you made to get referrals and other things that help with the internship application process. 
	11.	Use industry specific platforms. When internship and job hunting I’ve noticed people tend to recommend LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. which are useful platforms. HOWEVER, these are huuuuge sites that are inclusive of many industries and niches which makes sifting through job postings very time consuming. Ask coworkers, classmates, advisors, mentors, peers, and career center employees about the best job site platform for your industry - I especially recommend this for more niche majors/interests that have fewer job opportunities (like if you’re looking to go into museum curation). 
	12.	If you’re interested in micro-internships, which focus on short term projects go ahead and check out Parker Dewey. Personally, I haven’t tried this but my university has a partnership with them and there were some interesting projects available when I perused their site. 

When should I start looking for companies/internships?

This is entirely industry specific. Yes, large tech and business companies often start recruiting 2 terms/a year ahead (ex: apply in the fall of 2020 to secure a summer 2021 internship) but plenty of other fields and smaller companies do not practice this. If you didn’t apply in the fall for a summer internship or were rejected, there’s no reason to give up for the rest of the school year.

For humanities and some STEM majors, plenty of companies and organizations publish their internship applications late Winter to mid Spring (February to April). Is it nerve wracking to see soooo many students creating their LinkedIn posts announcing where they’ll be spending their summer in *December*? Yes, but that doesn’t mean it affects your internship opportunities at all. 

I’m studying PoliSci and Environmental Policy and I *just* secured my summer internship during the second week of April even though I started looking for internships/applying in January. My best friend is studying biochemistry (and focuses pretty much just on research) and has been applying from early March - April, and has not yet secured their summer internship. So please please please don’t lose hope just yet if you’re freaking out! 

As a general rule of thumb, I recommend starting an *intensive* search about 6 months before you want to intern (if you want a summer internship that starts June, this means start looking in January) so you can begin your application process early. 

Of course, adjust this schedule to fit your needs, but again, I just want to provide reassurance there’s no “right time” to start this process. When you’re not looking intensively - like just creating a running list of companies you might intern or work at someday - try to update this year round so you don’t have to make a mad dash every new internship season. 

I’m a Political Science and Environmental Policy major with minors in Public Health and Ethnic Studies who’s mostly interned at non-profits and government agencies, so I’m aware some of the advice I listed may be more helpful for humanities majors but I tried to be as broad as I could. If anyone has specific questions for polisci/public policy major please comment and I can try to answer. :) 

If this was helpful please let me know! I’m planning on making a whole Google doc (that will be completely free to access, I’m not trying to profit or anything) about this because I felt like all the advice available online was pretty generic and honestly not super helpful.

30,doyourealize__,1618409722,/r/college/comments/mqrh9i/question_i_took_an_exam_without_cheating_but/,"Hi!

So I took an exam recently through Canvas where we had to download a file and upload the completed exam file. It was timed. 

The exam was open to take from 8am-12pm. I accessed my online textbook through McGraw-Hill (not connect, just an e-book) until 8:30am bc I still needed to study. 

I didn’t access the textbook at all while actually taking the exam, but I guess I’m just paranoid about that time overlap from the exam being “open” at 8:00am, but me still looking at the textbook until 8:30am. I didn’t begin the exam until 8:30am, but the textbook webpage wasn’t logged out on my iPad. Instead, I had just put it away. 

Does anyone know if McGraw-Hill keeps access logs of when normal ebooks are accessed and sends to the school? 

I have severe test anxiety and generalized anxiety, so I guess I’m not sure if i’m being overtly paranoid. 

I studied really hard and got the highest grade in the class (how it usually works with my anxiety, I plan for the worst but perform okay) but I’m worried it’ll flag something? Am I being paranoid and is this just my anxiety? It’s been messing with my sleep :(

31,Jumpsaye,1617754232,/r/college/comments/mlpms8/how_to_learn_and_study_more_effectively_with/,"Sometimes, I can't believe that I spent four years in university writing proofs for macroeconomic theories, building quantitative financial models, and learning about why people love Apple.

I can easily say that the knowledge required for my work today is vastly different from what I studied back then.

While the content was ...interesting, the real value I gained were the systems I developed:

* **Systems of learning** to improve my meta-learning – my ability to learn new things.
* **Systems of organization** to optimize how I prioritize my time and energy.
* **Systems of relationships** to build a professional and personal network.

**I used to ‘brute-force’ my learning** — I’d maximize frequency and repetition on a given activity, and assume that the volume would result in accelerated learning. While this method works up to a certain level, it’s inevitable that you’ll hit a plateau.

While I strongly believe that **there is no substitution for hard work,** I also recognize that effective methods to learn more quickly (and deeply) exist.

In this article, I’ll be talking about two systems, developed by the high-performing polymaths: **Josh Waitzkin** and **Richard Feynman.**

...

Mastering Level One

Josh Waitzkin is a pretty incredible human. He’s a Chess International Master (IM), ranked at 2,480 ELO. A black belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, under world champion Marcelo Garcia. And a Tai Chi World Cup champion.

He’s managed to place in the 99.9th percentile for three separate disciplines — in less than four decades. Most people don’t achieve a single one.

One of his meta-learning frameworks is what I like to call **‘Mastering Level One’**. The intention is to exhaustively master the basics, or the ‘first’ level of a new concept, before moving on to the next stage.

**This takes a ton of discipline.** Does any of this sound familiar?

* **In the gym —** wanting to lift more weight or try new, flashy exercises from TikTok – prior to learning compound movements, how to warm up, and good form.
* **Martial arts —** learning the flowery, extravagant techniques prior to the basics: stance, rhythm, balance, and awareness.
* **Cooking** — cooking a gourmet wild mushroom and truffle risotto as your first dish, prior to mastering key elements and techniques, like [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830)

Or maybe it’s just me.

The idea is to start with the most simple scenarios to create an understanding of the principles without noise getting in the way. By placing yourself in situations with highly reduced complexity, you can deeply internalize the basic concepts of the skill.

&gt;“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times”  
**— Bruce Lee**

How to apply this:

Identify **Level One** of the skills you’re looking to learn. This will involve some research and reflection, but the more deeply you think about your learning, the more effective and intentional your progress will be.

**Some examples:**

* **Writing:** mastering basic grammar and sentence structure vs. convoluted, lavish, and pompous lexicon that emits no meaning (see what I did there?)
* **Public speaking:** working on general confidence, setting the stage, and being comfortable in your own skin vs. incorporating tactical elements, such as telling disconnected jokes and stories.
* **Data analytics:** understanding general math and statistics vs. learning random Excel formulas.

This may seem intuitive at first. *Of course, I’d start with the basics.*

But, how much time and energy do you really spend on level one before excitement and impatience take over?

Slow down. Focus, and truly master the fundamentals. Then, proceed to the next stage.

If you’d like to learn more, I’d recommend his book [“The Art of Learning”](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465).

Using the Feynman Technique

**Richard Feynman** was a brilliant scientist who pioneered an entire field of quantum electrodynamics. In the 1940s, he invented the Feynman diagram which brought visual clarification to the enigmatic behavior of subatomic particles. He has also heavily influenced the fields of nanotechnology, quantum computing, and particle physics.

Honestly, I don’t know what any of that stuff is. **But — he’s probably:**

1. Pretty damn smart
2. Able to effectively explain complex ideas in simple, intuitive ways

He uses a specific technique (now coined the ‘Feynman technique’) to learn new concepts. 

**Here’s how it works:**

1. Pick a concept to learn
2. Attempt to teach the concept to a sixth-grader
3. Identify your knowledge gaps
4. Organize and simplify, then tell the story

How to apply this:

**1) Pick a concept to learn**

Choose a concept you want to learn and write down everything you know about the topic. This is best done handwritten, on a sheet of paper.

**2) Attempt to teach the concept to a sixth-grader**

Use simple language. By only using words that a sixth-grader can understand, you empower yourself to understand the concept on a deeper level and simplify connections between abstract ideas.

Be concise. A sixth grader’s attention span requires you to be structured in your explanation and essentially, to deliver an elevator pitch.

You can further challenge yourself by including an example to ensure you put the concept into action.

&gt;“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”  
— (apparently) Albert Einstein

**3) Identify your knowledge gaps**

Identify where you struggled in the previous step — this is where gaps in your knowledge exist. Identifying gaps in your knowledge — areas you can’t speak confidently about, topics you forgot, or concepts you can’t connect — is the important part of the process. Filling these gaps is where the real knowledge growth happens.

Hit the books and study the literature to have a more complete understanding of the concept.

**4) Organize and simplify, then tell the story**

Amalgamate all your notes and sort them in a logical order. Build a narrative that you can effectively tell from start to end. Start to tell your story and practice reading it out loud. Pretend you’re teaching this concept to a room full of sixth graders.

If you run into a blocker or if the story gets confusing, go back to the previous step. Continue to iterate until you have a concise story.

By experimenting with this framework, you're practicing self-awareness in your knowledge areas. You'll be exposing your gaps and may realize that you know less than you previously thought. It'll take vulnerability for you to put your ego aside, but ultimately, this is part of the learning journey.

Sometimes it feels like I can’t even understand teachers when they’re talking. I don’t know if it’s just their lectures are very complicated or I’m just not processing the information well enough. It’s like they’re saying words and the words aren’t registering in my brain.


I’ve just been feeling very singled out in class because I’ve had classmates say “How can you not get it?” When information has been repeated to me. Or sometimes it feels like my teachers run out of patience because I can’t quite put things together. 


Everything feels like an elaborate puzzle that takes me FOREVER to solve. I feel embarrassed asking questions or clarification sometimes but I’m just trying to do my best. 


Sometimes it’s not even that I DONT get it, it’s just that I can’t explain how I get it.   Sometimes I can’t even put words together to ask a question when I’m seeking clarification. Words seem to absolutely escape me sometimes. I feel like I have a hard time forming sentences and speaking them, so everything that comes out of my mouth is jumbled. The only way I seem to be able to convey information to someone is by drawing diagrams, or drawing charts of how things connect or may work.


I spend a tremendous amount of time at home creating study guides, making mobile flash cards so that I can practice even during my breaks at work. I’ll get tutoring on campus, watch YouTube videos on the subject. And its paid off so far. I’ve been getting really awesome grades. I feel like I’ve truly learned a lot, and I’m understanding the material. It takes me a long time, but I understand it.


But I guess I just feel really inadequate compared my peers. I feel like maybe I just learn differently, but I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing.

33,dreamer0303,1614256186,/r/college/comments/ls5idn/to_the_professors_that_email_students_who_are/,"Admittedly, this semester has been rough. I’ll keep it short, but home life, work, mental health, weather, etc. I know others have it worse, but I get overwhelmed.

I’m falling behind in most of my 5 courses this semester. Still better than last semester though. I thought about taking a break but it’s my last year and loans and everything...I figured I’d just stick it out.

Anyway, my professor messaged me yesterday with the subject “Checking in”:

Dear ______,

How are you doing? I'm writing to check in with you. I haven't heard from you in this class yet and I'd like to connect with you to figure out how I can best support you. These are difficult times and I'm more than happy to be flexible with the course.

Let me know if you want to chat over video or phone, or just check in through email.

Best,

I honestly teared up. It’s a small class, probably around 10 people, so I’m not surprised he noticed. He already has a “no penalty for late work” policy his semester that I’ve definitely been taking advantage of. 

It was just so nice to receive. To be reached out to instead of having to reach out (which is really hard sometimes). Even motivated me to make more of an effort to get stuff done for his sake. I’ll try this weekend. I haven’t replied yet, but of course I’ll thank him and be honest.

Sorry, it’s 6am and I’m still awake and started thinking about how I’m going to respond. I really hope he doesn’t have Reddit omg, that’d be embarrassing sorry prof

Anyway, I've been a community college student since Fall 2017, and I'm an aerospace engineering major. I'm currently in my fourth year of what should be a two-year school, and it seems like I'm destined to get a fifth (god forbid not a sixth) year. I understand that my major with its intensive courseload just cannot be completed in two years plus gen ed, but my excuse for that ran out a long time ago. I never knew how to balance my classes (first person in my family to go to college) and ended up taking all my gen ed first. What ended up happening was that I ultimately ended up making it so that in the last two years I have never been able to take a ""full"" courseload. I've been stuck to taking two classes each semester due to scheduling, and the one time I managed to get three I got overloaded, had depressive episodes, and COVID happened. 

I consider myself a good student, I have a 3.89 GPA, am the president of my school's engineering club and do a bunch of work outside class TA'ing and tutoring to make money on the side. I work hard and generally succeed. However, over the past year I have had trouble in physics. It started when I took E\&amp;M; only one professor teaches it and his teaching style is very unique to say the least. To put it short, I cannot crack the code to succeeding in his class. I took E&amp;M with him during the aforementioned semester when COVID hit, and ended up dropping after doing mediocre on the first exam and failing the second one. All the effort I put into it went to nothing and it ended up dragging me down in my other classes - fortunately after dropping E&amp;M I was able to salvage an A in differential equations, and was one question on the final away from getting an A linear algebra but oh well. To make matters better, the next semester a new professor was teaching E\&amp;M; I retook the class and aced it without a problem, as I could better understand the new professor's teaching style.

That brings me to my problem now. That professor I struggle with, well he moved to teaching the class I'm taking now. I figured that my woes with his E&amp;M class came from my overloaded schedule, and since scheduling is an issue, I decided to take his class alongside a very easy materials science class. I figured I'd have all the time to study and succeed in his class. I studied hard for a couple weeks, understanding the concepts and I just failed the first exam. I simply cannot handle the style of his exams, and it is absolutely eating at me. I would at least like a B in the class, but I do not stand a chance in his exams, I've taken three of them and the highest I've been able to manage is a C; there are no curves and other students are somehow able to do what I merely cannot. 

I've dropped two classes before (is that a lot?), and I don't want this one class to define my academic career. Failing a class would void a transfer admission guarantee my college has with the UC system, and I would have to end up retaking the class anyway. Fortunately this professor won't be teaching the class next semester, but there's always a catch. First of all, if i were to drop the class I'd drop below the minimum unit threshold to be eligible to tutor at my school and I would have to pay back the $500 scholarship I earned for this semester. I'm willing to eat the money, but my grandparents whom I live with are beginning to get fed up with how long I'm taking to finish community college. My grandfather sees community college as a ""minor league"" for idiots and lacks understanding of how college works, but is insistent that he's right about everything despite him never attending higher education. The arguments I have with him whenever I have to drop classes/tack on another year to my timetable is traumatizing to say the least without going into anything too personal. I can understand why they are unhappy with me taking so long - I'm not happy with myself for it, but I'm only 4 classes away from graduating (including the two I'm taking this semester). 

I'm sorry if this is a tough situation to respond to, but I don't really have anyone to go to to talk about this. My grandparents are the only people in my family, and its always been my dream to attend a good school like Davis, UCSD, or UCLA (Davis is the school which my college has the admissions guarantee with, and it's the closest uni to me that offers aerospace degrees). I feel like I can easily pass the class with the next professor, who I took for mechanics. I will stick it out until the second midterm in April and see what happens, but if I fail that midterm, or barely pass, is it a better idea for me to take the ""W"" withdrawal grade and retake the class, take the financial penalty, and get scolded? Am I simply out of my league  and just let whatever happen happen? I've talked to the professor about this stuff before, and hes never told me anything helpful. I just cannot connect to his teaching style.",college,"Cannot pass the exams for a specific professor, considering withdrawal.

To be able to connect with like-minded people from all over the world and to experience life as a young adult. You should work hard, have solid friends, get internship opportunities, and think about your future and what you want to do in your career.

Why I am posting this? I did none of that. Depression stopped me from not making any connections in college. I made not a single friend in my 4.5 years in college. No connections didn't join clubs, nothing. All I got out of going to college was a piece of paper.

College isn't supposed to be about that piece of paper. It's about self-fulfillment, learning, growing and being a better version of yourself every single day. You should try new things, take the initiative, talk to new people, try new food, go to a party, and just be happy. I was none of that. Instead, I dreaded going to college and I despised it so much, but you know what is funny? I realize I miss college now. I screwed up. I missed the once in a lifetime opportunity where in those 4 years I could have done so much. I could have had the time of my life and instead I was severely depressed and hated every second of it. 

In hindsight, I think taking a gap year for me was something I should have done. If this is something that you think would benefit you then please do it. It's not the end of the world to take a year and getting to know yourself. What people never told you was that age doesn't matter. What matters is that you are happy and doing what you want. You need to find your own purpose and reasons to be motivated.

Also, don't take your college education for granted after all you are the one paying for it. Be proactive, be focused and be someone to be proud of. When you walk on stage the day you graduate, ask yourself are you proud of everything you have done. For me, I didn't even go to graduation. I never walked the stage; I never heard my name get called followed by the cheers and chants. 

My 4.5 years of college was the worse 4.5 years of my life. I feel so at odds with how everything turned out for me. What can I say? I did finish with a 3.0 GPA, but I let depression get the best of me. I made 0 memories to look back on. No fond moments at all. Just me and my dark times.

Lastly, if you are depressed then I urge you to PLEASE get help! Don't let it spiral out of control like what happened to me. Your life is so precious, you will be successful, and all those negative thoughts in your head is not true. I finally started to realize that. Now take my story for whatever it is worth and hopefully it helps someone. Remember that you will only ever be 18 or 21 for a single year. I'm 24, turning 25. Life isn't how I thought it would turn out, but I realize that is not important anymore. What is important is getting to know yourself. Finding the reasons to do what you are doing. Be the best version of yourself!

Good Luck! I really wish someone could have told me something like this when I started college. Maybe I would have snapped out of it, but no one was there for me. I'm there for you. I'm telling you my story! Be the best you can be! If anything, whatever you are going through you are not alone. Seek help and be at peace. I am starting to make peace with everything in my life.

36,ea0995,1612144565,/r/college/comments/l9rwmi/for_any_nondrinkers_in_college/,"Hi All,  
I graduated college a few years ago and I was a non-drinker in college. For anybody currently in college or about to start college and doesn't drink or isnt planning to. Here are some things I noticed while in school:

\-You will constantly be asked why you don't drink - people will ask you why you don't drink. Some may assume different things. Some assumptions I heard were: ""Are you waiting to turn 21?"", ""Was someone close to you an alcoholic?"", ""Did you have a bad drinking experience?"", etc. This will get tiring but it's important to try and not get angry about it.

\-There will be people who will take it as a challenge to get you to drink: let's face it, most people in college are there to drink and have a social life. They think the only way for everybody to have a good time is to have a bottle in hand and if you don't drink there will be some (not most) people who everytime you see them will try to give you a drink because to they have taken it as a goal to get you drunk. 

\-You and others may feel weird that you are the only one without a drink. At first I felt weird about it, especially when me and my friends would all be hanging out, they decided it was time to pop open a beer and get drunk. I learned to get used to it. There may be times where people will be drinking and just randomly ask you ""are you having a good time?"" like the fact that you aren't drinking is means you aren't having a good time.

\-Dreading having to explain to a new person that you don't drink: it's college so everybody will offer you a drink. Having to explain that you don't drink can be dreadful after doing it for what will feel like the 100th time.

\-It may be harder to connect/you may not be invited to hang out- people will assume you don't want to go out because they don't want you to feel weird about drinking. Or it could be people don't want you to tag along because you don't drink. Also there is a connection that happens when you can get shitfaced with someone, you won't have that connection so you will have to make an extra effort to connect with people. People will assume you are not fun because you aren't getting drunk and doing stupid shit.  

\-Playing drinking games- my friends always alternated the rules for me when it came to drinking games. But if I won, or was doing good then they'd say something like ""Of course he won, he's sober"". It wasn't a jab at me or anything and it was all in good fun, but just expect things like that to be said.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a non-drinker in college is tough. It will be hard to get the full college experience but it's important to find a group of people who don't mind it and want you to hang around even if you don't drink. It's also important to throw yourself out there, this could be hard if you don't have a drink.",college,For any non-drinkers in college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l9rwmi/for_any_nondrinkers_in_college/,1612162565.0

Everything is ridiculously complicated from setting up your account, to registration each year, and their organization and study materials are subpar at best. 

What triggered this final wave of anger you ask? After years of being in college, I had been forced to use McGraw’s Connect courses plenty of times. Now, I only have one Connect course (praise be the heavens) but I still have 5+ other, older courses clogging up my ‘To-Do’ and ‘Courses.’ Last semester I had multiple courses through Connect and it made it very difficult to use Connect as intended. It was a hinderance all semester, so knowing this now, I begin looking on how to delete old courses. “It is goddamn 2021,” I say to myself as I start the journey to finally weed out previous classes, “This shit should take 10 min to figure out and execute.”

Boys and girls....I was so wrong. After scouring the internet and attempting to use old hacks from years ago, I finally cave. I call customer service. I wait on hold, answer questions, confirm information, to finally be able to ask “Hey can you guys remove all courses but [the course I am taking]. Is that something u can help with?” Only to be told that Connect can only remove ‘expired courses’ AKA courses where your access has expired AND where your professor removes you from that course list. I do not know about ya’ll but the proffs at my college do not remove anyone from their online courses, they just add the new students each semester. And I do not know about ya’ll, but if I asked my proffs to do that they would literally go “Sure, no prob” and proceed to not do it or every think of it again in fact. 

This is the final straw. One of the MAIN functions of their Connect courses is the “To-Do” section. All I see on that page is “late assignments” from classes forever ago! And they weren’t even real assignments, just optional practice!! Why can I not remove myself from old courses? Is their a reason why not? A reason why the COMPANY ITSELF cannot remove the courses?? If there is a real reason that truly makes sense, I want to know. From where I am sitting, it does not have to be this hard lol. If your access expired to the class.....it should be shown on Connect as such and not be there.

It's just sad to see many students not enjoying just a little bit of the studying process, looking for days off/weekends to finally relax and enjoy their time. 

Is this all worth it, to not enjoy what you study, to get a job you don't really like but still doing it because you need financial support? Does this really sound appealing? It's ENDLESS. 

I hope after raising your awareness on this, the answer is no, we are all gonna die someday so why living life with choosing to suffer. Why not just studying in your own way and do your best to keep your curiosity and passion, so you don't look so much for days of and weekends.

Even during this online studies, it's still possible to give some efforts into keeping this process a little bit more interesting. I still hate some classes, I know it's very hard to keep yourself curious at everything you're studying, but having a bit of interest really makes things easier.

41,throwitaway100093,1603439965,/r/college/comments/jgiuut/recovering_after_final_suspension/,"Hey folks I’ll try to keep this brief but it’s been a hell of a roller coaster so I dunno how that’s going to turn out. When I graduated high school I went straight into a pretty good state school (I’m 28 now, for a time frame), but I struggled hard. Looking back, my HS didn’t really do a lot of college prep, it was more of just pass the standardized tests, and this district was very rural. 

Anyway, I struggled hard my freshman year, and ended up on first suspension after the first semester of my sophomore year. School was a challenge but I was also working two jobs, family issues, and dealing with a shebang of untreated depression. Tried a bunch of majors, shadowed professionals, nothing really fit. I went back and was suspended again a second time after my 4th semester. I realized I had other things to deal with, took six years, and then last fall tried to go at it once more. I had a lot more thing under control- finances were the big one but I was still working. The long and short of it was I felt I wasn’t getting the help I needed. My school over admitted that semester, and I really feel like my need for help went unheard: some classes where twice the size they normally were, and tutoring sessions were booked as soon as they opened for the week. I also struggled being in a rural community so focused on the university, but I was so much older than my classmates it was hard to connect.  I was put on final suspension at the end of that semester. 

I’ve taken a year to evaluate where I want to go and what I truly want to do, got my depression controlled with pharmaceutical therapy even though I don’t have insurance, and I’m currently enrolled in community college. I’m in an advanced associate’s program that does condensed classes that start every 8 weeks- we just finished our first 8 week semester and I got all As. I honestly feel like a changed man when it comes to school. I passed calculus with an A after failing pre calculus twice at my former university. I feel sharp, prepared, motivated, and dedicated. 

Now I guess my question is- does anyone have any advice for me moving forward? I’m not looking to go back to the university I was suspended from (my main problems being with the new administrative changes, plus the more rural setting than where I currently live didn’t help me last time). I’m looking at transferring to a four year college but I want to know if my past will hold me back? I’ve changed so much and worked so hard to get better I just don’t want all that to have been for so little payoff. Does anyone have experience with this situation, or any aspect of it? I just need to tell that little voice in my head obsessing about all this to quiet down.",college,Recovering after final suspension,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jgiuut/recovering_after_final_suspension/,1603457965.0

Undergrad English major here. Junior. 

This happens in academic writing and in everyday speech, especially in school. The feedback I’ve gotten from others is usually that it seems like I want to say too many things at once making it hard to follow, and also that I don’t follow through or fully finish my thoughts, in person and on paper. Indeed I usually do become exhausted frustrated and hopeless and often give up midway through. My professors are usually very enthusiastic about the thinking itself that’s happening in my written work but very frustrated by the fact that it’s unfinished, late and/or disorganized.

It sometimes takes me many multiple hours to write a single paragraph of an essay for university. And sometimes I’m simply rewriting the same thing but sometimes I’m not and the paragraph runs on and on and on and I never actually finish the intended point of the paragraph even three pages In. It’s like I feel it’s possible and necessary to expand on everything but the result is fragmented and layered. “A bit Overstuffed” was the only criticism one professor had for me on a paper I actually finished. 

I don’t know when to stop, and even if I do, it’s always too abrupt. It’s like there is a bridge to get from one side of the paragraph to the other that I need to build. And I keep adding plank after plank after plank to expand the bridge but for some reason I can never get to that last plank, the one that would connect one side to the other side. It’s like I can expand forever on something but I’m reluctant and unsure of how to conclude or finish anything. There’s always so much more to say. 

As for organization, I struggle a lot knowing where to put what and when to say what. The structure of my paper can be a bit odd, fluid or unclear. I do try to outline but I feel I must always abandon my outlines because they never work in practice. I feel a strong sense of everything being connected to everything else, like a literal knot I can visualize in my head, and the essential kerne of my argument is right at the center of that not, but the threads are so intricately and tightly interwoven that at some point each one becomes indistinguishable and the knot becomes an indivisible entity. It feels like one long paragraph or at least like everything if I do break it into paragraphs they are not clear or discreet entities, each one, but merely continuations of previous paragraphs. Where I begin and end seems arbitrary and I always feel acutely dissatisfied, as though I’ve only actually written 5 or 10 percent of what I meant to write. I run out of steam and give up.  

Let me be a little more concrete. Say I’m organizing a paper about Virginia Woolf and my first paragraph is about space, while the second is about time. Sounds simple enough but then the quotations most obviously about space are actually also about very much about time when you look closely enough! And not just that, but the very same thing that appears to be about space is also about time, not even different elements of the same quotation, but the very same words and phrases begin to mean many different things. And it’s not like it would make sense to analyze the quotation again later through a different lens because in this case, there is a very direct parallel (at least in my mind) between her conception of space and time. Also, in my mind, this expands to her conception of relationships and hierarchy and words and art. They all become related to a central paradox or conundrum, from which everything else arises and I start to see it everywhere. It is suffused throughout, in various ways. There are parallels and paradoxes everywhere but still there is often an underlying connecting thread that I sense very strongly and I always want to write about that, because that’s why all the other stuff matters, that’s what makes a paper worthwhile in my opinion, it gets to something essential. 

So then I decide to combine the paragraphs about space and time and instead organize in a different way. I sometimes try to base it around certain quotations so that I can talk about each in its complexity without having to jump back to it again but the problem with this is that there is no sense of growth because the first quotation is often just as rich as the last one. I lack a narrative progression because I don’t want to hold back in the beginning. Because like I said everything is connected to everything else and I can’t seem to untie the knot. I become overwhelmed, feel stupid, confused and lose steam. 

Often what I intended (in my outline) to be a single paragraph turns into the entire paper because once I start writing everything keeps expanding. And that’s after many hours of research/planning/outlining. It feels so difficult to condense what I want to say, and structure into paragraphs. I don’t think that it’s because I don’t spend enough time preparing, planning, and outlining because I spend a very long time doing this (and it’s my favorite part). I don’t begin writing until I have a complete idea of what I’m going to say, and evidence for it. 

Any idea what could help?

43,mountain-jumper,1597469550,/r/college/comments/ia1xzd/dorm_living_tips_from_a_former_ra/,"Hello, I lived on campus for 4 years as a resident and later as an RA; here is my advice for anyone who is planning on living on campus in the near future!  Disclaimer: what I am about to say is only my opinion, and my opinion is based on my experience at my institution; you'll have to find out what works for you, I just hope I can help point someone in the right direction!

* What is an RA?  RAs are undergraduate students (normally at least 2nd year) who are there to try and keep the dorms running smoothly.  At my institution, we ran the front desk during desk hours, went on rounds in the evening, and were generally on hand to help people out.  RAs are often compensated through housing, so if you are needing a place to stay and don't want to pay college town rents, consider applying.  Some disclaimers however: the job can kind of suck sometimes and a lot of people get burnt out, it may be less valuable in the long run than something like lab experience, and if can interfere with some financial aid due to being classified as a work/study position.
* What RAs can do: RAs generally can help you or connect you with someone who can help you for most campus issues.  Neighbors throwing a rager? Locked yourself out? Roommate conflict?  Trying to figure something out about class/campus?  All of these things are in an RA's wheelhouse.  
* What RAs can't do: RAs generally have very little power themselves.  Their boss (the RD in charge of the building) is often who will actually be doing the heavy lifting for a request.  Don't expect the RA to always solve a problem, but do go to them to find someone who can.
* RAs are not cops. At least at my institution, we cannot go in your room without permission outside of break room inspections (announced) or emergencies such as smelling smoke coming from a room.  You can refuse entry to us if we ask, and there is almost nothing that we can do about it.  We will not be serving search warrants, and the most will actually do is report an incident either to housing or to emergency services.  On the flip side, the housing disciplinary process is not a court room: you may be able to have an advocate, but you will not be judged by a jury of your peers and you don't need to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to get nailed for something.  Additionally, some legal statutes don't apply; for instance my institution, in an example of impeccable reasoning, decided to classify your body as a container when it came to drugs/alcohol so they could hold you in possession of them if you were drunk/high.  Was this BS that quite possibly pushed residents to stay in sketchy places rather than return to their bed? Probably.  Did housing care? nope.
* The best way to get yourself in trouble is to tell the RA yourself.  If you can reasonably deny that you're doing something against policy, deny deny deny.  If you are not visibly intoxicated you have not been drinking.  If the RA asks you to hand over/bring out your alcohol you don't have any.  If they say that they heard you talking about alcohol and that they smell it in the room inform them that you were only talking about it while you disinfected with isopropyl.  Yeah cooperation can get you some brownie points in conduct but depending on the RA there is a good chance that they won't even bother filing a report if there isn't any good evidence.  A lot of RAs are just concerned that you're safe so if you aren't doing anything disruptive/unsafe they will probably ignore the fact that they know you're drinking.  That being said being obstinate can bite you in the ass if there is enough evidence for housing (ie. the RA is knocking because they could hear the party from down the hall and you are refusing to open the door, they heard you say"" hide the alcohol"" and then a bunch of bottles clinking).  They best way to avoid issues is to avoid a confrontation in the first place: don't be loud enough for the RA to knock on your door, don't be intoxicated enough/in public to the point where the RA will stop you, and if you're coming back tipsy don't come back in a way that will make you cross paths with the RAs.  What the RA doesn't see, hear, or smell can't hurt you.
* Don't smoke in the dorm.  It smells about 3 times as strong as you think it does with the added risk of setting off the smoke alarm.  If you want to smoke do it off campus and give your clothes a chance to air out before you come back in.  This is doubly true for cannabis; just eat an edible and figure on staying in your room if you want to get high on campus.  Also, bloodshot eyes are a hell of a lot less suspicious than wearing your clout goggles at 11:00 at night.  
* Privacy: RAs have to follow a variety of privacy and reporting guidelines.  RAs don't tell your parents anything: we don't even confirm or deny that you're a resident.  This will not do much if you're on your parent's insurance and they get the bill from you being taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.  RAs aren't supposed to discuss any details about residents, particularly about conduct.  We all have stories, but even then we will  avoid any personal details.  RAs will ""report up"" regarding some serious incidents; sexual assaults, bias incidents, and similar things regarding student safety are required to be passed up.  RAs are not confidential, so if you are looking for a confidant ask your RA if there is anyone on campus such as a counselor who is confidential.
* You don't need to be friends with your roommate.  It can help, but so long as you respect and both commit to being courteous you can go an entire year as just some people who happen to live together.
* Talk with your roommate.  The number one thing that will cause problems is if you don't communicate; establish boundaries, set lights out times, agree to cleaning responsibilities, and let each other know when you are pissing each other off.
* If you are wanting someone to spend the night: ask your roommate if you can have the room.  You are not slick, your roommate is not asleep.  No matter how awkward it is to ask your roommate for the privacy, it will be less awkward than your roommate chucking water on you and your partner when you thought they were asleep.  Additionally: having sex and masturbating with your roommate in the room can be considered sexual misconduct as they did not consent.  Similarly, taking showers with your SO even in gender neutral bathrooms is frowned upon.
* If you are like me, falling asleep with a stranger in the same room can be hard.  Additionally, college dorms are often noisy especially if you aren't a night owl.  Buy some earplugs you can sleep in (I preferred disposable foam ones) and consider getting a sleep mask.  The downside is that you will have to work out a way to wake up on time but sleep is a lot more important than the stereotypes make it out to be.
* Textbooks are expensive as hell.  You can use the copies at the library and take advantage of other textbook lending libraries on campus.  Used books can be had at [thriftbooks.com](https://thriftbooks.com), local textbook swap groups, and other places; don't be put off by older editions, often they are only slightly rearranged and you can go off of the chapter headings if the page numbers don't match up.  Textbook rentals are fairly affordable if its just for a term, PDFs found online are even cheaper.  A class requiring a textbook doesn't guarantee you'll need it; save the receipt and return any books that you don't think you'll need or hold of buying them until you know if you need them.  
* Transportation is a must; walking everywhere limits what you can do and adds time to any trip you need to make.  Cars and parking are expensive but useful, especially if you can find free parking off campus either on a safe street or at a friends house.  Bikes are cheaper and are all but a necessity if you don't have a car; campuses are hotbeds for bike theft however, so get a sturdy U-lock, secure anything that can easily be striped off (bags, quick detach tires, etc), or better yet keep it in the dorm either in your room or in bike storage rooms if they are available.
* Dorm food is expensive and you will rapidly get tired of it, the best way to deal with this is to cook yourself.  I found breakfast to be the best meal to start with: oatmeal and eggs are easy to cook and cheap to buy.  For cooking I would recommend getting a saucepan, a frying pan, and a baking sheet along with any utensils, measuring implements, and food storage you think you need.  Additionally, a good cutting board is a must, as it will likely be the only trustworthy prep surface you will have at your disposal.  Dorms may lend out cooking supplies, but they are often of marginal quality, dubious cleanliness, and only available at certain times.  What appliances you are allowed to have will vary by institution and what lengths you will go to hide them, but I would recommend an electric kettle to anyone moving into a dorm: they are almost always permitted by housing, they allow for a lot of quick cheap meals (ramen, oatmeal, coffee, soup), and they don't require a large investment in money or in space.  Some personal favorite dorm meals I relied on were breakfast burritos, savory oatmeal, sandwiches, instant beans, home made bread, and quesadillas.  If you plan on cooking at all, get a mini fridge: dorm fridges are almost always overcrowded, unclean, and prone to theft.
* Lastly, moving out of the house to go to college carries a lot of freedom with it: what you choose to do with it is up to you and you should look to do what makes you happy.  Go to parties or not, set up your schedule how you want it to be whether that includes morning classes or evening ones, and surround yourself with people who you enjoy being around.  You get offered a lot of choices all at once in college, and the most important thing that you will learn is what works for you rather than what you do because you weren't given a choice.  Just try to stay safe, don't do anything too stupid, and think hard about your future and what you want to do with it!",college,Dorm living tips from a former RA,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ia1xzd/dorm_living_tips_from_a_former_ra/,1597487550.0

# How to Pick Courses

Let’s get this started! Before I talk about how I studied, I think it is best to start talking about how you go about picking a major and different courses. These choices can make or break your grade before you even study! To begin with, your goal should not be to pick bird courses, but rather, enroll in courses that are appealing and genuinely enjoyable (in your mind). This will lead to intrinsic motivation, that is, you will be motivated to study for the course material due to interest in the material rather than the grade. Trust me, it is so much easier to study, no matter how hard the course, when you are genuinely interested in the material being taught. For example, I was very interested in neurology and ended up enrolling in a neuroanatomy course. This course was very dense in material and was one of the hardest courses I took in undergrad, however, my interest in the material kept me motivated to study. Despite this, always consult ratemyprof (can be very inaccurate at times) and get feedback from upper year students regarding the instructors of certain courses. Don’t go picking courses blindly, folks. If the professor is a tough marker or even impossible marker, it doesn’t matter how smart or interested you are in a course, you are just tanking your GPA. So, pick courses that sound interesting and avoid any with bad feedback. This may be simple enough and you may do this, but it is good to reiterate, nonetheless.

# How I Studied for Science Courses

Alright so the course you enrolled in is perfect and the prof is fantastic! So how do you get the mark? For science courses, these are the steps that I took to get the A+

1. Before you even start studying, you need to remove any and all distractions
   - Stay on campus if your house is distracting, go to the library, go to Starbucks, just go wherever there are no friends or distractions. What if this isn’t possible (like now)? If you can’t go somewhere away from distractions, use noise-cancelling headphones, listen to 
                lofi, or listen to white noise so your mind doesn’t wander. I generally listened to rain sounds from “Rainy Mood” whenever this was the case.
   - I also put my phone on do not disturb mode. At the same time, I used an add-on for chrome ([StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en)) that blocked any browsing except for sites that I allowed. This allowed me to stop browsing on social media and losing focus while I was studying.

2. Next, I am someone who loses focus very frequently. To solve this, I eventually learned of the **pomodoro technique** to keep me on track and to allow me to study efficiently.
    - Steps of the technique from Wikipedia:
      - Decide on the task to be done.
      - Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
      - Work on the task.
      - End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
      - If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then 
             return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
      - After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark 
             count to zero, then go to step 1.
    - This technique allows you to take frequent breaks so you don’t burn out. I tried to eat something or chill during my break. Try not to look at social media during your break as it is difficult to stop browsing after 5 minutes. 
    - Lastly, please reward yourself after any productive studying as this leads to delayed gratification.

3.	Finally, let’s talk about how I actually studied in university. I am going to be completely honest; I did not even know that my studying technique had a name. I eventually learned that it was called Spaced Repetition. I think the easiest way to explain this concept is to talk about my average week during university. For the sake of simplicity, let’s say that you are enrolled in only 3 courses (biology, physiology, and anatomy) where you have a 1-hour lecture for each course every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. To begin with, after my lectures I would take a break and then go to my studying area and do the following: 
     -	**(A)** Memorize powerpoint slides the same day as the lecture. It is very important to study the information the day you were presented the material as it is much easier to memorize and learn. I did not really consult my notes on that day as I was more concerned with first making sure I had the facts memorized (more on this in the next section). For each 1-hour lecture, it will probably take you 30 minutes to 1 hour to study the information presented that day.
       -	A very important point that I have to make is that you MUST actively study at all times. Active studying means that you are testing yourself on the material that you were taught. For example, I would read a line of the powerpoint slide and try to repeat the 
               material by looking away. Other methods include using flash cards (through quizlet or apps like anki), summarizing the information in your own words, or answering problem questions. In my experience, reading &amp; highlighting is only useful for understanding broad 
               concepts, however, when it comes to minute details, reading will not help. For example, biochem is jam packed with lots of facts and small details. The only way to really do well is by memorizing and you would do this by actively studying.
     -	**(B)** On the following day, I would do a quick review of the slides and my notes without rememorizing. Here you are trying to apply your notes to the facts you memorized. That is, this is the day you are trying to understand the broader concepts being taught. At the 
                same time, look up anything you do not understand or ask your professor (this is the day to do this). While memorizing is great, you must connect the information to truly get the top marks. For example, ask yourself what would happen if a specific enzyme in the 
                Kreb’s cycle stopped working.
     -	**(C)** Repeat steps A and B for the next lecture of the week (i.e. the lectures on Wednesday).
             -	A small note here: on Thursday when you are repeating step B for Wednesday’s lectures, I would also repeat step B for Monday’s lectures as well.
     -	**(D)** Once you get to the end of the week, spend early Saturday morning to rememorize the week’s material. At the same time, pull out your notes and connect the week’s material to the broader concept that was trying to be taught. After this week, you will repeat 
                steps A-D for the next week of lectures, however, on Saturdays I would also lightly review all past lectures. By doing this, not only is the information much easier to study and memorize, it is much more efficient as well.
     -	**(E)** 3 days (or 1 week) before the midterm exam, start rememorizing all material up until the midterm. Go through at least 2 cycles of rememorizations (I always did 3), and then spend the remaining time connecting everything with your notes and consulting other 
                resources for things you do not understand. If you have been following the spaced repetition from the very beginning, rememorizations should literally take a few hours MAX. You no longer have to go crazy and cram for 24 hours or 48 hours straight with no 
                breaks. This allows you to be stress free and happier overall.
     -  **(F)** Lastly, for final exams, I would start the same process as step E but this time 2 weeks before your exam date. Once again, spend a few days rememorizing then spend the remaining time going over concepts you do not understand while connecting notes to what 
                you memorized.
     - *A quick note on textbook readings. If you are not being directly tested from textbook (always ask your professor) then do not waste time reading or buying the textbook, powerpoint slides should suffice. However, if you are having trouble understanding certain 
                  concepts, then by all means read the textbooks. However, if your prof is also testing from the textbook, I would do all the steps I mentioned, but spend the weekend to quickly take notes from the textbook. I would then only start memorizing textbook material 1 
                  week before the midterm (as there was less weight put on this material)*

# Writing Courses

Alongside my major, I also had to pass some general education courses that were mostly writing. Here is my approach on how to get good grades in any writing course:

For writing courses, I did not memorize. If there were assigned readings, I would do them over the weekend and take notes. My notes acted as a summary of the material. During lecture, I would then take notes from the lecture and try to apply the different themes taught to the summary of the reading.

In terms of writing, the key to any essay is the thesis. A thesis needs to make an argument. It needs to be a controversial topic where both sides can reasonably defend their point of view. If your thesis is not controversial, then the paper you are writing is not arguing for anything, it is just restating facts. For essays always start couple of weeks before and write down a bunch of potential thesis ideas. Show these to your TA and professor and revise as needed. Once you have the go-ahead, write a proper outline slowly and keep editing the outline. Afterwards, start writing your essay. Do not try to write an essay 2 days before it is due, it just doesn’t work out.

Very importantly, you might think what you’ve written is good but these courses are very different and its best to follow your instructor’s feedback. Do not go against their word or else you will get a bad mark. Just because you think you have a good argument doesn’t mean the TA or prof will give you a good mark. It is all about what they think so always use their office hours and write what they think is best, not what you think is best. These courses are subjective so it is best to approach them this way.

# Math/Physics/Chemistry:

Generally, the prof makes or breaks these courses. These courses rely heavily on understanding abstract concepts so if not taught properly, it is difficult to do well. If you find that the instructors are difficult to understand, look at the possibility of taking the course in the summer in a different university (if you are really worried). If that is not an option then khan academy, organic chemistry tutor, and others on Youtube have proven to be great resources. Additionally, go to tutoring sessions on campus (if available) and visit the professor during office hours to make sure you are understanding concepts correctly.

Instead of memorizing like before, you want to read over the concepts and spend time after the lecture to do the assigned homework problems.

If you can’t solve a problem, spend as much time as you need and NEVER LOOK AT THE ANSWER! If you cannot solve without looking at the answer, you are not ready for any testing scenario. Do not look at the answers even if it takes you the whole day. Go over your notes and try to see what concepts are being examined by the problem and see if you’re missing something.

Mark any problems you had trouble solving so you can redo them later during the weekend to see if you understood the concepts being taught.

Really, with these courses, you are just grinding textbook problems. The “spaced repetition” for these courses is just making sure you are doing the problems for the sections as they are taught. The week before the exam, redo the problems assigned and try to complete sample practice tests.

Hopefully you will all be able to get the A+ in any course and I hope you learned something new! All the best everyone and good luck on your college journey!


TL;DR – Go to step #2",college,How I went from being a clueless freshman to graduating with a 4.0 GPA,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hzpbw4/how_i_went_from_being_a_clueless_freshman_to/,1595996017.0
45,floridalass,1592203893,/r/college/comments/h9avgf/i_was_raised_in_a_semi_cultand_now_im_at_a_loss/,"This might be a long one but I need help so I am turning to Reddit for the first time in my life, lol. 

I was raised in a semi cult that taught that women shouldn’t go to college. Or have careers. Or jobs. Or wear pants. This is a major reason why I am a freshman at 23. Also, bad health and that jazz. 

Anyway, I took it upon myself that, come hell or high water, I was going to make something of myself and go to college and get my music degree, because music is the one thing that I am very good at. (We did escape the semi cult a few years ago, yay.) I trained privately in violin, cello, and voice for years. I’ve been singing opera for about 3 years and I really do love it. 

Thus far, I’ve just been knocking out Gen Eds online. I am transferring to an on campus university this fall. I am very proud that I got in because I worked so hard for it. I came to the college world woefully unprepared because I was taught that my sole purpose in life was to get married and have lots of children, so why bother preparing for college? I didn’t even take the SAT. But I worked my butt off and have been accepted into a fantastic university and I am excited and I’m registered for music classes....

But, I don’t know that I want to study music performance (voice) anymore. The career choices are a.) professional opera singer or b.) music teacher. 

I am a darn good opera singer. My voice teacher is faculty in one of the best vocal programs in my state. 

I genuinely do not want to travel the world living by myself in musty old hotel rooms making pittance as an opera singer. I HATE auditioning. I suck at music theory and I’ve never bothered or had the motivation to get better at it. I fake my way through difficult music because I have a great ear and I can memorize music after hearing it a couple of times. 

Also, I would rather die than be a music teacher. 

I guess I just can’t imagine why I’m about to spend the next 4 years of my life accumulating student loans for a degree that I feel I will regret. But I am terrified to do something else because it feels like I can hide behind music because I can always fake my way through it and be the best one in the class. That’s how it’s always been. I’m scared to do something else and be bad at it. But I feel like I am making a mistake by majoring in voice performance. I love music, but I don’t want to do it as a career. Performing gives me debilitating anxiety and I can’t see myself getting over it. I don’t want to live my life constantly stressed because of performing. And then the other option is teaching and I just...can’t.

So, on to my other considerations. I’ve always been obsessed with the idea of radio and broadcasting. I also love to write. I’m a fantastic, dynamic, convincing writer (it’s 3 am and I’m emotional right now so don’t judge my writing skills by this, lol). I’ve been paid to write before. I’m also extremely expressive, I love to talk and use my voice and I connect with people very easily. I guess that’s why the broadcasting thing is attractive to me. The school I attend also does broadcasting internships. I just love the idea. I don’t know a lot about it but I’m doing some research. It feels more practical? Like there could be a wider array of career options. 

I don’t even know what career field I want to go into. I mean, I’m 23 (24 in a month) and I’m lost. I am LOST. I’ll be 28 when I graduate college and I’m discouraged because it almost feels pointless to even begin at this point. I am so conflicted and confused and have no idea where my life goes from here. I thought I had it all figured out when I decided to major in music and it sort of breaks my heart to know that deep down I am realizing that’s not the path for me. 

I want something more practical I suppose. Something that I enjoy and that I can depend on that doesn’t involve being a teacher as the only other option. Voice performance leaves you with like, zero options. It’s a useless degree unless you’re wholly committed to music as your career and I just don’t think I am. I love music. It’s so dear to me. But you’ve got to have a deep commitment to it to be dedicated enough to do what professional opera singers do.

I guess that’s it. Do I give voice performance a chance? I know I’ll enjoy it in the moment. But what about 4 years from now with a useless degree and a ton of debt? So many music students I know have suffered the worst burn out and say that music school stripped away their love of music. Music is just a deep, soul thing for me. It’s not something I want to crank out for money.

Or should I talk to an advisor about switching my major? 

Everyone I know expects me to go into music. Because everyone I know has heard me sing. They all know that’s my “thing.” They all love it. My voice teacher would be devastated if I left the music program. But I absolutely hate having the weight of everyone’s expectations of me. I want to do what I want to do. I want to do something different. I truly believe I’m capable of something other than music. Music is just the only thing I was ever allowed to be good at. I am an intelligent, dynamic person. I have a 4.0 GPA. I’m very adaptable. I’m well spoken. I’ve always been praised for these qualities. I just want to break out of this stupid shell that has me pegged as a singer and a musician when I am so freaking burnt out from music! I do not want to spend the 4 years of my life doing music!! I don’t want to make a career of music!! 

Help me out, Reddit. I could use some objective advice. I’m panicking, I’m lost, I’m confused, I’m discouraged. I’m scared. I want to be my own person. I know this is a jumbled mess and if it weren’t 3 am I would probably edit it. But I’m not going to.

I graduated with my BA this semester. While I am glad I was able to finish and do fairly well, part of me is sad looking at my time in school because I didn't really make any real friends that lasted for longer than a semester. 

I tried to join some clubs at my school, but never went to more than a few meetings because I just felt disinterested and/or awkward going by myself. I had roommates though most of the time we barely talked and the few conversations we had were pretty superficial. I also have never been in a real romantic relationship, or even kissed anyone. I guess it's because I'm pretty introverted with some slight social anxiety, and I find it hard to connect with others.

I literally hate my career. I hate everything about it but I feel like my parents, and with how mentally unstable my mother is, just either want me to finish or they have already decided ""I should be a failure in life"", which scares me too much. So, from their opinion, and I guess without choice mine too, I just have to study for the sake of studying, because everything ""with a lot of hard work"" can achieve anything. The motivation is simply not there. I feel like I could be good at something else, and I am, because friends and family members won't stop reminding me of how smart I am, or how good I am at this or that.

But I just don't believe that anymore. I feel like an idiot, because every time I have an essay or an exam, despite all of my efforts for the contrary I literally can't put myself to work, not the way I would want to. It's physically difficult for me, I'm not joking. Sometimes I get it, and I somehow study.

50,grahamalondis,1588102582,/r/college/comments/g9twm9/im_graduating_with_a_bachelors_and_a_40_in_two/,"So I'll start off by saying that a 4.0 goal GPA isn't going to be worth it to you unless you want to go to a top-20 law school or graduate program (in which cases you can still get in with 3.8 and lower). Law school has been my goal, and now that I'm in the thick of prep I do not regret any of it at all. Law schools count A+s toward GPA, so my law school apps will list my GPA as 4.07: this is well above even the 75th percentile GPA for admitted students at Harvard, Yale and Stanford; in other words, because I worked so hard, all I need is a great LSAT score and I can go to the best law schools with major scholarships, perhaps even some full-rides at some schools. Sometimes it pays! But again, don't shoot for a 4.0 unless you have the highest goals. 


That said, don't blow off your GPA either. I've gotten really good scholarship money and named awards such as a faculty endowed scholarship that's really nice to have on a resume (I was the one person at my CC to receive the award). But you have to apply—most people don't make the effort and miss out big time.


There was also one instance when DegreeWorks was not displaying my classes correctly and my advisor was telling me I needed more classes than I had thought. I insisted something was wrong and she figured it out manually. She said for most students she would have probably blown off those claims, but because my grades were perfect she knew I wasn't pulling stuff out of thin air. You really never know in what ways it might help you.



Okay! Enough with that. Onto the general stuff.



Community college

Start at CC if your parents aren't paying your way. Some are better than others, but most CCs are the exact same education. A lot of my CC profs also worked at the university I transferred to. Don't get hung up on ""the college experience."" It's not completely bullshit but it's mostly bullshit. It's what convinces you to live on campus for 4 years and pay 4 years of tuition. The savings are significant and will shorten/lower your student loan payments. If you're at college/going to college to socialize, you're in the wrong place. There's plenty of ways to make friends without spends tens of thousands in extra money.


Quick note on loans: many students don't understand that unsubsidized loans start accruing interest immediately. Borrow carefully.


Be Aware of Benefits

Make sure that if you have a parent who is a veteran that you have fully explored benefits. I'm in Texas and part of a big family. Our first two college grads didn't know that Hazelwood could exempt their tuition. So only one sister and I have used the exemption. We both paid CC out of pocket so between the two of us we didn't even used all the exempted hours in the benefit. My little brother is at CC now and will use the rest of the credits when he transfers. Between the 3 of us we will have collectively spent around 15K for 3 associate's and bachelor's degrees. That's before you count the scholarships and grants. Because my family is not wealthy (good grant $), and because of my dad's military benefits, and because of my scholarships, I've actually been PAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. This isn't going to be the situation for most people—my point is that you shouldn't be like my two older siblings who didn't know what they were entitled to. 




Gen Ed's/Core Curriculum

These are generally hated and blown off. I get it, you think you know all this stuff already. The truth is that you don't. Being smart isn't knowing everything, it's knowing when you don't know something and then doing what you can to learn more. What I think really helped me was how open I was to all the gen eds. I would always find a way to connect the content of each class (1) to my life and (2) to all the classes I'm taking and often those I've taken before. Not only does this help you make sense of the world but it also helps you remember the content of each class—this will help you in life and help you ace future courses as you build your knowledge. Doing this helps your brain form connections, and knowledge that has multiple connections is easiest to access. In short, view gen eds as opportunities. There's always something you don't know or a connection you haven't made.


Majors and Careers

You'll hear a lot that you don't need to know everything before you start, and that's true. That first year is a time to explore your options. I went in as a Psych major and came out an English major who now loves books and writing. However, the rubber meets the road your second year. You don't have to know your exact job yet, but you need to settle on a major ASAP to avoid taking fall through classes, paying extra money for school, and delaying your graduation. It's not a good time. And to that end, you should figure out your exact career as a senior and shape class projects around your career specialties. For example this semester I've been doing a legal-based project.


Study Abroad

If you are remotely interested in study abroad, do it in your first year and a half. You won't have too much of your degree plan filled in, which allows you to fill gen eds abroad or take on some electives. I did study abroad my last semester of CC. I had to take one fall through class to get to go because my plan was too full. They're also different lengths—mine was only 2 weeks abroad. I had a scholarship pay most of the costs and my CC had a program that gave people free summer tuition for being full time the previous two semesters. I paid almost nothing to go because I used that faculty endowed scholarship to cover almost all the ~$1000 leftover to pay. Look into it! There's a lot of scholarship money available for it and especially at CC it isn't costly at all.



Studying

I don't think I'm smarter than my average classmates. I just wanted it enough to genuinely make an effort for every assignment. This means *doing the reading*.Make a schedule that works for you. You might have to sacrifice some things here and there, but that's a cost/benefit calculation for you to make. Just give everything a real effort and make the connections I already talked about. For really tough classes, I'd always read the optional texts and sometimes seek out extra books to help me understand (Spanish was a real bitch). I personally found group study distracting and unproductive for me, but do what helps you.



Classes Everyone Should Take

1. Technical Writing/Business Writing: no matter your major, this class teaches important skills such as cover letters, *good* resumes, business reports, and other types of documents you WILL need to write effectively. I honestly think this class should be listed as a gen ed.



2. Business Applications/MS Office
A lot of people know this stuff. But this is your chance to learn more about MS Excel/spreadsheets. Basically everything job these days requires spreadsheet knowledge.


Non-liberal arts majors: take some kind of writing-intensive course. Everyone needs to write better. Most people do not write well at all. This is especially important if your major doesn't usually allow for professor interaction. Professors who read your writing typically get to know you better than a professor who doesn't. These classes are great networking opportunities to build relationships with professors who can write great letters of recommendation for you and might even reach out to you with jobs (they both know you and are highly skilled writers). If you can't bring yourself to take one, show up to office hours whether you need help or not. I've had multiple professors come to me with job opportunities, and I'm close to enough of them that I'm having a hard time choosing which ones to write my LORs for law school. They're major resources for you. Don't waste it! I had a personal rule of *at minimum* making sure every single Prof knew me by name.



Make Friends

I made a lot of friends in my classes, but I wish I'd made even more. They can help you get through this experience in one piece and remain friends long after (I still talk to friends who graduated before me). Make friends in your major classes especially because you need to start making professional connections right away. Clubs and other volunteering options are also good for this: I wish I were able to do these things more, but between school and working to live I just didn't have the time to do very often.



Working

Everyone's situation is different, but I ended up with a really flexible driving job for an incredible company. It paid great for the type of work and didn't drain my mental energy. I'd also often use podcasts and audio books to make up for missed study time. It's definitely beneficial to work in your career field, but often these positions are mentally draining and do not pay well and are not flexible.



Internships

Work at least one of these before you graduate. Unpaid work sucks, but when the hiring choice is you with no internship vs. another student with an internship, that other student is getting the job 9/10 times



Research and Publishing

Try to undertake at least one MAJOR project. It doesn't have to be a thesis, but make something at some point that is significant work that you can add to your portfolio. You can also submit this work or other work to journals. Being published is huge to have on a resume, especially for grad school or professional school. I researched and wrote this huge project about my school, but its contents were way too sensitive to publish anywhere. Oh well. You can also submit your work to your school's or a nearby school's research conference. I ended up winning 1st place prize for work that I submitted on a whim.



That's about all I can think of right now. Feel free to ask questions if there's something I didn't cover.


All in all, college has been a truly life changing experience, and my confidence has gone from the lowest lows to the highest highs. Enjoy the experience, socialize (if you want to) make friends, and have fun. Just don't forget that you're there to learn and to advance your career.



PS I'll add that liberal arts gets a lot of hate, but it's mostly founded on job outcomes. There's so much that I've learned in these courses and so much that I've read that has totally changed the way I look at the world and life in general. Keep in mind that there's plenty of stuff worth learning even if it isn't relevant to your career.

I'll also recognize that not all of this will be helpful to everyone. I've been incredibly fortunate these 4 years.

52,a_tulsa_wet_diaper,1584814018,/r/college/comments/fmj825/advice_from_a_senior_5_things_ive_learned_from/,"1. Get Involved-Unfortunately for me I didn’t get super heavily involved until junior and senior year because of very strong anxiety and depression. But my advice, no matter how shy you are, at least go to the club/intramural/volunteer once to see how you like it. Even if you don’t talk to anyone, people will know your face and eventually a more outgoing person will try to connect with you.


2. Relationships are everything-This is what I’ve learned most about life from college. Especially for business majors, you will benefit the most all around if you make friends with everyone you come in contact with. Friends in the dorms, classes, teachers, faculty.  This will not only make you feel better, but you will have so much more help with having fun on campus, homework, finding internships, and eventually getting hired. 


3. Daily Rules- Pick how much you are willing to study and then shape your life around that. For me, I hated doing work past 9pm, so I would stop work then and then rest until about 10:30pm when I would go to sleep.  This would make me procrastinate less during the daytime because I was working towards that relaxing time at the end of the day.  Additionally, you need to have a SOLID SLEEP SCHEDULE.  Even if you don’t get all your studying done every night 8+ hours of sleep will allow you to keep working the next day.


4. Have several outlets-Do something routinely that has nothing to do with school. Some of mine were, no schoolwork on Fridays, go to the gym 3 times a week, and go to my intramurals/clubs on their schedule days of the week. Even if you have a super challenging major, strategically you will do better when you allow your brain to organize itself and to prevent burnout.


5. Study Smarter- Since I’m a slow reader, reading textbooks and novels would be such a time sink for me. Therefore, I would only spend that much time doing it only if it was absolutely necessary. Many teachers tell you to do the reading, but their tests and quizzes are 90-100% based off the notes in class. So I would read the books until the first quiz, and then if it’s not based of the reading I would no longer read for that class. This gave me more time to do real studying for my harder classes, and not waste valuable study time on nonsense. 


Honorable Mentions:

Study Over Time- I know this is hard, but if you can look over your class notes briefly after class and maybe even make flash cards or whatever for them, it will be much easier when you relooking over everything the week before the test. 

Hygiene-Look good, smell good, feel good.  For me, I liked doing my laundry on my off day so that it doesn’t interfere with my school work. But some people liked doing it as a study break either way. On the other hand, (controversy warning) I’m not the type of person to look down on someone for wearing a shirt two times in a row because they needed to study for a test instead of do laundry/shower, just try not to get super gross if you can. 

Friend Groups- imo, friend groups are nice to be apart of, but don’t make them your only social contact. I did this my freshman year and got burned because my two best friends both dropped out and that kinda left me stranded. My advice is that if you’re in a group, be nice to them and always try to hang out, but kind of have your own secret side mission were you are looking for other opportunities to meet new people (clubs/sports).

Before we could do the interview we had to take a leadership course for one month and then we could sign up and do the interview. There was one residents hall coordinator (let’s call her Sally) and 2 RAs leading the course.  
The university had many class times and my class ended with 6 people. The course consisted of many homework assignments and conversations about self awareness, diversity, difficult conversations etc. Sally really wanted us to talk about our emotional traumas and tried to make everything really deep and personal the entire course. I’m introverted and I actively participated in every class even though I didn’t share too much personal information about me. Sally also called me out whenever I didn’t share the “deep” stuff. But when other people barley talked that day she said nothing. The class ended a couple weeks ago and I have the interview in 1.5 weeks. Sally sent me a post course update saying she wouldn’t recommend me for the job because I’m too introverted and I “never” seemed interested in the course. She also said I did not have the “capability” to handle social situations. Then she proceeded to say “good luck on interview day”. I don’t care if she wouldn’t recommend me because that’s her opinion but it made me really upset when she TOLD ME because I don’t think that creates an even playing field. And I have to go into the interview already knowing there’s a strike against me. But also I can work around with what she said because it’s not like she said I was violent or I had behavioral issues. I whole heartedly believe that being introverted and being on the quieter side is a great quality to have. It means that I’m a much better listener and observer of people. I’m more attuned with emotional cues and sensory details. It makes me more approachable and it will be easier to connect with introverted residents like me. Yes I’m introverted and I always will be but I love to challenge myself and I’ve made it a goal the past 3 years to step out of my comfort zone at least once a day and I’ve been very successful. I set little goals like talk to a strange today or raise my hand in class. I’ve set big goals for myself like this summer I lead a bunch of freshmen around for a week and they all gave me really positive feedback. I showed up to the class on time everyday, I did all of the homework and I participated every class period even If never shared overly personal information about myself. Those are not the signs of someone who is “disinterested” and this is the perfect example of how extroverted people don’t pick up on little things like that. I have 2 other references that said positive things about me but because Sally is an RHC I’m terrified her reference will hurt my chances of getting the position. I feel like she thinks that only extroverts can be leaders. But there are a many different types of leadership styles and I might do something differently than an extroverted person but that doesn’t mean it’s the wrong way. Its also beneficial to have a staff full of different leadership styles so that way they can learn from each other. There’s about 180 candidates and most of them probably all got great recommendations. They said that inclusivity is important and they want diverse students to represent (I’m Asian) and I have an uncommon major. Can that help my chances? I want your honest opinion do you think I have a chance of getting the job? How do you think my RHC reference will effect the interview? Because once someone reads something about you it’s out there and it’s hard to get it out of their heads and change their mind about you",college,RA INTERVIEW HELP?!?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ff7dzw/ra_interview_help/,1583659348.0
54,whatstea,1580157244,/r/college/comments/eutxh9/how_to_get_over_club_anxiety/,"Hi guys,

I'm a sophomore in college. I have a really good group of friends but I decided to join a club because I feel like I should always be trying to network and meet new people. I joined this club, but I really don't like it because I joined it alone and I don't know anybody. This is the part where you say: ""Big deal, that's the whole point of clubs, right? To meet new people."" Well, it isn't that easy. First of all, everyone in this club already knows each other. If they don't, they are joining with their friends so they already have a group and aren't trying to meet new people. Second, it's a huge club and is extremely overwhelming to get to know people. Third, a lot of the new members are freshmen and I know people of different classes can be friends, obviously, but when I already don't have a lot in common with the people in this club, that's just another thing that makes us different and makes it harder to connect. This leads me to my next point:  Fourth, the personality of the club (very sorority-like, overly positive and cheerful, basic white bitch, starbucks, vsco girl etc.) does NOT match my own, and I already feel like I'm going to be an outcast. I always feel like one of the ""weird kids,"" and this isn't helped by the fact that in my early high school years, I joined clubs and I never felt like I fit in or had friends until my junior and senior year. I joined this club not really knowing what it was about and not wanting to judge it before giving it a try, but I'm finding it so hard to not be discouraged, especially when ON THE FIRST DAY, one of the leaders of the group who I sort of know singled me out for being a new member and not knowing anyone, which made me feel 10x worse and embarrassed me. Right now, I feel like how I did my freshman year of high school--alone, uncomfortable, anxious, and I hate it. It doesn't help that I'm generally a quiet, shy person (still don't know why, because both of my parents are outgoing and good at talking to people).

Along with using Microsoft Office, I will be starting a YouTube channel so I will be doing some light video editing (I have my desktop for heavy video editing) but I want to be able to do some light editing on the go. 

I have seen some amazing deals on Amazon for renewed and even new Surface Pro 6 laptops, and I like that I can use my typecover from my Surface Pro 3 on it without having to spend extra. So thay would be the reason I would consider a Surface 6. 

Surface Pro 7 - I'm not sure, the only thing that is exciting over the 6 is the USB-C charging. New gen Intel chips are nice but coming from a 3, the 6 will be a huge upgrade as well. Does either the 6 or 7 come with a graphics chip? 

The Surface Laptop 3 is the one I'm leaning towards. It's a bit over my budget so I'll have to dip into savings and only get the lowest configuration (128 GB, I5, 8GB ram) 

One thing that annoyed me about my Surface Pro 3 was I bought a USB divider so I can connect multiple hard drives and my wireless mouse. When I would connect the Mouse USB. my external harddrives (I have 2) it would NOT work with the 3. I was looking at a generic Amazon Surface dock for any of the devices I choose.

What I noticed is that it’s been pretty much impossible to make friends through my classes (I’ve met most of them through extracurriculars and other events). Lectures are particularly hard because they are so big and everyone just sits down and learns and then leaves. Same with smaller labs/discussion classes, people usually just sit on their phones until it begins and leave right after. 

Yesterday I had a smaller class and the classroom was arranged with square tables with four chairs at each. This isn’t a usual set up as for my discussion/lab classes as it’s usually individual desks or really long desks that go all the way across the room. 

Walking into the class everyone was silent and on their phones like how most classes are, but because of the set up me and the two other people at my table eventually started speaking. So did everyone at the other tables around the class. By the end of class I had a great conversation with the two people sitting with me and I’m glad to know I can go back next week and see friendly faces. Having people I like in my class makes the course so much more interesting and makes me more excited to learn in that setting.

57,adeleismeta,1577925688,/r/college/comments/eiqjck/is_it_wrong_to_ask_for_a_recommendation_when_im/,"So I will try to keep this brief but I need advice. This past semester I took the intro class for what I now decided is going to be my major. I had chosen something similar before but after this class I realized it was more specific to what I want to study. My professor is awesome, but I dealt with a few things this semester that made me a less than awesome student. I was super depressed after a passing close to me, and I was dealing with some health issues for a moment (and I don't have healthcare so I was also working insane hours to be able to pay for things). Anyway, towards the end of the semester I started slacking and I missed a quiz work 5% of my grade. No big, I thought, since I was on track to an A+ anyway. Life then hit me really hard and I didn't go to class for like 2 weeks (missed 4 classes). I was behind on assignments but my professor (thankfully) reached out to me to see what was up. I explained to her what was going on and she told me to just turn my paper in (I am a perfectionist and wrote a paper I didn't think was good enough so I just, didn't submit it). I submitted it and she gave me an extension on the 3rd paper since it depended on the feedback of the 2nd. Throughout all of this, I made sure to attend office hours when I needed help, and I got to know her better a bit. The last time I attended office hours was to clarify revisions for my 2nd paper, and we talked about school and she suggested I take 2 of her classes this upcoming semester (I signed up for them immediately because they are within the realm of what my concentration is). 

So here is my dilemma. I managed to get in the 3rd paper on time with the extension, and all other assignments when they were do. I feel bad because I should've reached out to her about what was going on instead of the other way around. She enjoys my writing and I enjoy her style of teaching and I feel like she is someone I could connect well/seek advice from with later when I'm getting really into my major. I am currently applying to a summer study abroad program and it has to do with my major and specifically areas her classes next semester will touch on, and it is an opportunity I do not want to miss out on by not applying at the very least. I should also mention she passed me with an A- when I probably deserved a B-. Anyway, I want to ask her for the recommendation because she knows me and my work well, and she also understands why I would want an opportunity to study this particular thing. I feel like after the shit I put her through with her basically holding my hand was enough and that asking for a rec at this point would just be pushing my luck possibly. I can't tell if I'm in my head about it. Another thing I'm considering is waiting until the 1st week of classes (Jan 13th) and asking her in person ??? but I feel like that may be too much pressure. It would give her a little under a month to write it as well so I need to decide quickly.

I feel super burned out from work, and I'm not really involved in much here. The clubs that I thought would interest me didn't, so I have no motivation to participate in any of them and I find it difficult to join new clubs this late into the semester.

More broadly, I feel like I don't even know what interests me anymore. I don't really have hobbies, I don't really know if I still wanna pursue the major I thought I would, and I'm not as interested in the stuff that used to interest me like watching movies or reading. I feel like all this makes it hard for me to connect with other people over shared interests, which sort of leads into my next problem:

I feel like I have friends but I'm not really close to any of them. Everyone around me seems to have formed friendships while I'm sort of on the outside of it all: I'm friendly with people but they are closer with other people, and they hangout/make plans without me. I'll admit, a part of may just be that I didn't really reach out enough or be as social as I could have been. But still, this really concerns me since I felt the same way in high school and was hoping that college would be different. But it's just more of the same, and I'm worried that at the end of four years I'm just gonna be feel let down by college like I did high school.

I really just want a break from school, where I can hopefully figure out what interests me, become better at reaching out to others, and honestly just recharge. Problem is, I'm not sure what I can do during my leave of absence that will accomplish all of this. Does anyone who's taken a leave/knows someone who has have any suggestions?

(This post it will be a long one).

I'm  now in the second year and I was thinking about what to do in the third  year; It's about a transfer from mechanical engineering to  mechatronics. Why? Because I have more friends (guys and girls) there,  they are very serious and serious about studying, they help each other, I  can chat easily with them, they send in their whatsapp group useful  things, etc.; In my mechanical group, most of the people are not that  serious and they don't care about studying; when somebody asks, they  barely respond and it's more like 3 people chatting most of the time and  the rest is watching or afk; Don't get me wrong, I love to joke, I like  funny stuff, but it shouldn't be like 99% of the time, especially when  it's something very serious. In my first year, I was the only girl in  the group, same now in the second (At the beginning it bothered me a  little but I got used to it and I met in this group 4 nice guys, but the  rest of the guys were pretty rude). It's a little hard to chat with  these guys, in some way I feel excluded, even when I speak it's not that  important, a guy in the mechanisms class threw a thing in my face,  maybe he wanted to throw at one of his friends because I was sitting  next to him, but he could say a damn sorry.

I  really want to study at mechanical engineering (I want to design,  mostly mechanical design), I'm not so into mechatronics (they're similiar in some way, in these 2 years we did the same subjects, same teachers) but this thing bothers me. Ok, maybe you will say : "" then try  to stay with those 4 nice guys all the time"", I can't do that all the  time, they can't do either, and I just wished the whole group was atleast a little nice and serious so we can do projects togheter, help each other.

Someone  told me to not transfer because all we do the same thing, same subjects  almost. ""When you graduate, you will be the same engineer like the  other one, you will have the same basics as him or her, not a big deal.""

So,  should I choose this profile because there are better people out there  but I'm not so into it (maybe I will enjoy it, maybe not) or staying  here but I know that I will be alone most of the time and it would be  hard to get help for doing projects and other stuff. I know how bad is  to connect with some people, I like to work alone too but I also like to  work in group.

61,BigBlueMongoose,1552859682,/r/college/comments/b2ajf7/im_a_firstyear_having_trouble_making_solid/,"Hello!

I've always had a pretty close group of friends growing up. However, while I've been here, I feel like I've made a lot of acquaintances but very few close friendships (if any at all). For example, I eat with some people from my classes every so often and I work on homework/study with them pretty often. In any of these cases, I feel like I enjoy their company but I don't just ""hang out"" with them regularly like they do with each other. For context, I also have a girlfriend who I've been with for a while here and she's awesome.

I've always had the privilege of having a close circle of friends in high school and in other activities I've done but here, for the first time, I feel very alone and friendless. I have been dealing with pretty bad (clinical)depression since my last year of high school and my hypothesis now is that I've become somewhat of a fragment of a person that's just too boring to connect with others. I try to be considerate and to remember things about people and to ask about them but it always seems like they would rather be with their real friends than me.

I'm pretty sick of it, to be honest. Going through every day is agonizing and I think having friends like I did would make it better. I've noticed that I feel better about myself and everything else when I have a social interaction that I judge to be positive for both the person/people I'm talking to and I. I want to change and I want to be better but I feel broken.

I'd imagine that my experience is quite common for freshmen so in r/learnmath's fashion, I will explain what I've done and ask for advice from those who are more knowledgeable on the kind of things that might be to come.

I've sought out medical treatment(medication, therapy) for my condition and I've tried to just be myself around people more. I've also started exercising every day. I plan on joining some relevant clubs(possibly an org/frat) to me next quarter so I can put myself out there more and also so I can do more things(generally, I don't do a lot right now. My day is mostly spend on Youtube and studying).

A large piece of advice I see on making close friends is that I should organize my own hang outs and invite people even if I don't feel that close to them. However, I've always struggled with that and especially now, I would have a really hard time doing that. However, if it really seems like that's the one thing I need to do to improve everything, then I absolutely will do it.

For those of you who've gone through something even remotely similar, did it help? Is it worth the effort? I get scared that I already have what I want and I just don't realize it but I feel like something's different... but I suppose that might just be how college is.

My experience here has been completely awful and I think has contributed to how depressed I've been feeling lately.

Because of how prestigious the school is, most people are very intelligent, and while I don't consider myself stupid I've never possessed the same drive, intellectual curiosity, and quick wit that many students here have. I would say I do have the same raw intelligence, I was tested in the gifted range (&gt;130 IQ) as a child, although that could've changed, not that IQ really matters that much. This leads people to write me off as stupid, which is very annoying. I don't really care about my schoolwork because I'm a CS major and even the people here who got all C's and D's and have 2.0 GPAs get jobs . I also gained a shit-ton of weight after I came here because I guess I partially wanted to not have to talk to anyone, the thing is, everyone here is so fucking judgmental and it's not even just because of my weight like you might be thinking. I have to listen to profs talk shit about poor people all the time (sorry my parents were poor??? sorry everyone doesn't have amazing life circumstances??), shit-talk introverts, minorities get shit-talked and excluded all the time from everything by profs and students, and this is made worse because there is a noticeable cognitive deficit in the minorities that attend because of affirmative action - this discourages a lot of minorities who may be just as smart, and gives all minorities at the university a bad reputation. Even just the things people talk about here, everyone is obsessed with sex and relationships and looking youthful and it makes me fucking sick honestly. Not to mention, the classes are fucking hard and most people have to try like hell to get decent (&gt;3.2 GPA) grades unless they're in an easy major. Profs rarely fail people here so I basically just do jack shit and get B's and C's anyway, so it's like, what's the point? I even got an A in a 200 level CS class where I did absolutely nothing this semester.

I'm on winter break now and it's been amazing being away from that horrible environment, but I seriously dread going back. I won't transfer out because I am still grateful that I get to attend such a prestigious institution (plus I did work to get in here when I was a CC student, getting a 3.9 in CS even at a CC isn't completely trivial), and I'll be able to say that I graduated from there for the rest of my life, but I don't know how I'm going to make it. I'm so bored and sad that I just do a bunch of drugs and eat a bunch of food every day and it's making my health worse and worse, continuing the cycle of sadness. When I was at CC, I was constantly working towards getting into this school and it made me feel amazing about myself, but now that I'm here I just feel like shit. I had no friends at the CC either but I at least was friendly with people, I had people I could talk to when I wanted. Here, I really have no friends. Hardly anyone knows my name and people here just treat me like shit. People warned me about coming to this school as a minority/gay guy/fat person/poor person/blah blah blah but I didn't listen - maybe I should have....

Everyone is going to say ""see a therapist"" but I already am. The therapy has mostly just confirmed what I already knew about myself and hasn't really helped me much. My goals were to stop relying on substances and connect with others more, and I want to do that less than ever now. I just want to be alone and die I guess. When I get out of college I'm probably just gonna get in some coding job that I hate, and it won't be much better than my current situation.

64,CatOwlFilms,1546228717,/r/college/comments/ab3fvs/im_unsure_of_my_path_in_college_and_after_and_am/,"I'm a freshman at Notre Dame who just finished his first semester, and I'm using my time on winter break to plan out what major I should take and what course I want my life to take afterwards. Right now I'm in ND's College of Business and by the end of this year I'll be halfway done with the Econ major (which is in ND's College of Arts &amp; Letters, not Business). 

After taking a class in management, I'm not really sure if I want to continue in business. The only reason I'm in it is because it's hard to get into at Notre Dame unless you apply for it as a high school senior, and since I thought I might be interested in it I applied for it. I figured that if I didn't like it, it would be easy for me to transfer out of it. My parents want me to continue in it because ND's undergrad business program is very well regarded (top 3) and business can open a lot of doors.. in industry. To that end, the vast majority of people in that college go work in business (go figure) for generally one of fifteen companies like Deloitte, but, to be honest, I don't really see myself doing that. I'm much too ambitious to settle for just a path in business. The college of business requires too many classes for me to pursue something I'm not that interested in, and besides, can't I just get my MBA if I wanna do business later?

In contrast, I've been interested in similarities between the physical world and how society runs. I'm very much interested in expanding on that thought process into formal research and writings; to that end, I've been interested in getting a PhD, especially in economics (as much of how society organized itself is through economics, and I'm interested in the subject itself). To that end, I've been taking Econ and math courses for grad school, and have looked into various business/econ internships (at least abroad for this summer). Because I want to connect that with the physical world,  I've looked into taking ND's physics supplemental major. Though I only took one physics class in HS I liked it, I really, really enjoyed reading *A Brief History of Time,* and I'm good at and enjoy math. Thus, the physics major seems good to me. In addition to this, ND has a neat Philosophy, Science, and Math major which I could get with five classes in addition to the math courses I'd take. Because I like thinking about science in a bit of a philosophical point of view, it seems like that program would be a good fit for me.  Thus, I guess the current plan is to major in Econ, PSM, and maybe Physics, and drop my place in the business college. Then I'd go onto an Econ PhD, hopefully in a prestigious university in the UK or elsewhere in Europe (I  wanna live abroad at least for a few years).

My issues with this are the following:

1. As my parents and peers keep on telling me, getting a BBA from ND is a fairly good way to make sure I'm financially stable in the future. I'm worried a bit about losing that security for this. 
2. This plan is  pretty hard on me on multiple fronts. Getting a triple major would be very difficult as I'd have to overload multiple semesters, and I've read on this sub that triple majoring doesn't even look very good. Moreover, not getting into a prestigious econ PhD program anywhere is obviously a very real possibility. And, if I did get in, getting a PhD is very difficult. While I'm passionate about the subject and I have a good work ethic and writing skill, it's still obviously hard to do no matter what.
3. This path sets me up well for academia, but I'm not sure I wanna do that for the rest of my life. I love learning and I think I'd like teaching college, but everything I've heard about academia's politics and overall quality of life is bad.
4. Instead of academia, I have other career interests too, like policy advising (especially about climate change), doing some international development work, maybe getting into politics myself, and again, maybe business. I'm not sure I'd set myself up that well with this plan.

Finally, I'm not sure if I should even stay at ND, and I think I have a fair shot at getting into a school that better suits me.  I hate how insular the campus is, I hate its location, the social life is... lame, its pre-professional nature doesn't line up well with my own more academic interests, much of its academic offerings aren't the *absolute* best, and my individualist streak doesn't match its emphasis on conformity. On the other hand, I love how friendly people are here, I like that the school cares for its undergrads by having good teachers and research opportunities (though advising and choosing classes is poor), and I love that I'd always have ND connections to rely on. Plus, it's close to home and other than UChicago I don't know where I'd apply.

Sorry for the wall of text -- I'm in a weird point in life and I don't know where I'm going. If anyone has any advice for me (like addressing my worries or whether any of my plans make sense) I'd be uber grateful. Thank you for reading if you made it this far!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I don't like the path I'm taking in business, I have some academic interests I'd like to pursue via double- or even triple-majoring with a PhD, but I'm still not sure if that's the path for me for various reasons. Also, I don't know if I should stay in my current college or go elsewhere, so any advice would be very much appreciated!",college,"I'm unsure of my path in college and after, and am considering everything from business to physics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ab3fvs/im_unsure_of_my_path_in_college_and_after_and_am/,1546246717.0
65,StardustNyako,1546094948,/r/college/comments/aalquv/sharing_my_college_journey_in_hopes_that_it/,"Soo, I've had a non- traditional sort of journey, attempting to get through college. I debated whether or not to share this and was inspired by recent personal threads people have posted here to do so. Please understand though, this is word vomit and won't be well structured.

Soo, I went to an ultra competitive magnet school just to learn Japanese cause, I wanted to watch anime without subs.

Really I didn't have plans for high school or b what I would do after that. High school was just something I had to get through, along with college after that. Although I sorta knew I needed to take APs to look good for colleges, my school was literally number 2 in Texas. Classes were intense, even non honor classes, so I played it safe and decided not to take those AP classes. In reality, I should have just stayed at the school I was zoned to and got in the top 10 percent or atleast gonig there would have allowed me to feel safe taknig AP classes. That magnet school experience caused me to go from the confident smart girl to the kinda lost girl. This was my fault, I chose to stay at this school in hopes it would get me into a good college. It barely helped me at all.

I moved between my junior and senior year. Was going to get kicked out of this language magnet school anyway due to my grades in Algebra 2 and Physics. (LOL and yall are talking about taking Calc and I was still in Algebra 2 as a Junior lolololol). Moving to another state right before college app season hit added a whole layer of complexity and stress to the process. I was having to email my counselor, teachers and such, trying my damn best to line all my ducks up. But even then, there was so much out of my control, and I was not able to go to the school and meet with these people in person. I was needing to sit there and pray they understood what I needed from them. Well some schools didn't get everything they needed as a result of this mess. When all was said and done, I only got into UPitt cause they had other campuses they opened up to students they want to admiot but don't have room for at their main campus, and I got in at the campus I ranked as the campus I wanted to go to least.

That summer though , my mom lost her job, and even though she got one that payed an equal amount before I was supposed to go to college, she still asked that I start at a community college. So I did. I was happy I was saving money, but at the same time, the community college path tends to kinda make the college journey feel mroe stretched out and tedious than if you were to go to a 4 year to begin with, especially when your school has no classes linked to my major at the time Japanese. I had wanted to teach Japanese as a career, but finally came to my senses and decided this career path was not a good idea - I was never really able to connect with kids or get them to listen / respect me without another adult needing to step in. I also hated the idea of needing to teach the same lessons every year . . .I became lost as to what I really wanted to do, and knew I was just wasting my time at colleg, so I withdrew from my classes. I didn't think I was going back. I had done research and saw that college was not the olnly way to succeed

I went home , sat in front of my PC and tried to plan out my next move. However, it was difficult, because outside my door, my sister's new boyfriend was verbally abusing and taunting my nephew constantly, and giving him ruthless spankings that made the kid scream. I tried to stop that because I cared deeply for my nephew, however the boyfriend just got aggressive with me, told me to mind my own business, and made my own life hell, getting in my business, bossing me around over my life and what I could and couldn't do in the house. My mom didn't want to confront him or my sister, and so she just wanted me to listen to them. My mom also didn't want me getting mad at or criticizing my little sister who is autistic, and coddled by my mom, not getting the help she needs to succeed despite her handy cap, which she absolutely can succeed with the right help. She can communicate and learn , just slowly, but for a long time, people dragged their feet in pushing her. I just mention that all to paint the picture of the difficult home life I was dealing with while needing to forge a life for myself. Things got somewhat better but, still ehh

I remembered I'd always wanted to learn how to fix PCs, so I decided to go to trade school to learn how to fix PCs. I went to trade school for nine months, while working a part time job to pay for it. It was a tough time filled with hard work, but I got through it, and I'm damn proud of that. I earned two CompTIA certs: A+ and Network+. I had a contract job lined up before I graduated. However, after that contract job, I couldn't land any other job, all other companies wanted more experience or a degree . . .for a job that pays 12.50 an hour lol. So I gave in reluctantly and admitted I would need a degree to go forward since I wanted to work for a semi big company in an office. Why? My life even before this has been, insane, and, I just want to try to get back to some sort of ""normalcy"" .

I tried programming, realized I liked it. I began working on my AS in Comp Science at my local CC and I am finishing that now and am applying to 4 years to transfer, going through the application process again . So far I've had, better luck. My biggest dream is UMich as many of you know. My pre-withdrawng grades dropped my GPA some, but I am currently at a 3.46 GPA . . .hoping my essay are strong enough that UMich takes me. Two friends who helped me get through tough times go there, it'd be nice to study there with them.

This whole process taught me to have patience, and even though life can kinda throw you in to a crazy ride, hold on and ride it through, find beauty in the sites the ride takes you through, and do your best to understand why you are taking this ride and what can be gained from it. I gained patience, and a crazy strong determination to leave my house and make a life for myself with good friends and family. I never dreamed about my future before going down this path, now I feel like I'n working hard for a warm happy future, and it gives me the strength to keep going.

OKKKKK I'm done, sorrry for the masso post. Thank you so, so much for reading, hope you got someting out of that. Always wear your seat belt.

66,kinderlagenbmc,1541889155,/r/college/comments/9vyjvt/cant_tell_if_people_actually_like_me_19f/,"Hey all. I wasn't really sure where to post this since it's a social/non-romantic relationships issue, but it's happening in college so here I am. 

I'm in my freshman year of college at a super small all women's school (like, 1700 undergrads small). I haven't really made any close friends or cultivated a ""group"" like it seems everyone else has. I've never had this problem before. I had lots of friends in high school, one solid best friend throughout all the 4 years, and I still keep in touch with some of the closer ones. I've been going to summer camp since I was a little kid, and I have *always* made friends quickly. I have always had a group. 

It's kind of killing me, not being social like I'm used to. I'm a social person, I thrive on connections with other people. I feel like I did all the right things - I joined the choir at my college, I auditioned for (and got into) the first mainstage play of the year, I talk to people in my classes, but it just has not happened. No connections have been lasting, and I have no idea why. 

Theatre was my community in high school and I loved it, so I thought this play would be a great opportunity to make friends, but even with the everyday rehearsals and hours of time we all spend together, I haven't made a single friend that I hang out with outside of rehearsals. Recently I've really been making an effort to get to know people in the show, so I went to the opening night party. It was a lot of fun, we all drank, smoked some weed, had a good time. I made some drunk plans with people that I was really hoping would actually happen (i.e, ""we should go to a party at \_\_\_\_\_ campus tomorrow night!"" me: ""yeah 100%!"") but now that it's the next day and we're all sober, I'm getting the feeling that nobody actually likes me and that I was *hella* annoying at the party. 

I legitimately cannot tell if people actually like me or if I'm one of *those* people who tries too hard and everybody thinks is annoying, and it's driving me insane! I'm usually a very self-aware person, I consider myself generally pretty good at reading people's faces and feelings and being able to tell if I'm wanted in a space or not. But here (I moved 1,000 miles away from home for school) I have ZERO idea if I'm liked or not. I want to keep reaching out to people from my show, suggesting we go to parties together or get food outside of rehearsals, but not if it's unwelcome. I'm getting the intense urge to withdraw completely and not talk to any of them so I don't bother them and seem like I'm trying too hard, but that could also just be a product of my own anxiety and not the reality of how they feel. It's driving me insane. 

I don't know what to do. In my hometown it was so easy to make friends, it's not a small town or anything, but I just felt like I knew the culture and connected with the people my age relatively easily. But here I can't read people, I can't seem to connect with anyone, and I'm losing my mind. It's making me feel like I'm a weird kid, like, the ways through which I make friends usually, aren't working. People don't find me funny the same way, I feel like I get weird looks, it feels like not a single person here likes me. 

For Christ's sake, I've gone on youth trips to fucking Fiji and Belize that consisted of random hodge-podges of kids from all over the country and on BOTH of those trips I cultivated a solid friend group within the first 3 days. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Help.

I went to a small high school where I had a really big group of close friends. We would all hang out and party all the time. I was the star of the soccer and track teams and everyone knew me as an athlete and a funny kid.
Now im not saying I wish to go back to high school but so far college has been a drag and Im not having a fun time.

I go to school about a hour away from home. I dont have my car at school and my parents bring me home for a night almost every weekend. Im on the soccer team and having my ups and downs but its going mostly well there.

I miss my friends terribly all the time, and Im having a of trouble making new ones. All my friends are hanging out and throwing parties on their dorm floor, and i feel im missing out. I know nobody on the dorm floor and ive inly made one or two friends in my classes.
Nobody sees to wantto reach out or do anything. Ive tried reaching out to people and setting up hangouts but nobody ever wanted to so now ive given up even on that.

I basically go to class, go to the library and then go bac to my room and sleep every single day. This is only broken up by my soccer games and practices, but even those I have come to hate because they interfere heavily with my ability to come home on the weekends.

I like for the few days a month I can spend at home. I miss my family constantly, I spend at least an hour a day on the phone with my parents and whenever i come home I make sure to spend as much time as I can hanging out with my handful of high school friends who stayed local.

The college food here is getting old fast and half the time I dont even eat anything. Im even starting to lose the motivation to do my schooleork. Im just counting down the days until everybody will be home for Thanksgiving again.

Sometimes i think i made the wrong choice of school. I go to a very free-thinking school, and many of the kids that go here are either LGBT or inner city type kids. Now i have no issues at all with that and I seek no problems with anyone, but as somebdy who grew up in a very sheltered town, I find it very hard to identify and really connect with most kids here

Its affected my confidence as well. I barely care about the soccer team anymore and I find it harder to get out there and play. Overall im just not haply so im just getting this out there.

I didn't have a whole lot of friends in high school, only like 3 or 4, followed by a few acquaintances, but that combined with seeing my parents/family everyday was socially satisfying even though I didn't do anything wild like parties, football games etc. In college I actually have a better social life than I did in high school. I go to parties now, have friends I connect with pretty well, and have a budding number of a acquaintances. The hard thing about college though is the immense effort it takes to see these people-you don't automatically get to see them everyday at the cafeteria etc like in high school. Proximity is a bitch when it comes to maintaining friendships, and now that I'm out of the dorms everyone feels even more disconnected. My apartment mates are great friends, but what I find myself missing most is living with my parents. I miss being immersed in friendship 6 hours a day in class in high school and then going to the comfort of my own house with my mom and dad and dog. I'm really close with my mom especially, and sometimes just miss her so much it's hard to take. Now I only see her on holidays! I did go home for summer (I am a sophomore now) and it was really nice being back with her but not the same. I felt bored and trapped in my hometown, and all my friends from high school were so busy we barely hung out. The freedom and optimism for the future also just seems gone now. In high school, college was a clean slate for everything-grades (which I mildly have already screwed up), friendship, relationships, etc. In high school, the complexities of all 3 of these could be ignored-it was something you could look forward to while still not having to deal with quite yet. That made senior year of high school feel amazingly hopeful while still being able to cherish my childhood life. Now i am immersed in the complexities of all 3 and find myself wishing to go back to the time where it was all ahead of me.

So last week I learned that I got into an exchange program with TU Munich and my school for next semester. The study abroad adviser also told me that I was the ONLY STUDENT AT MY SCHOOL WHO APPLIED. This means I am the only one going. I really wanted to go abroad when I applied but now it is suddenly dawning on me exactly what that entails. 

I'm not really a very social person and although I've made friends in college, they are not super close friends and I often feel kinda lonely. I was kinda envisioning getting an apartment in Munich with the other people from my school who were doing the study abroad, we could hang out and be american friends together. But now I am going to go alone for four months to a country where I can't speak the language well. On top of that I guess I'm going to have to take thermodynamics in fucking German?? WTF am I even doing? Who am I going to spend time with? Who is going to be friends with a dude who can't even speak their language? Even if I find a roommate somewhere online it feels like its going to be impossible to connect with them. When I join clubs and shit now at my school (where I speak the freaking language) I have a really hard time feeling comfortable with people or making friends. Now I have to do that in German? I feel like I'm going to arrive there and just keel over and fucking die.

My girlfriend also dumped me kinda suddenly a few weeks before the school year started, since then it has been hard to be by myself without feeling shitty. I know this will get better with time, but its certainly not helping me feel less panicked right now.

Just don't go to Germany you say? There is a $1,500 fee for withdrawing from the program after being accepted :( I am almost feeling bad enough to pay it.

As usual, we dread it, we love it, it's our life and we have to put up with it if we want that $50,000 piece of paper. I want to hear about your school set-up, what's your gear and how has you major impacted that. Anything you call a must have that makes life easier? What laptop do you use and why did you role with it? Tips and Tricks that help you stay organized?

I myself am a biomedical engineering student at Arizona State University, and my set-up is pretty clean and simple.

Gear:

I'm rocking a North Face surge. It has all the space I could ask for, including a tablet compartment in the front that is hidden but is the perfect size for putting in wires and tablets and small notebooks. The other bigger compartments open up all the way, and I mean ALL the way. You could butterfly this pack and it's awesome.

I use composition notebooks for notes, 100 page college ruled. Writing with Pilot Precise v5. One thing I will add here. DO NOT CHEAP OUT ON PENS. I obviously don't need to buy $15 pens, I'm just taking down notes and the drawing I do are only as fancy as transport systems. But cheap pens are a nightmare, I shoot to spend \~$1- $2 per pen and get nice, thin, and continuous lines.

Laptop I use a MacBook Pro. It can handle everything and anything I throw at it. No windows updates, No crashes, it just works. I enjoy the look of it and feel. Battery life is phenomenal (coming from a SurfacePro 4) and I only need to charge it about twice a day when running Fusion 360, Matlab, or Python all day. It's a small pleasure in life I enjoy. (Remember, if you use your laptop for school it could be tax deductible.)

Software:

Microsoft Suite ALL DAY. No Pages or any of Apple's shitty derivatives. Acrobat for PDFs, however I am looking to find a program that works better than Acrobat. Something that allows me to write notes on a PDF. I used to use OneNote when I had my surface, but it was unreliable as it glitched out a lot and sometimes would just not load any of my PDFs once I had a notebook with 17+ worth of lecture slides on it. Inkscape for making graphics. Brackets as my go-to Notepad++ substitute. Spotify for spotifying. Android File Transfer to connect my Pixel 2 XL to my laptop. 

Must-Haves:

I don't have many, I just have what I find to be my necessity. For one, water bottle. Thermoflask 40 fl. oz which I am committed to filling with stickers. You need water to live, and being in AZ you need water to survive the walk from class to class. Audiotechnica ATH-M40x, great over-ear headphones for music, videos, and keeping the sound in your ears and keep sounds out of your ears. Chargers, USB-C all the things. Phone, Laptop, Hard Drive, all USB-C. I only carry my MacBook charger and wire (I don't typically need to charge both, laptop acts as my phone with hangouts when it's dead). Wireless headphones, these are the one item I never knew I needed until I had them. Jaybird Freedoms were $50 and last me about 7-10 hr with the included back-up battery.

I don't know anyone who has attended a small liberal arts school, so I was hoping that maybe there might be others on reddit with the same experience. 
I just finished my first year at a small liberal arts college (~2k enrolled) and I've had pretty conflicting feelings about my experience. I don't know if this is just a problem limited to my college, but there aren't a lot of club activities to get involved in at all (everything is inactive or there's like 10 member clubs that meet up a couple times a month) and there just hasn't been much to do. My life my first year was almost entirely surrounded around studying, doing research, or working on homework. I find that a lot of social interactions on campus are limited to meeting through classes/academic work, getting meals with random people, or getting trashed on the weekend at one of the only 2 parties on campus. I had no problems interacting with people in high school, but upon entering college, I've found it so difficult to meet new people that I truly connect with because there's not many opportunities to meet people outside of my classes (10-30 class size, too lol) and I just see the same people every day. Everyone seems to be making friends by just asking new people to get dinner/lunch, but it just feels so oddly formal to me. Academic life is great, but my social life has become extremely mundane. Everyone I know from high school ended up attending a large research university/community college and their experiences seem so much more exciting and significantly different from mine, and I can't help but feel sometimes that I might have made a mistake in choosing my school. I thought that it wouldn't be much different, and that small class sizes were just an added perk. But it has honestly felt so suffocating this year and I don't know what to do. I've considered transferring but I feel like I should stick it through since I'm already here. I simply don't want to continue to feel this way for the remaining 3 years. 
I just wanted to know if anyone who has attended a liberal arts college has also felt this way or if my experience is just isolated. If you've experienced this, how did you deal with it? If you haven't, how is the experience like at other liberal arts colleges? There are only so many students attending these schools so it has been hard for me to connect with people who have attended.

It's really frustrating being around students who I do better than who have parents who make 100k\+ a year, have connections etc. It feels like I'm working twice as hard for half as much. I overheard a premed guy talk about he got into a lab I wanted to work in over the summer because his dad knew the head of the department and my blood was boiling.

No summer program accepted me because I only had one semester here. Meanwhile, I'm working as a tutor helping kids who have their parents paying for them to get Ds in all their classes.

I also just don't feel like I fit in with anybody. People around me had parents buy them cars when they turned 16, go to cancun for spring break etc. It's just such a weird world to me.

I came to the US in order to get into NYU, which always been my dream school. 
I worked very hard at community college &amp; ended up applying to NYU Arts &amp; Science for Econ as a transfer with a 3.8, a tech start up internship, involvement at NYU itself, and a lot of ECs related to my major. I speak 5 languages and my English is now fluent (I believe). Along with that I submitted 2 letters of recommendations, one of my finance professor and one of my advisor/faculty mentor who wrote about me leading my schools team for the Fed Challenge.  

I talked to many people, professors, NYU transfer &amp; Econ students, literally everybody told me I’m a shoe in and i shouldn’t “stress”, that i would get in so I was pretty positive.

I got rejected and did NOT expect it. NYU was the only college I applied to. (Dumb I know, don’t tell me)

My lease is up May and I have a flight to Paris May 28 so I’m VERY stressed about what’s next. 

Now my alternatives in the US are, since most deadlines passed, either 
1) stay at my community college and finish to get my associates (I got one last semester)
2) going to Baruch (automatic transfer since I go to CUNY) or Fordham which I’m not fond of. 

That would mean I’ll have to come back to the US, reapply for a visa, find a place, get a storage etc etc. which is basically annoying. 
I’m not even sure that I can transfer if I choose 1) because I been at this community college since Fall 2015 (took me longer to graduate because I had an F and dropped a class)

I recently started reevaluating staying in the US. 
I am thinking about going back to Paris to transfer my credits to American University of Paris so I would’ve not wasted my time and money. 

The main reason for me wanting to go back home is, in the 3 years I’ve been living in the states, i been very depressed and alone. I have no family members, relatives or friends in the USA. I know some people from school but I don’t have close friends. I truly miss my parents and home in general. I basically feel like I wasted my time living here but it is what it is. 

My main concern is, is it a good idea?
I plan to go to grad school in England or the US.

Should I transfer to American University of Paris (which is waaaay cheaper than a low tier US college AND I get financial aid since I’m french, also I’ll be rent free) or stick it in and go to Baruch/Fordham?
Would I be able to get into a good grad school if I get my bachelors from American University of Paris ? 

I was seeking prestige when coming here but at this point I need to pick the best option for me &amp; my career goals. 

My parents can’t give me advice or connect me to opportunities like some kids so the school I choose is kinda a big factor that’s why I’m so stressed out. 

Thanks a LOT for any advice. I love Reddit it feels like a family I can reach to.

75,jkhso,1514419531,/r/college/comments/7miwi1/10_things_i_learned_during_my_first_semester_of/,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a good break! I just finished my first semester of college and wanted to share few things I personally learned. Hopefully this can help current and future students!

&amp;nbsp;

**1. College is damn expensive**
&amp;nbsp;
College is expensive, and I think everyone knows that. Regardless of whether your parent are paying for them or you're getting a loan, do not waste money by not giving 110% effort. You are there to to learn and succeed, not to go out every night and fail classes. I'm not saying you can't have fun, but make sure you set your priorities straight before it's too late. If you're getting a loan, I think you should sacrifice more 

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Talk to your parents often**
&amp;nbsp;
We are probably all enjoying this newly found freedom in college without our parents being on our ass 24/7. Although this might be nice, you will most likely never see them as often as you did in high school. Always make sure to let them know you love them because soon they might not be here anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Hard work will beat intelligence** 
&amp;nbsp;
Some people are naturally smarter, and it really does suck. But don't let this be an excuse to lowering your expectations. I have met so many people who aren't naturally smart but has worked extremely hard to get A's.  Also, if you're smart don't rub it in. It's pretty douchey. 

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Find what studying style works for you**
&amp;nbsp;
Just because your friends study a certain way doesn't mean it will work for you. I wasted the first month of my college frantically taking notes and realized that I'm just spitting the what my professor said onto a paper rather than trying to understand it. And most of them time, the professor will post lecture notes online. Finding what worked for me helped me save a lot of time.

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Don't skip class**
&amp;nbsp;
Like I said, college is expensive. It might not feel like it, but you're wasting so much money every time you're skipping class. Even if you don't think it's helpful, go. Form new relationships and get to know the teacher. Who knows, you might end up needing to ask for letter of recs from the teacher of the class you always skipped. 

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Get out of your room**
&amp;nbsp;
Do not stay in your room all day. There are so many people in college, there is someone who you can connect with. Make some friends. Find a date. Do something other than being in your room all day. It's not healthy and you will regret it. 

&amp;nbsp;

**7. Find some sort of activity that will keep you or get you into shape**
&amp;nbsp;
Exercising is not only good for looking good but it will help you get better grades and stay healthy. Don't let yourself get out of shape because it's hard to get back in. Plus it's not attractive :P. Stay fit. It's good for you.

&amp;nbsp;

**8. Partying/drinking is not ""cool""**
&amp;nbsp;
As everyone probably know, partying and drinking is huge in college. I'm not against them, and I personally think they can be fun. But I do have a problem with how they are praised to be ""cool"". Like some kids think it's ""cool"" to get plastered and black out and puke. They brag to their friends next morning about how ""hard"" they went and people praise them. Honestly, this is not the case. Remember if you're only doing things to look ""cool"", chances are, you're probably not cool lol. Also, everything in moderation. 

&amp;nbsp;

**9. Keep your integrity and don't lose yourself** 
&amp;nbsp;
You will probably change drastically throughout college. I know I did. But make sure you don't lose sight of who you are. Sure you might find new hobbies and interests, but don't be someone who you're not. Don't cheat on homework or test because you didn't study. Don't be an asshole because you think it will make you look cooler. Don't fall under peer pressure. Always make sure you put school on top of the priority list. Just be responsible.  

&amp;nbsp;

**10. Have fun! Socialize! Gain new perspective and learn about new cultures!** 
&amp;nbsp;
These are 4 years of life you will never experience again. If you regret doing or not doing something in high school do it! If you like a guy or a girl, ask her out! Don't be a Pu**y! If you want to be more outgoing, be more outgoing because you are starting fresh. So is everyone else! If you think it's weird to talk to people in class or anywhere, you're wrong. I'm sure you would love if people came to talk to you! Don't only talk to people you are comfortable with. Talk to all kinds of people! It will help you become a more complete person!

&amp;nbsp;

**11. G.P.A. is just a number**
&amp;nbsp;
I'm not saying don't get good grades, but make sure you're not killing yourself over a 4.0. Although a good G.P.A. is helpful, recruiters look at your people skills and experience. I managed to get an internship as a freshmen year  even thought I don't have a college G.P.A. thanks to my ability to talk to people. Become a well rounded person and don't pull hairs for a silly number! (People seem think I'm saying GPA doesn't matter. Of course it matters. You should always aim to have a high GPA. I'm just saying, don't kill yourself because you got a 3.9 over a 4.0.) 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading guys! I just wanted to share my thoughts about college. This is purely my opinion so please don't think this is what everyone thinks. If you agree or disagree, I would love to talk about them! Feel free to ask any questions! Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, I didn't proofread lol.

77,__collegethroway__,1489440284,/r/college/comments/5z7v3u/college_transfer_decision_help/,"I was giving some major thought into transferring into a different college this next semester and wanted to get advice from as many people as I possibly could. To give y'all some background, I am currently a freshman at Indiana University as a direct admit into the Kelley School of Business, which is the top public business school in the nation and top 10 in the U.S. I came into IU not knowing a soul. I came from out of state (from the south) and no one from my high school went there either.
However, in the semester and a half that I have been there, I have failed to make a single friend. I think there are a couple reasons for this, but there are three main ones. Firstly, I chose to live on the honors floor, and quite frankly, about 3/5 of the people on my floor have a hard time interacting socially, and it's been hard connecting with the other 2/5 because everyone's doors are always closed and everyone is studying the majority of the time. With that in mind, I am still a pretty introverted person and find it hard to start conversations and connect with people. To try and combat this, I've joined three different clubs to try and meet new people, but nothing has seemed to work.
At this point, about 7 months into college, I am pretty tired of having no friends and no one to talk to. The school is about 40,000 people so it is near impossible to accidentally run into any familiar faces. My day consists of eating, listening to hours of podcasts, doing lots of homework (because the school is pretty tough), attempting and failing to make friends, and sleeping. I am honestly tired of this routine and am seriously considering transferring to a different school. The only reason that I am hesitant to transfer is that the prestige of the degree and the opportunities I would get from IU is probably greater than any other degree I could get if I transferred. Getting the degree from IU would most likely set me up for my future career better than any other degree, but it is hard to justify going through 4 years of unhappiness, loneliness, and not enjoying my college experience in the slightest in order to get that, especially when I have a lot of options as to possible colleges I could go to (4.3 HS, 3.9 College GPAs, 32 ACT).
I was hoping to get some advice on how to think about this trade-off or pro/con of staying at IU (which I simply am not having a good experience at) vs. transferring. Any advice would be greatly appreciated or just any advice in general.

78,ToastyBB,1488726241,/r/college/comments/5xn5yj/these_english_assignments/,"Hey all, was just wondering what other students' thoughts on this was. I'm a freshman taking what i think is the most basic English class, and i gotta say that i don't connect with any of the assigned readings at all. I understand that 100 years ago really is not that long ago at all in our history, but damn if writing from as recent as the 70's don't feel outdated. I just simply don't connect with what's assigned in any way. It's hard to write about something you don't find interesting, and i have to write about 1-2 pages on 3 different subjects weekly. And this is like literally the first english class so i can't imagine what the future may hold. It's actually my 2nd time taking an introductory English class because i just didn't have the care to do all the work for everything, and it's assignments like these that make me fall into a rut. It's just hard for me to care if i literally do not connect with a single line from 20 pages(or with other assignments from any class). How does everybody else handle situations like this? Also, i get that it's supposed to be hard, and it will only get harder. But the only thing i'm having real difficulty with is just making myself read the work that's honestly just not interesting(At least to me)

79,itlk123,1487541881,/r/college/comments/5v0r3h/trouble_making_friends_as_a_transfer_student/,"After a great first year at my original college, I felt that I could do better academically, so I transferred to a larger, elite research university. Since I had no problems making friends at all as a freshman or at any time in my life previously, I thought it would be easy to transfer in socially, but I was gravely mistaken. I have found it incredibly difficult to meet people that I connect with at this school. My current school is a research university with an acceptance rate around 10 percent, and thus I would say about 80 percent of the people here are either very socially awkward or so consumed by their studies that they can barely even squeeze in a social life. My living situation is an 8 person suite consisting of athletes who are never present and STEM students who can barely hold a conversation. My transfer orientation group was a group of music students who had all transferred from the same program at the same school int order to follow a teacher, and thus already knew each other. I tried to join a couple of clubs in the fall but did not realize how insanely competitive the club culture here was. While at most universities, you can join a club by simply emailing the person in charge and expressing interest, joining clubs at my new school only happens during a three week recruiting period at the beginning of the fall, and a smaller number of clubs recruit during a similar period at the beginning of the spring. Many clubs require multiple rounds of interviews during which they cut the majority of applicants, and are very hesitant to take non-freshmen, as they want people who will stay in the club for all four years. Not realizing this, I applied to only a small number of clubs and was ultimately rejected by all of them. The same story happened with greek life, where I came into rush almost completely unknown and had my value reduced by virtue of not being a freshman. I don't really know how to make friends at this point, considering that clubs and greek life are not an option, and my living situation is not at all conducive to meeting people. I honestly feel like I'm trapped at a university that I don't enjoy, and while I know that I am getting an elite education, I can't help but miss my old liberal arts college where I had a sense of community. I feel extremely alone here, which is staring to have impacts on my mental health, and I feel like I have no viable avenues through which to make friends, I can't join a club, I don't meet people in my building, I can't meet friends of friends because that requires having friends in the first place. I've considered transferring again but everyone I have talked to about it says that attending three colleges would raise red flags for future employers, and it would not solve the problem of me not knowing people at my college. I am honestly feeling very lost because I definitely do not want to stay here for two and a half more years, but I have worked way too hard to drop out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

80,Oniigiri,1485848155,/r/college/comments/5r6ubm/how_to_cope_with_cultural_difference_and/,"Hey guys, I'm typing this out because I feel that I've been stuck in a rut for a while and my situation isn't helping at all. So I entered college as a freshman last August in a different state (I'm from CA), and up until recently I've been doing alright. At first I tolerated the cultural difference (my home state was more racially diverse than my current one, which is predominantly white and I'm Asian) because I had my girlfriend to talk to who was back at home. She kept me busy during our free time and I didn't have to worry about making new friends or meeting new people that I can relate with. 

Recently however our relationship ended, so consequently I haven't talked to her ever since, and this is where reality starts hitting me:

* Being raised and growing up with Asian friends, my culture and comfort zone revolves around those kinds of people, where the University I'm attending (as well as the actual state) is mostly white. The Asians that do attend this uni are international students that don't speak English fluently and keep to their own cliques 

* My roommates (there are 4 of us) have pretty much alienated me from their activities because I cannot speak Chinese, so whenever they go out to do things I'm just in the dorm killing time by watching YouTube/Reddit/Facebook

* The clubs in this university don't have a wide variety, they're mainly business groups and not very focused on interest (the specific college I'm in is focused on business majors), so it's difficult to find particular groups that I can relate with (e.g. Korean American Student Association [KASA], Japanese Student Association [JPA], etc)

* I'm not very into sports but the university holds its football team on a pedestal 


Any advice on what I can do to get a life? Should I just integrate? I feel like I'm an outsider and can't connect with anyone here, and that it is especiallt hard to make friends if class sizes average 300+ people and it is unlikely that people would have 3 of the same classes. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.

81,ShiveringAurora,1474507054,/r/college/comments/53wkrd/is_giving_up_on_partying_a_sensible_thing_to_do/,"So not long ago I got into one of the nicest universities of London, and after years of living in a tiny, tiny town in Eastern Europe it's been an enormous change of the pace of living - during the last 2 weeks I've traveled here on my own, settled in, switched to an English-speaking environment, sorted out most of the things needed with health/banking/transport/etc. to get things rolling. In the meantime my girlfriend did the same (we are not both from the same country), except for a different university &amp; campus and we're not living together due to external concerns.

While making this decision and getting ready for the new chapter in life, over and over I've been pointed out to the importance of networking - not sitting in my room when I can go out and meet people, get to know peers, have a good time - much off it frankly seems to boil down to partying, which has been more trouble for me than I anticipated.

I've gone to parties before so I have some limited prior experience. Here in London it's been two student social events and I think I've already had enough -- if there's music it's too loud, I don't drink alcohol due to playing it safe with prescription medicine I need to take to keep my mental health in check (and even so, seems alcohol only makes me more sleepy than talkative), I can hardly hear what the person next to me is saying, let alone getting to connect with them and know them. Picking up girls is out of question with me being in an exclusive, fully committed relationship with the girl I'm here with. Ultimately I don't think there is anything wrong whatsoever with being an extravert or enjoying dancing one's ass off or getting wasted, but for me the return of investment seems to be not so great - that spark, that connection with people just doesn't happen. So far I've not found a single person from my course; the closest I can get is someone else doing something computing-related, but it's usually pretty far off the mark. It's hard to find common ground with someone I just met 15 seconds ago with music so loud it numbs me out and us no idea of any overlapping interests.

The good news is that before the nightlife begins, it's pretty good. People so far have been super nice and friendly. I've been having a good time, good conversations, and am looking forward to meeting more of the folks from my exact course - hopefully the ones I can work with professionally at some point later down the line. It's just that the stuff with alcohol and meeting strangers doesn't work for expanding that network.

I've found that meet-ups or smaller events with some existing context (think workshops, guest lectures, stuff organized by a particular student society, meeting with acquaintances of friends, etc.) are so much better for me, and easier on my brain regarding the sheer mental load. I'm both and introvert and someone with ADHD, so there are times when brain completely shuts down from all the external stimuli at a louder event. So I've attended a few events outside the campus as well, mostly in the buzzing tech scene here an it's been rather good, even when alcohol is involved. It might be worth a mention I get very little financial support from my family, so I'm looking for part-time work opportunities in all this, as well as keeping mental health from crumbling due to the sheer amount of stress.

There's a lot of going on. On one hand, I'm trying to balance out making most out of the time here, on the other, sometimes not doing things and not going out to that event means more energy for working on a personal project or putting the extra effort into my next date with my girlfriend. I've been thinking that perhaps socializing for socializing's sake just doesn't make much sense to for me to begin with when I could invest it into time with loved ones, working/learning or building the network of my future career in the field.

So there's been some built-up frustration and some FOMO going on here - I would love to hear experiences, suggestions, advice; anything to validate the notion that I'm better off ignoring this aspect of college life or write it off - has it worked out for anyone here? Has it *not* worked out?

This is after having failed out of a 4 year uni almost 3 years ago when I suffered a rather major mental breakdown.

I grew up poor/middle class. I have divorced parents, one who was very much poor(no shoes/drink water when you're hungry because there's no food in the house) and one who managed to keep their head above the water even though it meant not really being there for birthday's and such(hard for a kid to understand at the time, much appreciated now). 

I say this because I am doing okay right now, but live in fear of being poor again. I know how to survive without heat/a/c, I know how to survive with very little food. I am grateful for these skills, but terrified of needing to rely on them.

This translates to me frequently looking to high paying positions and paths to getting there, deciding that's what I'm going to do, and then curling up a week later and sobbing at the idea of doing work I hate. Then I start brainstorming jobs that I'd like(practically all of them are creative-type jobs), paths to be successful in those careers...then curling up a week later and sobbing at the idea of failing and being poor. Cycle repeats. 

I do not like my job. I am good at my job. I was just promoted to T2, and I could probably be looking at a management position next year. I work for a great company, they really care about their employees. Great benefits, including tuition reimbursement. I just can't see myself doing this job 20 years down the line without being a miserable alcoholic or something.

I'm really not sure what I'm looking for here, advice, I guess. Has anyone else gone through these feelings; if so, how did you work through it and find a path that you felt good about?

Relevant Info: 
I am fairly good with computers/very good with people. I excel in customer support/internal support because I can connect with people very easily. (Ironically, I hate support positions.)

I am a writer. Amateur, admittedly. I love creative writing and have written two novels, and several short stories. I am not published.
Obviously, the Dream is to be an author, writing one or two books a year and relaxing in the Caribbean. (Yes, I'm being hyperbolic. No, I do not think this is a reasonable goal to attain next year or something otherwise ridiculous.)
I think I would enjoy working in media. I really want to affect social change and stimulate challenging thoughts. I'm not sure exactly what a position therein would look like. I also (theoretically) enjoy Anthropology. I enjoy studying people and learning about why different cultures do things a particular way, or even just why a group of people does X thing.

Ofcourse some (in that 21.7%) have almost finished the HW including some with below average score on the first exam. I am very happy to see that. But I have lost my motivation to ""work ON the masses"" (it's a pun).
 
I have several things with you to share, several emails from you folks. Sadly I'vent had the time to reply to them properly but I'll do so someday.
 
But one email asked me a question and I think an earlier answer to that might have helped some.
 
The situation is something like this -- Last weekend the person returned from their weekend trip to home and emailed me on late Sunday night --
 
""Is it true that the HW is due in 3 days""?
 
Answer: Yes. But it was not due FOR 3 days. HW could end up being due in an hour, if you start it with 1 hour to go.
 
Folks, I spent my entire lecture on Day 1 telling you what to do and not to do, to succeed in this class. I told you weekend is not your party time; not the least in your first semester. If your friends, parents, whoever you are 'hanging out' over the weekend are not asking you whether you are on board with your assignments in your first semester, they are distracting you. If they truly care for you and don't want to see you break down next semester when you will fail to get into your desired major, then they should work to stop distracting you and YOU should work to stop getting distracted. If you want to do well, then watch out. It is one thing to go home but another thing to take that time 'off' from serious catching up.
 
It is appalling enough that I had to spend one full 75 minutes preparing you how to study in college. Your teachers in school and your parents should have done that and not 'let you loose' with that irritating 'do what you want' message leaving you wandering aimlessly not knowing how to cope with college.
 
What is worse is that they and your new found friends are continuing to distract you. I bet even now they are telling you something like 'All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy'....to conclude what? Let's play, to hell with work? Let me tell you that ""All work and No play"" does NOT mean let's do all play and no work. Get your English right.
 
They (and you) need to change that to 'All Play and No Work Gets Jack a Dull Career'. Strike a balance. Extreme actions lead to catastrophe.
 
Few days back I met one of you who has badly failed (not just a low score, but badly failed) one of the easiest 218 exams. We spoke at length for quite sometime on what changes to bring about. Other issues aside, I asked if they go to these games.
 
Me: What time do you stop studying on Saturday?
They: Around 12:30pm Sat
Me: When do you start studying again?
They: around 2:30 pm on Sunday
Give or take a few hours but a good chunk of 24 hrs is wasted.
 
Thereafter they asked 'Can I please go to the BAMA game?' Why? Their parents are coming! I would have felt a lot happier if their parents had asked how much they scored on their first midterms (all classes) and mentored them on how to study (another example of a parent is coming below). Instead, how about waste another 24 hours for a 3 hour game that has an actual run time of 1 hour...Sigh. I feel sad for some of you.
 
Let me tell you that this student has not done a SINGLE HW problem (not even a practice one) from the current HW. I hope they will let their parents know their score on the 2nd midterm and get a pat on the back as well.
 
And ofcourse this person isn't the only one. I met a few others last week, who despite our chat has not done a SINGLE HW problem but I am sure had enough time to spend at 'the game'.
 
Another parent: Last semester I met one of my former students (she got an A in my class and at this point of our meeting she is NOT in my class) in the main floor. It was 8pm. She had brought her parents into the building to show them around campus. She introduced me to her parents. We had a nice chat and then she tells me this:
 
""Professor, my parents have come in to town for the game tomorrow and has even bought tickets for me. I am unable to convince them why I should not be going to this game cause I have a midterm on Monday"".
 
This is how BAD some parents are. But at the same time, this is also the spirit a real ""A"" has. You need to develop an attitude like hers. Learn to resist temptation, take responsibility of your actions and your life and pay heed when a professor (likely the only professor) sends you mails like these. Pinch yourself nice and hard and wake up from your dream world. Real world is different.
 
Want to watch the game? Who says no? I ddin't. Turn on that TV and watch it for 3 hours. Then go back to studying. You can't waste your weekend on one stupid game be it whatever game.
 
I told you on day 1, this class needs 17 hours of your time PER week for the average student to get an average grade. Not to get your A. If you ignored it, don't cry later. If you are going to take your weekends 'off' then find those 17 hours on the other 5 weekdays just for this class. i.e. 3.5 hours per weekday just for this class. Can't fit so many hours per day on weekdays? Then don't take your weekends off. Sleep, rest, listen to relaxing music and study if you want to get into your desired major.
 
Throw away all your enrollments in this organization, that organziation, this fraternity, that sorority, VP of this, CEO of that. No body will give a damn to any of these if you don't get into your major. 'Extra curricular' means extra to a GOOD curricular achievement. Fix the later first. There is plenty of time in your undergraduate career for all your 'extra' things. Does it have to be in your first semester when you are trying to learn how to cope with pressure and classes and homeowork?
 
For the last time, once again -- Getting into these majors is fiercely competitve. More challenging than going to Hell. Students have been denied application (let alone admission) because they fell short by a GPA of 0.04 (I know one case personally). Good luck to you!
 
Lastly, this mail is my last mail of concern to you. I am not 'mad at you' because you haven't started the HW. I won't be mad at you either if you don't do the HW. Do or don't, ace the exams and make sure you have enough points on other things to get your grade. But let me tell you this -- you can get 90% on midterms yet miss the A, because you will perform miserably on my final exam if you don't do my homework and practice problems.
 
It is upto you, how you would achieve your targets. Its your life, your career and will soon be your increasing debt as you end up delaying your graduation. Make sure to save your Aggie tickets and your A+ passes so that you can place them as stickers on your debt portfolio. Afterall, you should be able to connect the right 'cause' to the observed 'effect'.
 
Let the test average on exam 2 be 30. I promise you one thing, I won't curve it even if every other professor curves. I am not going to tell you 'its ok if you got 30, let's just call it 50'. No, you get 30, you are living with it. If in the real world, after you mess up at work if your boss could come to you and say 'I'm sorry you messed up, how about I give you a raise?"" then maybe such an expectation would make sense. But such doesn't happen and so the very thought of making a 30 a 50 hurts my brain. I am not doing it.
 
 
All the best to all of you. I've had enough 'Brain Damage'.

86,[deleted],1433479050,/r/college/comments/38mkhe/i_just_finished_my_first_year_in_college_and_i/,"I just finished my freshman year at my University. Things were going great during the first semester, never better actually. But after going through my second semester, I really can't but think of negative thoughts and be possessed by depression. Before I get to my story, some might say I am ok or why not talk to my family or friends, its just that my family never wants to talk: I have three older brothers. The one right above me in age dropped out in high school and does nothing but make fun of me most of the times. My oldest brother actually goes to a university much more known than me and he is near getting his master's degree in bio-med engineering; He never takes me seriously and forces himself to listen to me and always ends up telling me to ""figure it out on my own."" My parents never before in my life asked me about my grades. I am a very responsible person and they always believe that I will do my best and that I will do well. My friends are the type who really cannot connect emotionally with others that are hurt; they just arent the talking to type.

This is my story: 
I was born in the U.S. Up to the age of 10 (fourth grade) I was not good in school (C's mostly). I then moved to my country (Palestine). Here, I learned a new language and went to a school that was pure arabic language. I did not know how to write or read so it was challenging, but I worked harder than ever. 5th grade, my average was 78 (no such thing as gpa there). 6th grade, average was 85, 7th grade, my average was 93 and I was third in my class. 8th, 9th, and 10th grade, my average was 96 and I was first in my class at the time. I couldn't have been happier. 

I moved back to the U.S and attended high School for 11th and 12th grade tackling some AP courses and attaining a 4.0 gpa both years. I applied to a University and got in.

Its the first semester in college, obviously I was too nervous. I am a student majoring in chemistry to pursue a career in dentistry (Always loved chemistry deeply with my heart). The first semester was challenging indeed but rewarding. I was able to get a gpa of 3.91 (I was taking 4 courses and one lab. I received A's in all of my classes and only a single A- in my English course. The courses were Calculus 1, General chemistry 1 and lab, English 1, and a general education course). I couldnt have been any more happier in my life. One of the most memorable accomplishments of mine during this semester was with my first exam in college: it was a chemistry exam. Out of my lecture of 350 students, my professor pointed out that one student received a perfect score, and that student was me. That day gave me the confidence I needed to move on and press forward. I have never been happier, really I enjoyed my winter break with to my heart's content because I deserved it.

Then my second semester started, Something about this semester was just totally off. I felt like I was going to do bad somehow. The courses I took this semester were the following: Calculus 2, General Chemistry 2, English 2, Biology 1, Bio lab and chem lab. My biggest concern was biology. I simply suck at biology and the rumors about biology one at my university were brutal (30% pass rate, horrible department, bad professors, disorganized, weed out course). I didnt believe any of them but they were all true. To begin with, my first chemistry exam the second semester got me a 89/100. This put me down way too much because I expected more of what happened the first semester honestly. But this worry became nothing when i started biology. The course was horrible and disgusting in every way, especially the lab. It was the worst experience ever. No matter how much I tried in that course, I could never get things right. My first exam was a 66 (this was the first exam I ever failed.) My second exam was a 79 and final was 71. I couldnt get myself to do well in this course no matter how much I tried. I spoke with the professor a lot for advice but to no avail. I am a mathy person; chemistry and calculus were natural to me but biology was just hell. What made it worse is that all my friends were doing well and I was the only one behind. Furthermore, I always hated the fact how I could help others with things like math because math is a process, but I didnt know how to get help in biology. I was the only chemistry major in my entire biology lecture and it was just devastating to see my end result. 

In the end of this semester, I got a B- in biology and an A- in English 2. I have to admit, my grades came out midnight and I was literally heartbroken. My gpa was 3.58 for the semester ((was knocked off of deans list). I was the friend who was the ""smart"" one everyone believed in and everyone always told me not to worry because Im smart and all. But I always told them I am not. Although I should be happy, it really hurt to see all my friends do better than me this semester. 2 of my friends didnt take biology and ended up with 3.9 gpas. Two other friends who took biology and similar courses to me ended up with 3.3 and 3.65 gpas. It was extremely hard for me to bring up my grades to them. 

After getting such a low gpa, I feel as though the career I intend to pursue in dentistry is just fading away. I currently have a 3.74 gpa and I have a bad feeling it is going to get lower because classes are just getting harder. It really hurts me that I have no one to talk to, and I never got a gpa below 3.8. people tell me that gpas go up just as easy as they go down, but that is no where near true after doing some calculations. I had this big fear when I entered college, that something like this would happen. I told myself I must focus on getting a high gpa to start with so that it becomes too heavy to bring down later on. But now, I feel like I am going no where. 

To top things all off, I was late applying for volunteer opportunities and community service events involving dentistry to get my hours in because I am inexperienced with volunteer work, making me not so worthy of a future applicant. When I tried to shadow/volunteer at my local dentists, I was turned down because they have new trainees. 

I just wish there was something to put me back on my feet. This semester's gpa just brought me down too much. I have no more desire to eat as much, I can't sleep, and just thinking of my friends who are better off than me and knowing things are getting tougher later on are just making things worse. The biggest thing I am known for all around my friends, peers and teachers, is that I am the most hardworking student they have ever met. I consider this the only smart part about me. But what kills me is when people tell m I deserve this break, because I feel I really don't.

I am extremely sorry for the long post. I just wanted to let it all out and have something to say to someone willing to listen. Thank you so much.

87,MB123F,1429140238,/r/college/comments/32qr7m/end_of_freshman_year_and_i_still_feel_alone_here/,"Hey guys. I go to a small rural college far away from home and I'm not doing too well. I have only three people that I feel confident texting to get dinner or anything- I mostly just eat in my room. I'm involved in five clubs and I am going to be an orientation leader. Because of this yes, I know a lot of people that I can say hi to on the quad, but no one ever asks to hang out. I saw a counselor and was depressed in middle school and a little bit of hs and I thought I had it handled, but I had never been more depressed as I was my first semester.  It's not as bad now but it still creeps up on me a lot. I'd say 99% of the time I ask people to do stuff with me and 50% of the time I get a no. The school I go to is really cliquey because of the small size and I try really hard to find a group I fit in with or just people that I connect with and I have failed to do this. I had a really tight group of friends in high school so it's really hard to face the fact that I am practically alone here. I don't know why- I dress nicely and do my hair. I like to party but people rarely ask me to go. I always act friendly towards everyone, I even got accepted to be an orientation leader (still a surprise), which is really competitive. I feel like such a loser here and I don't understand why I have failed at forming successful friendships.

On the bright side, I only have one more year on this campus, one semester of which I plan to study abroad because I hate it here so much (I was going to later but I pushed it up a year because of this), and junior year I move to the larger campus. I plan on rushing next fall for the service frat there or a sorority there and just take the shuttle over when I have to.

TL;DR Freshman year has flown by and I still have no friends. Has this happened to anyone else? Does it get better? Or do I just have to wait it out?",college,End of Freshman Year and I Still Feel Alone Here,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/32qr7m/end_of_freshman_year_and_i_still_feel_alone_here/,1429158238.0
88,[deleted],1422043039,/r/college/comments/2tfq4u/rearranging_my_life_advice_wantedemployment/,"So some background info about myself before I explain my situation. I graduated high school May 2014. I began a relationship with a girl a year prior and by the time I graduated, I centered my entire life around her. Pushed away all my friends, quit a job because she didn't like my coworkers (they were all my friends), agreed to take all online classes in college because she was paranoid about me attending a college without her presence (she's still in high school). Pretty scummy stuff, I admit. So I decided to live at home, and I found a part-time job about 22 miles away. I did fairly well in my online classes, finished 15 credits with a 3.0 GPA last semester, which was outstanding considering the amount of time my relationship was taking up. 

I finally ended the relationship over the holidays, so it's been a few weeks, and I'm finally starting to open up to the world and get my life together. Another important note, I currently live in a rural area about 25 miles from my college, and my part time job is located 22 miles from my house but in the opposite direction. My goal is to live completely car free by the time next semester starts, preferably on my own. Living with my dad is manageable but not desirable, he has a hard time holding a job and paying bills, and my computer doesn't connect to the internet here so I'm stuck using his iPad during the day or going to overpriced coffee shops and McDonald's for wifi. I'd also like to have some group of friends by next semester, I'm skeptical about contacting my high school friends again, even if they aren't completely uninterested me they might live far away by now anyway. I'm naturally an introvert so that goal will be extra difficult for me. That being said, a good portion of my high school graduating class lives and goes to school in the same city my school is located in, it has one large state university along with a handful of community and tech colleges so it's a typical college town. 

I actually enjoy the online classes and being able to create my own schedule,the few times I've been to the actual campus were all very dull and boring, the place looks like a massive high school and I typically run in to a few random people from my graduating class. I don't do very well in the ""institutional"" setting, which I feel is one reason I did so poorly in high school. I'm only taking my general classes as of right now but I really feel like I'm learning something compared to high school, which was all about memorization and passing for me. I'm really sick of my part time job, I haven't made any friends in the 8 months I've worked there, whether that's my fault or not I'm not positive. Also, I'm currently completing my AA degree with the intention on transferring to the state university previously mentioned for my bachelors degree in urban planning. So my plan as follows:

Quit my far away, dead end part time job for a much closer (&gt;5 miles) full time shift job. 8 hours of work, 8 hours of sleep, leaves me with realistically 6-7 hours of work time each day, with the ability to catch up on the weekends as well. Do this till the end of the semester, save up a bunch of cash, then move out during the summer and live frugally as a student, probably live as a roommate and hold a part time job somewhere. Bike/walk/skate everywhere, if I need to take one or two classes on campus I can take public transportation (free for students), which I can also use for other transportation reasons. Continue this till I complete my four years, get my degree and start a fulfilling career while paying off my debt.

My courses this semester-macroeconomics, environmental economics, multicultural literature, interpersonal communication, diversity and social justice. I'm fairly organized in my schooling, I managed 15 credits last semester but I've never taken any similar classes this semester. So my question is, am I getting in over my head? Should I wait a little bit before I dive into a full time job? Maybe keep a part time? Or better yet, indebt myself for life and use loans to pay for everything and just focus on school? I'm basically just waiting until I can pass a drug test before I apply anywhere-I smoke weed when I'm not busy with school-so I have about a week left before I'm confident in applying anywhere. I don't normally pour a story out onto the internet but, my student loans haven't been posted to my bank account so I have a few hours to kill before I work and I'm looking for some advice beyond ""Oh yeah, you could do that too,"" which is usually what I hear from my coworkers or family members. So any advice or feedback would be great, if I'm missing any details I'm sure I could come up with them.
