Of course, when I first opened my admission letter I was ecstatic. It was one of the happiest moments of my life. But now that I'm here, I feel like a mistake. It's not imposter syndrome if I really am an imposter. I literally don't belong here.

I have social anxiety and have always been known as the quiet kid. I'm very, very shy. I had a 4.0 GPA in HS and high test scores, but was severely lacking in extracurriculars because I do not function well in social/group/team environments. I had a few small volunteering positions and club memberships and a summer part-time job, but zero leadership positions, no research or even awards, which all are all things top universities look for when admitting students. Universities like this don't accept shy people who won't contribute to their community.

I looked at the linkedin accounts of some of the people in my class and they have absolutely stunning ECs. I know someone who has literally written a novel, sold on amazon. These people have been involved in cancer research and started entire nonprofit organizations. They have blogs and youtube channels. They won national debate competitions and led climate protests. I'm not just talking about a few people here. Literally *everyone* has outstanding activities and leadership like this.

Then there's me, who is still afraid to raise my hand in a class of 15 people. How did I end up here, with all these brilliant, out-spoken students? I am nothing like them. I haven't made a single friend because I don't know how to hold up a 1 minute conversation. I haven't joined any clubs either. I haven't contributed anything meaningful to the community here and I don't even know how to. Why did they take me?

I don't know who to talk to about this. I want to reach out to my school's mental health counselors but I know they'll look at me with puzzled eyes and think, ""how did she get here in the first place?"" Schools like this don't take people with social anxiety.

I'm super, super super lucky to be here, and I'm extremely grateful, of course. But I know I was a mistake. I just want to cry and I feel so alienated from everyone. I feel like a failure and disappointment to this school knowing that I'm basically a useless acceptance.

1,icedchailattelover,1662349847,/r/college/comments/x665sh/im_so_homesick_and_not_settling_in_well/,"It’s ironic because I was so ready to move away for college and told everyone that would listen about how I wouldn’t miss my home state at all and that I was sick of it and ready for something new.

I moved in 2 weeks ago, and it has been extremely tough. I’m more introverted and all of my roommates are very loud and outgoing and even though I’m trying to be more extroverted and comfortable with them I can’t seem to get past just a polite relationship with them. I have to share a room for the first time in my life and it’s really uncomfortable for me. I really value time to myself to just be alone and relax and I have none of that here. It’s gotten to the point where I will just sit in my car on my phone so that I can be alone for a bit, which I’m aware is a really sad way to start off college. I’m suffering from so much social anxiety that I didn’t even know I had, maybe because I never had to make friends with strangers, all my friends I knew before were people I grew up with and was always comfortable with.

Last weekend I woke up and stared at the ceiling and started crying and just wanted to go home, so I spontaneously got on a flight home for the weekend. This weekend I did it again because I just couldn’t stand to be there and now I’m home right now and my flight back to school is tomorrow and I’m dreading it so much.

I don’t want to drop out and move back home because that would be so embarrassing since my entire family made such a big deal about me leaving for college and how proud they were. I could never just come back with my tail between my legs. But it is so so so hard, so much more than I ever expected. I had no idea I would feel like this. I miss having my own room, I miss my dog, I miss hanging out with my family everyday, I miss feeling like I’m where I belong. I hate feeling alone.

2,rafsimonsbigtoe,1652321200,/r/college/comments/unq2l6/taking_a_semester_off_and_transferring_my_story/," 

Hello all. This is my first time ever making a reddit post but I've been wanting to do this ever since I made this decision months ago. This is going to be super long, so I apologize. Hope you enjoy and resonate with something.

Going into college, I was pretty clueless on where to go and what I wanted to study (like most 17/18 yr olds). I had always valued academics and so did my family, my ACT was a 29 and I had a 4.0, so I knew I was able to get into most schools. I grew up in an extremely boring small town in Ohio and I knew I wanted to go out of state, but that was it. I applied to schools in Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, California, Connecticut, etc. All over the place. I found a university in central Florida, and I was intrigued. Their application was easy, and I got in. The school is known for giving out good financial aid to its students, and this was true. I got a good scholarship with grants to help alleviate the absurd ticket price of tuition and board there. So I decided to say fuck it I choose to go there, without even visiting the campus (I tried several times to see the school, but I was never able to because of conflicting events). Florida; beaches, palm trees, good weather, and it was consistently ranked one of the most beautiful schools in the nation. What could possibly go wrong?

At first I really liked it. My freshman year started Fall 2019. Everything was so new to me, and I had no issues making friends and meeting people. I was adjusting to classes well and really had no issues. Hell, when I went home for breaks I couldn't wait to get back. But as time progressed, I found myself thinking about transferring from time to time. I had told myself that the only school I would ever consider going to in Ohio was Ohio State. I really liked Columbus and I loved being in a city.

Fast forward to the end of freshman year, it was cut short by c\*vid and I was super sad and couldn't wait to get back to school and Florida as a whole. Boy was I wrong. I had a terrible Fall '20 semester. I did great academically but my social life had plummeted and I got really depressed. I would leave to go to class, come back to my apartment and see my roommate, but that was pretty much it. I had other close friends I would hang out with, and I went to the gym frequently, but it was overall a terrible semester, mostly due to the college making terrible decisions navigating through the pandemic. I felt so alone all the time. I felt like I never met anyone new and doing anything I enjoyed was hard to come by. So my thoughts of transferring started to increase a lot.

The next semester (Spring '21) went much better. Things were more normal and I met a lot more people, one of them becoming a best friend to me. I even met a girl halfway through the semester and we really hit it off. I wasn't looking for a girlfriend at the time, but I could tell she was worth it, we had a bunch of things in common, and we meshed super well. I had applied to some schools to transfer in the fall, but my advisor and close family advised against it because I was already half way done. So I decided to stick it out and stay another semester.

Fall '21 semester was interesting. Things with my girlfriend were going so great, classes were going good, I had good friends, but progressively my mental health began to drop. Going to a small university in Florida where the general popularity of undergrads were Greek Life or athletes, I felt insignificant and like I did not matter being a regular student. A lot of my friends were athletes (including my girlfriend) but I still felt like I didn't belong. I never really found a group of friends with similar interests and it honestly sucked. I would go home and visit my family and friends, and every time my breaks ended I did not want to go back to Florida. Eventually it got to a point where I broke down to my girlfriend midway through the semester and told her I didn't know how much longer I could stay at the school. It took a lot of courage and I did not know how to tell her. The point is, I was not happy there no matter how hard I tried. All I did was think about how I didn't belong there and that I wished I transferred somewhere else. I was able to recover a bit mentally, get through finals and everything, and flew back home to Ohio for winter break.

I had an incredible winter break back home. I spent a lot of time with my OSU friends and my friend group I usually hung out with, along with my family too. I DREADED going back, and it seemed time was just melting away. A few days before I was supposed to fly back home, I broke down completely to my mom. I didn't know what to do, and I was running out of time to think about my options. I knew that if I did another semester at my school there would have been no point to transfer for my senior year. I would practically be almost done. So I ran the idea of taking the semester off by her and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Taking the semester off would give me ample time to figure out what I wanted to do. I called my girlfriend that night and told her that I was considering taking the semester off, and we couldn't stop crying. She told me she didn't want me to leave her. I was still really on the fence about things.

I was a mess. My dad dropped me off at the airport and I hugged him for the longest time and cried to him telling him I didn't want to leave. The entire time on the flight I remember thinking how if the plane were to crash at that moment, I would not have cared. I ubered back to my apartment from the airport, and went straight to my bed. I didn't eat, and I couldn't get myself to get out of bed. It was like this for a few days. I was running out of time. The semester was starting soon and in order to get a full refund on tuition and everything I needed to decide really fucking quickly. I talked to my parents and older sister on the phone. I sobbed in front of my girlfriend as I talked with her about things. I loved my girlfriend so fucking much but I knew I had to leave. I knew if I had stayed for this semester, I would have only been staying because I didn't want to leave her, and I felt like that was not fair for myself and well being. I knew I had to do this for **myself**. **I knew it was best for my situation and I didn't see the point of me spending thousands of dollars in tuition at this school again if I hated being there.** I went through with withdrawing from the school, packed everything in my car, and drove home to Ohio.

That is the story of me taking the semester off. It was the hardest decision I've ever made and man, it's been a rollercoaster the past four months. I've dealt with so many feelings. Some days I have felt that I have made the right decision for myself and other days I feel like a i'm a fucking idiot. Many times I have thought to myself ""You were so close to being done there, you couldn't stick it out for three more semesters?"" My girlfriend and I tried to do long distance, but we did not realize how difficult it would become. A lot happened the past four months. We got into a lot of disagreements. I even visited her for a week during her spring break and it was amazing to see her. She ended up breaking up with me a week and a half ago and I can't help but to feel at fault. I know this would not have happened if I had not have left. Things were so amazing with her but I ruined it because I had to leave. I took a big risk making this decision for myself and this I guess this was a repercussion of that decision.

**At the end of the day, you gotta do what's best for yourself and your well being.** I knew I was not okay mentally and I made a big change. It's been really hard and I've been dragged through the mud the past two weeks. I am set to transfer to Ohio State in the fall to finish my last year. I know things will get better soon, It's just been tough seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I've been through a lot over the past four months.

That is almost everything. Or at least the best possible way I could say things to an audience who has no context of my life. I cried typing this and put a lot effort into it. Anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this, just know I am so appreciative of you hearing me out.

3,snapper3071,1651995691,/r/college/comments/ukwqte/feeling_really_disappointed_with_my_performance/,"I will likely end up with around a cumulative 2.9 at the end of this semester and I feel like I've just screwed up my future. I'm a non premed bio major, but I hope to one day get a Phd so I'm still really motivated and want to achieve so much in life. However, even if I were to get all 4.0s from now on (which I won't if I'm going to be honest), I will end up with a gpa around 3.5, which will still not get me into grad school and I will likely not be finding any stable jobs in the future. So safe to say, I'm really worried. 

I had a really hard time adjusting to being oos at a huge state school that I have zero clue how I got into and genuinely don't believe I belong in anymore. (TW) I also really struggled heavily with my mental health and came close to wanting to take the easy way out twice last semester. Being relatively smart was really the only thing I had going for me in life, so when that piece of my identity was taken away, I just felt really empty. I genuinely felt like there was zero point to it all. I tried so hard and go so little in return. It got really tough at the end of each semester when everyone and their moms were yelling about their 4.0s and paid internships and I couldn't cheer about really anything. It sucked. 

Also, not only did I skip out on getting good grades, I also skipped out on making friends and joining orgs. I now wish I had that support system or retreat space more than ever. I might be more mad at myself for that than anything else tbh. I've never felt more alone even though I'm surrounded by 40,000 people.

4,TheFriendlyAmoeba,1647975326,/r/college/comments/tka74n/handling_imposter_syndrome_and_mentors/,"TLDR: First generation, non-white passing student returning to school. Had a chat with a would be ""mentor."" Her  advice was based on generalizations and would not listen to my input. Now, her words have me  reconsidering everything as whether I am worthy of a degree in any major.

I left college due to many reasons: imposter syndrome, dislike of major, finances, lack of opportunity, unfair treatment, and being called not professional. It's a bit of a long story. The school I went to prided itself on being the most diverse campus in the state. However, I felt like I did not belong in the program. Everyone around me kept talking about the internships they were doing/have done; conferences they attended; events the were invited too, connections/mentors they knew and had (family and friends); businesses they started; and how the school administration nominated/selected them for outside opportunities as well as help them. Meanwhile, these same administrators, were the ones to be short with me and to dismiss me while giving others time and opportunity.  

 I did not yell, use profanity/slang, or act rude but for some reason I was called not/not coming off as professional by the administrators and some internship interviews. I was never given any solid advice other than be more professional, but I feel as though people judge me by my outward appearance and put me in a certain category. I do not feel that school/work is the proper setting to be vulnerable and open up about my personal life. I also feel like first-generation POC have to put on a whole ""show/performance"" to prove to others that they are worthy while other's do not have to. 

 I decided that this probably was not the area of study for me,. Recently, I went back to school to pursue a degree in a different field. I was able to get a mentor, and she connected me to others so that they may help me. However, one of them made me reconsider EVERYTHING, and my life choices.  

 For starters, we are of similar background. She said I would have to give up EVERYTHING, dedicate my life to the field, and not pursue any other aspirations because I decided to take this ""journey."" That I must be  a role model to be happy, meaning a higher up; such as a  VP, President, , manager, supervisor, director, CEO etc of a company. Otherwise I am replaceable, and to not consider the field if I do not want to be in those positions .   I must have credibility so that someone consider me a role model, otherwise I will not be happy in my major/career. She also mentioned her credibility: having many degrees, working  in the field, teaching courses relative courses,  going to ivy league school for graduate studies, published papers. 

&amp;#x200B;

 To me, being a role model could literally mean anything to anyone and I should not drive myself crazy if someone doesn't consider me as such. I should pursue something because it is of interest to me rather than pursue something for people's validation. If someone comes to me with questions, of course I will guide them but being a role model (by her definition) is not my top priority over my survival, health, and mental well-being. She was not happy with this as my  response. 

&amp;#x200B;

 She also said my previous classes would be a sunk cost, and to just complete the previous degree of study and get an MBA in management . Since most people in the field get an MBA regardless. She told me to go for HR, because it is an easy job, anyone will hire me,  does not require a degree, I cannot be replaced, and people management is a valuable skill. However, no one would hire me with no experience for internships never mind a job itself no matter how well I draw on previous experience. If no one is replaceable how would you expect me to get a job?

 

When I explained to her my previous experience and struggle, she just told me those worries don't exist and to ignore them and ignore my experiences. When I told her I would get deemed unprofessional for standing my group and prove myself whereas others don't , she told me I don't have the experience in the field for them to consider me as such. When in fact, she saw my resume of having over 3+ years of experience. 

Though I did tell her it was some form of racism, she told me that ""other POC in the corporate world get treated like that. What do you think the  people who work there do? They just ignore it/deal with it"" and that any should ignore

 

When she asked me when I left my older school, I said (at the time) 3 years ago. She was shocked saying it has been a while and thought I left recently. She said time is against me. I don't know why she would say that to me or anybody, since you wouldn't say that to someone trying to get into/going through  medical school, pharmacy, school, law school, or even graduate school like herself. 

She  asked me which high school I went to, and told me it was due to my socioeconomic background  that I am ""not professional"". I had no control over this, and I highly doubt it matters. I never put my address on my resume. Well, she pretty much negated herself anyway. 

Now that I am in school, I keep thinking about her words. My peers either have time working/experience  in the industry. Some also have family connections. I can't help but consider these as my failures and shortcomings and ever pursuing the field. Sometimes, I question whether I am worthy of pursuing any degree.",college,Handling Imposter Syndrome and Mentors,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tka74n/handling_imposter_syndrome_and_mentors/,1647993326.0
5,okayshark,1647359489,/r/college/comments/tes33g/physics_biology_dilemma_on_whether_i_should/,"TLDR is at the bottom as well as my questions. This turned out very long, I apologize.

To start out i would like to say this: I love physics, ever since i was in elementary school i've loved physics phenomena, lasers, optics and had marvelled at the fact that we can explain so much about the universe. I took physics as one of my Leistungskurse (elevated courses with more hours in German high schools), did my hs graduation exam in it and finished with an excellent score. I really did enjoy it all the way and our teacher was super chill and supportive, in general all my physics teachers were very cool and made our lessons fun with many very interesting experiments. It's a language that we can explore the universe in and that makes it very exciting.

So it's no wonder i went into university pretty determined on physics, however i didn't make my decision based on one specific job i wanted to do, but coming from a thirst for knowledge.

In high school, my strategy was to pay attention in lessons and thoroughly write everything down and take notes. I wasn't the kid that caught up to everything the teacher said in the lesson and when preparing for exams or revising I would sit and go through everything by myself. This was a very good method for me personally because i could understand the concepts and their connections in my own pace and understand things through my own methods. It might sound weird that the kid who was regarded as one of the top students sometimes couldn't have answered the most simple questions on a new topic, but that's how it was, i just needed the time.

But ever since the bridge courses before the semester i've been struggling. I'm told that it's normal for first years to feel like everyone around you knows everything and only you are behind, but after a semester the feeling is still strongly there. I will admit I have made many mistakes, like starting the more in-depth math courses from the beginning and not revising after every other class. As the workload was immense, I barely slept in the first two months. This in turn lead to me barely being able to stay awake in class and tutorials. I acknowledge these mistakes and have already made adjustments to lighten the load.

Now, as for uni, the sheer amount of stuff we have to learn, on our own, at my university -which might be a normal amount, given this is university- is a lot to approach with my method. We were advised to study in groups and do our weekly exercise sheets together, and though I had some moments of victory where I could do one exercise, mostly it consisted of the other students talking about the topic like they understood it really well while I sat there and listened for any coherent crumbs of info and sometimes asked for a tip on how to proceed. Admittedly this was not a good method and I found some people closer to my pace who I could study with, but they weren't always there or we ended up sitting with our sheets well into dusk. So by the time I got home I was tired and turned to my phone for an escape lot of the time. Now I know that delaying catching up with our topics is a bad strategy due to time and the amount of material. But it seems like it's good if i take the time to catch up and revise by myself, also because the way things are explained in class don't always work for me.

As for the social aspect of it, there wasn't really a time where I felt that I fit in or that I have much in common with anyone there except maybe when we were talking about art. I also found myself rethinking my choices a lot. I missed my friends and my family immensely and honestly struggled to feel human at times. I haven't really been able to find the motivation to study beyond the desire to get through another week.

When I look into what kind of scripts belong to classes in later semesters, the topics seem interesting, still it's pages of text with about the same amount of equations which i'm sure contain so much interesting and informative stuff.. Still right now that aspect of ""woah that's so cool"" is kind of missing. Maybe that will come later, i figure when we get to more stuff that's beyond mechanics.

I suspect I might also have ADHD and may be nd in other ways which i will get checked out with a professional if i am able to. So to be clear i'm not self diagnosing, but i'm constantly reading up on these subjects and honestly everything seems to make so much more sense.

So that's a little bit on how I have felt about my first semester of physics.

The thing is, beside physics, I'm also very interested in biology. Our university has a small biology faculty and it seems to be much cozier than 200-300 people in physics. The longer i've thought about it, the more i find myself interested in life and the parts of science that deal with living things. I took biology as a Basiskurs (a course that has less lessons and is more simplified compared to Leistungskurs) and I loved it. At school i've done several presentations in both physics and biology (and ethics) and I loved doing those, I find it's so much fun to research things and share them with others in a way that's engaging and comprehensive. I watch science videos and listen to podcasts in my free time as well, like Scishow (both vids and podcasts) and books like The Selfish Gene (that i found super interesting and recommend!!), and generally beside physics, a lot of them have a lot to do with biology. I find that these pieces of media don't overwhelm me and i want to know more about them, in general all kinds of stuff that have to do with life feel like tangible things to me and they kind of fall into place in the big scheme of things. I hope i phrased that in a way that's understandable.

I will implement new strategies in the coming semester and am in the process of hopefully getting a private tutor. I'm determined to go through my second semester in physics and reevaluate things after, but the way things are looking for me mentally right now, i think going with something that is naturally and directly engaging and has a sense of novelty and many little rewards that are directly applicable (so: biology) would lighten the load for now. Going into uni i talked with some advisors from both faculties on doing two bachelors, they said it was possible but i should rather wait. I would even consider doing them one after another with no overlap (of course i'd have to start working a job too eventually, to afford rent and basic expenses, right now i have a very amazing scholarship and mainly my parent's support paying for that)

The direction that would unite like, almost if not all of my interests well (given my current level of being informed) would be neuroscience. I think it's just in the sweet spot between big stuff and small stuff -ie. humans between particles and the universe and it has that direct application to life that i'm looking for as well as physics and biology. My dad is a surgeon and he has inspired me a lot to look into things that have to do with humans and with medicine, and when we learned about the brain in bio in hs i was always like ""heh i can't wait to learn more about this"". So far it's been the most definite career that i could see myself pursuing in the area of science. I want to help people and i want to feel like i am needed.  
I still wish to pursue physics, because i love it after all and I Want To Understand Those Things!!!!(tm) also the experience and learned methods are definitely very valuable and give good prospects. I know it will remain a passion. But maybe it could be better to do it when I have the resources, support system that i also have control over, and maturity to do so.

TLDR: first semester of physics was a lot to handle partly because of inexperience and partly because it's A Lot, took a toll on me mentally. Implementing new and improved strategy for second semester, will see how things turn out. However, also want to do biology at one point, maybe doing it earlier would benefit my mental wellbeing more? Would love to combine both in future job, not sure of the road to there though.

Question to you: Have you had any experiences like this? Is it worth it to keep pushing? Will things change?  
Also: if you have experience starting out in physics and then going into biology later (maybe even not from a bachelors, like from a masters with overlap in bio or a job) how is that road?

Thank you kindly if you read this far and if you have any questions i'd gladly answer, I know my points are a little bit all over the place.",college,"Physics, Biology: Dilemma on whether I should switch my major ft. mental health",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tes33g/physics_biology_dilemma_on_whether_i_should/,1647377489.0

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, so I'm a 26 year old undergrad, no n traditional path. Grew up with a lower middle class, very broken family, lots of issues.  I couldn't go to uni like a normal student at the normal time due to my mom loosing her job right before. I had to struggle through community college, dropping out, trade school, that not working out (graduated but no jobs due to no degree / experience), community college again with a plan to transfer to a uni.

During this, my family was dysfunctional and all I had to rely on were online friends.  I was constantly dealing with, what I thought was just, regular depression fueled burn out due to how much had fallen through, how much I had to deal with, but it turned out it was actually ADHD burn out.

Well, two of my online firends went to a uni they pushed me to apply to. I get in, and since it gave me the best finaid deal, I decided to go. To make a long story short after I got accepted, before I started going to the school, one of the friends kept treating opinions I held like they were objectively wrong and I would stand up for myself after this kept happening and she would back up like ""yikes"" like my agresssion came from no where. When I got to the school, this person just acted really cold like we hadn't been good friends for over a year.  The other friend seemed not really interested to hang out with me either, kept saying she was busy but talked about procrastinating and doing other things on Twitter.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I couldn't count on them, and I also found I struggled with CS and it's math. seeked out supports from fellow students, and the ones I talked to seemed to just tell me to ""Get gud or you'll keep failing"". 

I struggled to make friends at mass meetings due to everyone seeming to already have people to talk to, I talked to some and with few exceptions. I feel like an other and like I really do need to dissociate as no one here is all that relatable due to age / class gap (mostly rich kids). I live in a house for graduate students, who are easier to talk to. Point is, all of these things led to trauma. the friendship situation felt like a final straw as I was already used to being treated in ways where I was infantilized, talked over, deceived, gaslit, ostracized etc and I tried to believe things would get better . . .yet they didn't really, if it seemed like it did it all fell apart or didn't last long. 

I kept trying to tell people about my perspective on things, and they'd respond like ""how can you think that way, why are you like this?"" I finally one day explained that I went through more than most people, and I was just told it was weird to compare peoples' pasts. I kept getting talked over when I tried sharing how I felt. I was told I was wrong, or I'd get told ""I'm sorry that happened, but this is a weak argument compared to data"" When I tried to tell people how they made me feel, multiple times I got told ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" like they couldn't take any responsibility.

I honestly wish I. could transfer no matter who was wrong. It'd let me heal and sort where I was wrong vs where I wasn't and just understand the situation with given space, but that can't happen due to how fr I am in my degree. My school is big and I really am trying to, when I have time, meet people, but I rarely have the time / energy and I just feel subconciously discouraged to even try to meet people. There have been decent people but there are also people who have sat there and found excuses to invalidate my feelings rather than just say nothing, ""educate me on why what I said was wrong"" and when I broke down and had an over the top tantrum (Autistic meltdown, was still not OK by any means) on the uni's sub, I got people downplaying, being sarcastic, got told to stop projecting, got called mentally ill.

They are right, at least to a degree, I acknowledge that. I just feel like I really didn't belong here, and when I tried, very, very imperfectly , to make my own space , no one tried to really understand me to any degree and I just kinda feel like giving up to save myself. I just let myself go more than I usually did cause I think I'm just done. I feel like I might be gaslighted into thinking I'm a truly horrible person but I could just really be a horrible person.

TL;DR: not liking current OOS school (oregon state), it is expensive but money isn't a problem, **I don't see how it is justifiable spending all of that money if I am not enjoying my time here.** should i transfer to a csu i would commute from home to? a CC so i could get into a UC more easily? or directly to a UC from my school (would have to attend 2 years at my current OOS school)

Hello all,

So, to cut right to the chase, I am not enjoying my time very much at the current school I am attending. For details, I am a California resident, and I am attending Oregon State University as a freshman for an ECE degree, which means that I am paying OOS tuition. I did not enjoy my first fall quarter here, and while there are some more interesting classes I am taking right now for Winter Quarter, I still can't shake the feeling that I don't belong here. I haven't made that many friends, I haven't particularly liked any of my professors, and the one fun sport I did in high school, cross country, is not the same at all here (it just feels like a 'running buddy' club). On top of this, I have felt very homesick and have been very depressed. This might also be caused by the cloudy and rainy weather here in Oregon.

I got waitlisted and then rejected at UC Davis, but waitlisted and accepted at UC Santa Cruz. The reason I didn't pick UCSC was because of the housing crisis, and since I would need to get off-campus housing at one point, I decided it wouldn't be worth going there. However, at Oregon State, I haven't particularly enjoyed my time here so far.

So, I have a couple of options that I was hopeful to get this subreddit's opinion on.

One of the first options I have is to remain here at OSU. While I don't like it here yet, it is very possible that it could get better, but I am not sure how it would. I am still only taking general ed classes here, so it hasn't gotten very technical, but maybe when it does, I might enjoy it. However, I have been very homesick, missing my old friends (who stayed back in CA to save money), and I don't see my future here. I am also paying OOS tuition, which with some scholarships I received from the school, is about $40,000 a year. While money is not an issue for me, **I don't see how it is justifiable spending all of that money if I am not enjoying my time here.**

A second option that I have is to transfer to UC Davis while remaining here at Oregon State. I feel like this is the **safest option**, so that way in case I don't get accepted into UCD, I can still attend OSU for its program (which I heard is good for CS/ECE? Not sure, if someone could double check this I would be grateful). I am concerned that I won't get accepted into UCD, however, as I am transferring into an impacted program, CE or CSE (one of these I'm transferring into). I would also not fall under the protection of TAG (Transfer Admission Guarantee).

A third option I could do is to transfer to a CC, get with the TAG program, and then transfer to UC Davis. If I were to do this, I would wait until I completed all three quarters here at Oregon State, and then transfer to my local CC back home. However, I am not sure this is the best course of action, as I will have transferred a total of three times, and I'm not sure how that will look to the UCD admission officers, or to future employers. Also, since CSE and CE are very similar majors to Computer Science at UC Davis, it is possible that they could be taken off of the TAG list of majors, as CS was taken off due to the major being impacted. This way, however, I feel I would have the BEST chances at getting into UC Davis.

A fourth and final option would be to transfer back home to a CSU, which I would commute from home to. I am not sure how this option would go, but I think I would be limiting my potential, as CSUS is a lower ranked school (if that means anything), and it may impact my future endeavors. I would, however, be at home, and be attending the same school as some of my high school friends.

Please let me know your thoughts on this! I have been very lost for quite some time, and I feel like I have been going in circles, and I don't know what to do at this point.

However, the school was not my vibe at all. I'm more intellectual. I enjoy debating philosophical topics, talking about tv shows/books/movies and playing video games. The party culture in that city is big and I never felt like I belonged. I still desired to ""fit in"" so I thought I had to engage in it to be ""normal."" I didn't even get to have the dorm experience because I lived at home. While I did make friends, they were very different people than me. Still, it was either have them as friends or have no friends so I stuck with them. I felt terribly alone. My loneliness there led to further depression and I spent my time flunking courses and somehow graduating with a 2.1 GPA. This low GPA meant that I couldn't go study abroad and join certain extra curriculars.

At the time, I didn't have the self-respect and self-love to ask myself who I was and what I wanted. In retrospect, I should have applied to a different, nerdier school and taken out student loans to go there. I understand that I ""lucked out"" financially. But I paid a terrible price. I feel like I have stunted emotional growth. It's like I didn't develop properly. I see other people with the best friend groups that they feel they belong with. Meanwhile, I feel like I am cut from a different cloth as my college buddies. Don't get me wrong, I'm super grateful to have them in my life. But we are very different as people.

These days I have a good, 6-figure job and I am receiving help for my depression through medication and therapy. I am also more physically fit than I was in undergrad. But I yearn to replace those years of bad development with years of good development. I am contemplating going back to college for a second undergraduate degree. I want to go to a nerdier school up north. I'd like to join the debate team, be more involved in my studies, and make those friends who I feel are ""my type of people."" I'd like to study abroad for a semester. Does this all seem like a pipe dream of someone who needs to ""learn to let go?""

I’ve been depressed since middle school but I never tried to get help because well I just thought it was something that couldn’t be fixed. This depression though feels more extreme. 

I’m 20F and a junior in college yet I have not accomplished anything significant. I have transferred to 2 different schools because I kept switching majors and i’m slightly behind in my intended major. I was an average student in high school and I remember regretting not being more involved and studying more. To this day I regret not living my life as a real teenager and instead being a shut in with depression. 
I thought college would be better but I feel worse. I’ve joined many clubs and tried to befriend classmates to no avail. I feel like I don’t belong and I don’t look like majority of the people on campus. 

I feel extreme jealousy and yearning when I see friend groups and couples together on campus. I also get extremely jealous when I drive past greek row and see everyone partying and having fun.

I am taking Calculus 2 twice a week and I’ve legit never hated a class as much as this one, I actually despise it and it pisses me off. Throughout high school math was one of the subjects that just came naturally to me. My senior year I took AP calculus AB and I did really well. I got a 4 on the AP exam and finished with a 90 in the second semester. Can’t say the same about calc 2 so far. Every time I go to that damn class I go in there knowing I’m not gonna learn shit because the teacher goes so fast and expects us to have memorized all of the shit from calc 1 and anything before that. I feel like I don’t belong and it really brings my mood down. On top of that, he assigns a ton of homework. I kid you not we actually keep learning shit and then he gives us only one class period of review. The shit of the lessons that he goes through is basically just doing problems super fast while explaining it, we go through multiple lessons of the chapter in the same class periods btw. Then he assigns about 30 homework problems due the next week on the Monday (I take the classes Tuesdays and Thursdays). These “homework sessions don’t teach shit because you’re trying to get a good grade on them and they usually take me about 4 hours. I got a 62 on the first test and it’s only because the grading scale is curved as hell for exams. Anyways, one of my classmates mentioned last week to the whole class like “yo there’s 6 homeworks and a quiz due next week” which is this week aka exam 2 week. And the teacher’s response was “hoohoohoo, looks like you guys have a lot of math to do this weekend.” Are you shitting me man, what a freaking asshole. All of those are over 50 problems and they’re due the day before the exam. We can’t even ask about those homework problems because we don’t have class the day before the exam. How can you fucking expect anyone to do well on something that you’re not even giving them enough time to master. Sigh I should probably keep working on this shit.

12,WickedPuffin,1632516452,/r/college/comments/pus8ut/my_school_has_made_me_regret_my_time_here/,"So I’m in my last semester of school before graduating, but I feel so upset by my experience here. I’m a biology major at a pretty small school. I began my major with a good group of like-minded friends. I’m leaving with all of those friends having failed out of our major except me. I feel very alone and like I don’t belong here…

Right from the start, the professors have been downright disrespectful. I’m actually not sure I’ve ever met a more mean spirited group of people. They spend all their time in their labs doing research while the students have difficulty getting even the slightest bit of attention. I remember back to my freshman year where one belittled me to another student. I had heard this after I went to see if they were available to help me with my schedule. They were completely ignoring any messages and scheduling was coming up. So I went to find them. I looked in at their office and was asked to wait five minutes as he talked to a graduate student. This was perfectly fine until he decided to say how he hated people that looked at his office and that you should never do this. I then spent the next five minutes crying as he made fun of me to this random girl. The same Professor would make snide remarks about me, even saying “oh go crawl back into your hole” when he saw me walking to class. I’m guessing I wasn’t meant to hear this but I did. He has gone on to yell and scream at other students and even lesser professors for the most ridiculous things. 

Recently, I have taken to helping some of the other students in my major. One of whom is a transfer student. She had told me how she has had some difficulty getting in contact with this professor to talk about a class she needed. He had told her he wanted to add her to a class(one that he just added and wasn’t one she could add herself), but he hadn’t contacted her again after she asked where and when this class would take place, or even if he had added her. She tried contacting him over the next few days and he still didn’t answer her. Even going to his office(even though he HATES this)where he ignored her. She emailed her advisor to see if she could help. This got him to finally open his door and allow her in. This is where he decided he was going to talk to her like she was a moron and ask her what part of the class she didn’t understand…like WHAT? Why is he doing this? She just wanted to know simple info about the class as it HAD ALREADY STARTED. I don’t get how he could make someone feel so stupid for his own mistake. It’s like he’s incapable of apologizing or feeling shame.

I’m just so sick of this constant state of ignoring students and making them feel alone and unworthy of being here. They made this guy chair of our program btw so apparently his attitude is a small issue to them. And it’s not just this professor but others too. I wish I would’ve gone somewhere else where I could’ve made better relationships with my professors and had an overall better experience…",college,My school has made me regret my time here,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pus8ut/my_school_has_made_me_regret_my_time_here/,1632534452.0

It took me 5 1/2 years to finish community college as I was going part-time due to mental health reasons, and am now entering my 2nd year in engineering at SDSU. It took me a long time to graduate community college because I did not know what I wanted to do and followed conventional advice that any STEM major i pursue will make me lots of money (am somewhat passionate about math and scored well in calculus, physics, etc.), and I was insecure around my peers who went to better colleges than me and wanted to ""prove"" to them that I can go to a good college from CC and out-earn them, as well as the fact that I wanted to impress my dad since he's an engineer himself. However, not knowing what to do and depression/anxiety/mental illness meant several semesters of W's and C's/D's and applying to university to ""get out of community college"" after being there a long time; surprisingly, after getting a 3.5 GPA, I got into SDSU and decided to go there because of the traditional college experience. Then COVID hit and we were forced into online school, which I did well in with a 3.2 GPA. 

However, now that classes are in-person at my institution and me wanting to be a different person than the anxious/depressed self I was, I am questioning whether I belong in engineering. It is very hard, and by the way I learn, I am unsure if I can stick with a full course load since I like to take my time to understand the concepts and do problems from other books rather than just do the homework. Also, my attention span in class isn't that great and have a hard time paying attention in class with my learning disabilities. (By the way, I do have accommodations with extended time on exams and a note-taker and has helped me in classes, which have helped greatly)

Is my feeling of unsureness of why I'm in my major a normal feeling amongst college students? Should I seek help? My dad wants me to stick it out and told me that we all feel like this and if I stick in this state of unsureness, I will not graduate and move forward with my life.

I am not sure whether this qualifies as a valid post in this forum and in the case that it is not, moderators, please go ahead and remove it (I am also fairly new to Reddit) I am currently in my second year of college and with the new year starting soon, I have absolutely no idea of what I should do in this situation. I would really like some advice regarding this. 

A bit of background here. Back in high school, I was a straight-A student and graduated with a 4.0 GPA, 1580 SAT and 35 ACT with significant extracurriculars. I seemed to be good at whatever I did, I enjoyed every subject I studied and put my 100% into it. I willingly did all of the extra readings and I had a constant drive to learn beyond what was taught in class for every single subject. I was intrigued by STEM so I decided to pursue CS in college despite only having limited background knowledge in it. Eventually, I applied to a T5 school and got accepted - it seemed to be a dream come true (the school I got into is extremely selective (&lt;5%) for my course) 

Then Covid struck. After about 6 months of lockdowns, I started (online) college last fall. I was very excited since it was my dream school. However, 2 weeks into the semester, I was falling behind on almost every subject, including a math class which was essentially a recap of high school math. I started doubting whether STEM was even the right choice for me, or if I was too stupid for it in the first place. However, I dismissed this using covid as an excuse and that I was merely facing a bit of starting trouble. The semester came to a disappointing end with Bs and Cs in my classes. 

At that point, I still didn’t contemplate a change in major. I hoped that things would get better. However, in my second semester, things started well for the first 3 weeks or so and then got really bad and I ended up with straight Cs. 

Then summer happened. I really started contemplating a change in major because I really didn’t know what else to do. Everyone I asked regarding this, seemed to tell me that things would get better with time. I too believed that it would and the fact that I was extremely privileged to be studying a very competitive course in a T5 school further seemed to provide more reason for me to stick with the same major. I also somewhat attributed my grades to my inability to cope with the whole online learning. Moreover, I enrolled in a couple of online summer programmes, none of which I was able to complete - because I was unable to fully concentrate on them with my wavering mindset. 

Now that the next semester is going to start in a week or so, I am absolutely dreading going back to school. I don’t feel like I belong in this major or in this school anymore and I seem to have completely lost my desire to learn. My growth mindset is absolutely nonexistent at this point, and I’m already waiting for Christmas break. The worst part is that I even lack the motivation to do whatever I loved doing back in high school.

I... kind of want to do a whole 180 on my life right now. I'm currently enrolled as an Animal Science major, but I'm starting to learn that math and chemistry are really not my strong-suits and I don't think I would thrive well in this major. I've been telling people that I will ""try the major out"" because I do love working with animals and I enjoy biology. Is this a good idea if I'm almost 100% sure I want to switch my major? My biggest thing is I really do enjoy working with animals and if I just worked with animals as my job that would be great - but I know there's more to it than that and that makes me really reconsider.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I switched my major, I might have to go to a different college, and that terrifies me. I haven't even started at my original college (I will be a freshman this fall) and I'm terrified of getting attached and then having to leave and do the transition process all over again. I have a lot of mental health issues (anxiety being the big one) and neurological problems (autism comes to mind) and I am terrible with change and transition. It's dehabilitating even on medication and with frequent therapy. I'm really scared of having to do this, which makes me not want to change as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's the kicker: I'm thinking about going into screenwriting... I know, I know - I won't make any money doing this. But it's something I love and enjoy doing, and I'm really not that interested in any other types of filmmaking other than (possibly) producing or show-running. I don't really want to be on the recording/technical side of things because I'm not a big fan of working with cameras or equipment, but I'd love to be on the creative side of things. Is this a good decision, or should I learn to like... work with equipment? I did a TON of theatre in high school, so I'm not super great with film, but I love writing and I love being creative. Just not super technical and being on the technical side of film really scares me. I don't know if I want to do that kind of stuff, and I'm not sure if by going into ""film"" I'm setting myself up for doing that.

Now, for the pessimistic part: 

I don't think I can do it. I feel like I'm destined to be a nobody in the world, and that my life is going to be worthless. I feel like I'm a complete waste of space because I don't know what I want to do. I don't know if anyone else feels like this but it's suffocating.

I feel like it takes me 10x longer to figure out my assignments and learn the material than my fellow students. I feel like so much of the material goes way over my head and that I’m not qualified to be in the classes that I’m in. 

This gives me insane academic anxiety and I end up working on homework and seeking supplemental instruction from sun up until sun down. My whole life has become dedicated to school. I’ve made zero friends in two years because of this and the loneliness is catching up to me. 

And because I force myself to be a workaholic I end up getting really good grades. But at the end of the day I still end up feeling like a complete idiot and that I don’t belong in this major. I feel almost guilty when I get good grades. Covid hasn’t helped, as I’m positive professors are being easier on students because of the difficult times. 

In the end I feel like an idiot who jumped into the deep end. A kid who’s way over his head. I can tread water for a while but eventually I’ll run out of energy and sink. That soon I’ll be exposed as the fraud who, god knows how, managed to make it this far.

19,slothdawgmillionaire,1619498391,/r/college/comments/mzglxv/after_struggling_with_imposter_syndrome_i_a/,"I started my bachelor's degree 10 years ago, as a last resort to keep from being homeless. My mom, a struggling alcoholic, was unable to help me out of high school, and the residence halls at college was the only last minute option. I didn't want to go to college. 

(My background is important, as it it helps explain what my experience at college with Imposter Syndrome was like.)

I come from a low-income family of substance abusers, high school drop outs, and trauma. My father didn't make it through 8th grade and my mom dropped out in 9th, though eventually getting her GED. This is not to say she was not smart. Intelligence extends far outside of the academic institution. My father inevitably chose drugs and played a part in the dysfunction of my childhood, as I had to move every year, sometimes twice a year. Eventually, my grandmother gained custody of me (though she was far from stable, as well). Basically, I left one hell hole for another. 

Through out my childhood, my mother preached and pushed education, always pushing me for AP classes, extra curriculars, scholars bowl, band, and a part time job. She always told me that education would be my only way out of the generational trauma and cycle. I do not agree with her, though she tried her best. 

The Imposter Syndrome peaked it's head my freshman year of college. Mixed with instability and loneliness, the Imposter Syndrome was able to make me feel like I did not belong in school. I was always feeling a disassociation with the environment there and the monstrosity I come from, as well as the culture and social perspective of all the later generation students. 
I was working full-time trying to make ends meet. I struggled balancing this with marching band and student government association. My GPA at the time was less than a 2.3. I barely was getting by. I over exerted myself for perfection, and had to ""prove myself"" to others. I felt depressed and lonely. 

A year before graduating with my bachelor's I ran out of money and had to work for a year and a half to save and finish. I also had to file for dependency override. I went back to school taking 20 hours in one semester, while working full time at a fast food restaurant. I ended up passing with all A's. I overcome my first battle, but this wasn't enough to warrant me walking across that stage. I still regret not walking. 

This past year with the pandemic, I, on a whim applied for graduate school. I did not have the minimum GPA, but I wrote a genuine letter and pushed myself to communicate with the purest and rawest form of myself. I was accepted. With the help of my husband, I overcame Imposter Syndrome and am graduating next week with a 4.0 GPA. I wrote about Imposter Syndrome in first-generation students recently, and found it therapeutic. I finally acknowledged that I belonged, I am not a fraud, and I did it! 
You can bet that I will be walking across the stage this time with my head held high, and with my now sober mom in the audience. 

Anyways, thanks for reading! I hope you push through anything life throws at you, and give it to yourself.

In high school, I wasn’t necessarily as involved and actually kind of fucked up by slacking off and such, which in turn resulted me in enrolling at a CC instead of directly applying to a 4-year. 

I’ve noticed though, that whenever I have a meeting for these programs about twice a month (depending on the club) I always just feel like I don’t belong. Like everyone else will be chiming in with some extremely thoughtful or educated response to a question or commenting on something I didn’t even think about and when I’m asked to chime in, I kind of give just a really vague statement without any support from the rest of the group (and I always think of better things I could have said later on). 

Maybe I’m just doubting myself, but it definitely feels like I don’t have the mental capacity or give enough effort to be surrounded by such academically decorated individuals and it’s starting to effect my schoolwork, how I think about myself, and opportunities I don’t take advantage of because I feel like I’m not good enough.

21,McCree_,1611125522,/r/college/comments/l13u3s/i_feel_i_dont_belong_where_i_am/," I am a master student at top 5 university, and I am studying applied math and statistics.

I have a rather long story about climbing up the the academic ladder. But now I am super unconfident in myself and never feel so doubt about myself.

When I was 16, I was kicked out of high school because I did something foolish. I was out of my friend's circle and had no one to talk to. And eventually everyone at my previous school hated on me because I was portraited as a ""bad one"" no student should hang out with, by the school community as well as some parents. So I had no place to go for one and half year. Even my parents gave up on me since we have 4 children in family, and my siblings were doing well. The days were so dark, and I became an underdog. On the edge of giving up on myself, I decided to go to a community college, because my last piece of conscience told me that it was never too late to start over again, despite what other people think about me and I was still young. Luckily it worked out, the community college accepted me and gave me the ""last chance"". I cherish the chance this time. I worked very hard and spend 3 times more work than my peers and I pulled ahead. I got straight A's in my math class (the only thing I am ""good"" at), and then I decided to major in math. Things got better and better eventually and professors started believing in my ability and wrote me letters of recommendations for me to transfer to a better college.

After 2 years of studying community college, I ""jumped"" into a top 40 university in pursing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics. This university was where I truly elevated my ability in doing math by spending 10+ hours every single day, including weekends and holidays. I believed that my hard work would pay off. I met lots of encouraging classmates as well as nice professors. I eventually forget that I was once an underdog, who everyone expected to lose at whatever I want to do. My life was getting better. After 2 years of studying in the university, I got my bachelors degree with an honor of GPA 3.947. I built my confidence by not getting a single grade below A- at the most high level math courses in my department. Also, I was so happy that I was able to get a graduate school offer from one of the nation's top 5 universities. I also had offers from other universities, which might not be that challenging, but I decided to shoot for the stars and took the challenge. I believed that since I made it here, I can make it again. I accepted the offer from the ""top 5"" university, but that was where all started to fall down...

I was expecting graduate level math to be hard but... It was not hard, it was INSANELY hard. All the brilliant minds in my department are those I just can't compete. They could finish some hard work (at least for me) fast, whereas I need 5 times more time to do. They could read notes easily and go into homework whereas I have to watch lecture videos again and again while searching all those materials online as I never seen them before. It turned out that most of them had already studied at their undergrad, or in some sense they built much better foundation then I did. They are smart, very smart. For my first quarter, I need to spent much time just to prepare for some ""pre-lecture"" material that professors don't even talk about in class, besides the fact that I have to spend even more hours on course materials. As for problem sets consists 6 questions, I needed help for 5 of them. When I ask a question in group, all other members knew the answer. It made me feel like I was so useless. I barely pulled off the first quarter with okay grades but here it comes the second quarter. Everything gets harder and harder where I don't even recognize the definitions in courses. Courses were so hard that I can't even manage time properly to get some sleep. The pace of courses were moving so fast that I cannot keep up with. Also plus the fact that 99% of my classmates got internships for the summer where I don't even have time because I need to study prerequisite for the following year. It seems they got all their futures planned out where I am the only one in the department that finds myself miserable. I think I am the worst person in everything in my department.

I am on the edge of giving up again. I have been thinking about dropping out many times throughout the week. I feel like I do not belong to a place like this, which was meant for mathematicians to be but not like an underdog like me. I think my department accepted me by accident. It might be true that I did some hard work and accomplished something for last few years. But in the end of the day, I am still the guy that was kicked out, who no college wanted to accept. Maybe all those things in the past few years were enough to be proud of and it is now time to give up because I have reached my limit. Maybe I should drop out, from a graduate school that I do not belong at the first place.",college,I Feel I Don't Belong Where I am,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l13u3s/i_feel_i_dont_belong_where_i_am/,1611143522.0

I started school give or take seven years ago. I've been in and out a handful of times due to academic suspensions. I started back again Fall semester 2020. I finished the semester and have just over 80 credits earned. Next semester I finally get to start taking level one classes for my major.

Searching online says it takes around 120 credits to graduate, but looking at my Audit Reports, I have more than 40 credits of generals left to take, and just about every course for my major. It really doesn't add up. How does graduating work? Do you just keep taking classes then decide to graduate? I read 60 credits would equal an associates degree. How does that work? An associates degree in what? I haven't really taken any specialized classes, just random BS generals.

I really feel like I've learned absolutely nothing the entirety of my time in school, which in a lot of ways is my own fault. But so many of the classes I've taken are all just topics that have absolutely no relevance to my life in any way. The ones that did have importance were dumbed down versions of classes I took in Highschool.

How is college supposed to work? I had roommates who started school the same time I did, and from day one they were learning and doing things related to their majors. They got jobs on campus and outside of campus, related to their majors. They did their four years, enjoyed the time, graduated and got jobs.

Me on the other hand, I got my first schedule from my advisor, and each semester I would have to go meet with her in order to register for classes. We would sit down, look at my audit report and choose classes. She would recommend stuff, and build me a schedule. I eventually got pretty frustrated at taking nothing but generals, and withdrawing from them. I tried to put together a schedule before hand with classes in my major that I needed and some generals that interested me. She turned most of it down.

The classes are numbered in accordance to their level. (idk if this is how it is everywhere) But typically classes in the 100s are entry level classes, up to 400s being advanced level. Not all classes follow this though. Some of my entry level classes I needed are numbered in the 300s. My adviser at the time turned me down on those and told me I wasn't ready for those classes yet.

I did eventually change advisers after being told the way I was registering for classes wasn't normal. Friends told me usually they made their schedule and emailed their adviser for the registration code, and that was it. So now I have an adviser within my major, and she sends out her recommended schedule or a list of classes available for the semester that would be good choices. 

I honestly don't know if it's worth continuing. But, I'm already going to be in debt for life, so who cares how much I rack up at this point?

Something I think about frequently is, what if I had gone to a different school? Would things be different? What if my parents had allowed me to leave the state for school, or if I had realized I had no obligation to listen to them? Would I have had a 'normal' college experience? Where would I be right now? I can't help but think things would be better. I would be in less debt, probably done with school, with a job.",college,How does college work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/klhp8d/how_does_college_work/,1609142210.0

last school year (ig it'd be a semester away since it's first semester of the new school year) i looked up answers for my ap chem test on quizlet. the teacher said later that since ppl cheated she wouldnt grade it. problem is i kinda left evidence and stuff online that i cheated and im worried she'll find it (it's a long story but if she sees it she'll prob 100% know that i cheated on the test and that the person who posted is me). recently i found out that even if im admitted to college and she informs them afterwards then i could get my admission taken at any time. so now im wondering if i should confess or not? if i confess i feel like the worst case is better than if she finds out afterwards and reports me while im enrolled/after i graduate college, which would null all those years i spent in college vs me just accepting an L and going to community college then transferring. not sure if this is worth mentioning but she also confronted our class abt using quizlet for our hw which i def did a lot first semester. i also cheated more out of fear and laziness than necessity; i got a 5 on the ap exam and my test performance has been fairly high (this is the only test i cheated on). i recognize that i've made a mistake and don't plan on cheating ever again.

i've told my parents about this and they seem to be against me confessing. ig the only thing stopping me from confessing rn is that everyone ive talked to says it's a stupid and bad decision. i'm a bit torn on what to do rn. any advice would be really appreciated.

It's been kind of shocking, to say the least, and I'm struggling to stay afloat and transition well. Plus, my parents, are being a bit unreasonable (like letting my brother scream while I'm taking tests and stuff, or video call outside my room). 

I failed all my midterms despite studying pretty hard (didn't get grades back for all, but they can't be good lol I didn't know half the problems on my math test). When my parents asked how I did, I said idk and they kept pestering me until I finally told them. After which they berated me, saying that it was only luck and not hard work that got me in, and that of course I'd fail, and that I should go to CC instead. 

When I brought up asking my brother to be a bit more respectful, they said anywhere in the house it's his right to do what he wants. And, they said that after I realized I didn't belong here, I'd transfer anyway, so it's not worth going on campus. And they said if I was capable of doing well, I wouldn't be making excuses, so that proves that I'm not capable of doing well here.

I haven't been able to sleep or focus well over the past couple of days, I just feel not great overall about myself. I can't help but wonder if my parents are really right about me not being good enough and whether I should give up and transfer.

I'll try my best to transfer, but odds of a successful transfer for me are extremely low. So what can I do to make the most of my college experience, despite the fact that not a day goes by where I don't regret choosing this college? How do I force myself to be satisfied with my decision? Or at least cope with it so that it doesn't consume me every day like it has been for the past year?** 

I'm a rising sophomore at a public university. It's a pretty good school, prestigious in the state and respected around the country, if a little bit obscure because of its size. 

The problem is, I've been attending for a year and not a day goes by that I don't regret my choice in coming to this school. When I was applying to colleges, this was actually my last choice. Not necessarily my safety, admissions wise, but my last choice for what the school actually was. I wanted (and still want) desperately to go out-of-state since I have a lot of bad memories and experiences. I also wanted to attend a larger, more active college since I'm very extroverted. I think I also expected myself to be attending a better, more prestigious school and have been very disappointed with that aspect of my education. 

When deciding between my options, I chose this university because it was the only one I could afford. I am receiving a full ride from this university (which I am grateful for), but every day, I wish I had been able to take out a loan so I could attend the only one of my dream colleges that I was accepted to. I'm an orphan (literally.) so taking out a loan wasn't even an option for me thanks to my non-existent credit score and non-existent parents to cosign. **Ultimately, my choice to go to this university wasn't even a choice.** And that's what gets me. 

When I started last fall, I went in with very little reservations, knowing that it wasn't my fault I couldn't attend my dream college. I even enjoyed and felt comfortable in my decision for the first month. But then everything got out of control. Long story short, I was stalked and harassed which affected my grades which affected my mental health which affected my social life. The thing about going to a small school is that you feel like everyone knows every shameful thing you did when you were depressed. The administration didn't do anything about it and this all impacted me very negatively, making me regret my decision to attend this school even more. I lost friends over this because my mental health was so shitty. I don't feel like I belong or fit in with anyone at this school. At least, not in the way I hoped. 

I'm just not happy. 

I'm going to apply to transfer, but transfer acceptance rates for the schools I can see myself being happy at are extremely low. I mentioned that the stalking and harassment had affected my grades. My GPA isn't the best which is detrimental for transfer applications. I'm planning on applying to transfer for Fall 2021, but  realistically, I don't expect to be accepted anywhere. Even if I am, me being an orphan hasn't changed, so if I don't receive an equivalent scholarship to my new school, I probably won't be able to attend. I'm honestly just applying to transfer so that I can say I tried to make a change. 

That's my story. 

So my question(s) for you guys is this: If you went to a school that you *really* didn't want to attend but you knew transferring wasn't an option, how did you cope? How did you learn to accept where you were? How did you manage to make yourself OK with your decision?

I'm dying to move somewhere else, but I have no idea how I'd afford it or where I'd go because I have no idea what career I want or could get after college (I'm not premed). I barely know anyone who lives in other cities so I'm terrified of being lonely and I have no experience with moving, but I just feel like I'm deeply not a New Englander. Honestly I don't really have much faith in getting a job after college. BU seems to be decently hard to get a good GPA, but still. I feel like it's hard to compete with people who have a better GPA. Also, my younger sister has dyslexia and my family might move so we can afford for her to go to private school. I know I'm so immature and selfish to be sad about this and this is what she needs, but secretly I've been fearing it so much since I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life and a lot of my best friends are still from my high school and it'd be hard to see them much again (I go home for breaks). I'm also in my first relationship and my boyfriend is way more into it than me which really freaks me out, but I can't bring myself to end it even if honestly some of the reason I'm still dating him is just to finally have a boyfriend and not be my stupid self people have looked down on my whole life (I do like him in the ways I should to some extent, which complicates things further).

I'm doing way too much stuff- balancing schoolwork with three clubs (no leadership), exercise, a volunteer position, an on campus job I can choose my hours for, trying to apply for summer internships I likely won't get, my relationship, seeing a bunch of friends that aren't all friends with each other, and still seeing my family semi-regularly/helping with my ten year old sister since I'm not very far from home. And I have terrible time management skills so I waste half the day away when it's incredibly important. I know I need to quit something, but there's nothing I can really quit. Here it is, almost 2 AM, I'm trying to make up the hours I said I did for my job last week, I flaked on my boyfriend today, and I have an 8AM chem lab tomorrow I haven't done the prelab for or last week's postlab.

The worst part is that I know these are all such first world problems and I was given so much opportunity that I don't deserve when a lot of people don't get to go to college (I sound like such a shitty person in this but I really do care about other people and I see myself as worse than the average person), and I'm going to throw this expensive tuition away my parents are killing themselves to pay for away and never get a job and live with them until they die and then who even knows. I might seem like I have low self esteem, but I think I have reason to. I was born without any real talents in an area of success and I don't belong here at all. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for going on and on and this is probably normal for a 19 year old to be unsure of their future, but I just feel like I'll be a total failure (you can probably tell by now interviews aren't going to save me). If anyone has any idea of how I could possibly turn any aspect of my life around, that would be much appreciated.

(pretty big state school with \~25k students, around 35 min from my home) Ever since last year I've felt really lonely and that I don't belong here and made the wrong choice.

First, I can't stand the town that it's in. Rent and prices here are insane, and it's a super congested area and feels like a bubble. The people here are pretty much the polar opposite of my political beliefs, some are really cool and some are assholes (which you'll find anywhere). I've given it a fair try and even explored a lot of stores and food places here, but at the end of the day I just feel like I don't fit in. And I'm not trying to bash this town, I can definitely see why people enjoy it, but the culture here just isn't for me.

Second, I have zero friends here. I tried making friends last year, going to events in my dorm, going to orientation events, going to a Fifa tournament, and even joining an intramural soccer team. But in the end, I just ended up making slight acquaintances and no real friends to chill with . It's weird because my whole life I've never had a problem making friends, I was never popular and always introverted, but I made friends easily in school and on every sports team.

I've gone to a counselor, gone to the gym, and taken care of myself the last year, but I'm still unhappy here. Not to mention, last summer I had a 3 month summer break and I felt a huge weight off my shoulders not being here. I hung out with friends at home and enjoyed working a cool grocery store job and I feel like I'm just happier away from here.

It just hurts because this is a great school, everyone in my close family went here/is associated with here, my scholarships are solid, and it's close to home...I feel like I should be happy here. It also sucks cause deep down inside I don't feel proud to go to this school, and I have no desire to root for the sports teams after watching all the football and basketball games in high school.

Should I stick it out for two more years or go somewhere else? The education here is really good and I don't know where else I would go. If I stuck it out, I'd consider taking a gap semester. While I haven't brought this up to my parents, I know they'll support my decision and will try to encourage me to stay but also support me leaving for another school. My older sibling did do it too, after all.

30,tommy328,1579994884,/r/college/comments/etyiat/considering_switching_majors_but_not_100_sure/,"I am currently a freshman music education major and I'm not sure if I want to continue as a music major. My choice to be a music major was mostly a panic decision.

I almost switched majors within the first 3 weeks of classes because I had such a rough start with my flute (main instrument) professor. Long story short, he spent 10-15 minutes belittling me over not having a book he didn't tell me I needed, in front of another student. I was already scared to be there because I was so far behind everyone else (due to not having lessons or any sort of preparation prior to college for music), and that one lesson with him was almost enough to turn me away. The rest of the semester I was terrified to have my weekly lesson with him because I never knew what version of him I would have that day. Some lessons he was great and would complement things done well. Other lessons he did nothing but attack peoples' personality and who they are as a person rather than on their playing. 

He is known to be emotionally abusive towards his students and many of the studio members have broken down due to his mindset in teaching (he doesn't have a single teaching degree, only performance). It is well known throughout the studio that he thinks that education majors are below performance majors and he only wants to work with the performance students. He'll never change and the institution will never say anything to him because the studio keeps kicking out amazing performers, which is a good thing. Most studio members either double major in education and performance or completely abandon education because he pushes so hard to switch to performance. I don't want to do performance and I'm terrified for when he starts to push me towards it because I'll keep saying no. He's a great performer and I have grown exponentially as a performer myself, but at the cost of my mental health (and wallet).

I stuck it out to finish the semester but the entire time I felt like I didn't really belong in the music program. Most of the people there give off the ""I'm more important than you"" energy and it seems like the program only likes to support that kind of musician. I got my work done and successfully completed my juries, but I can't even count how many times I cried in a practice room, cried driving to and from classes (I commute), and crying myself to sleep because I was so stressed out and uncomfortable in my major. 

One thing that scares me quite a bit is that in middle school and high school, I used to practice for hours on end because I loved it and it made me feel better when I was upset. Now I can barely play my flute without becoming insanely frustrated and start crying and need to put it away. My band director believed in me so much when I couldn't believe in myself and I feel like I'll let him down if I switch, even though I know it's my future that's at stake. I think that ultimately I would be quite happy teaching music and giving others the gift of music, but I don't know if I can go through 4 years of being extremely depressed, anxious, and unhappy with my major and potentially never recover from that. This degree/program has already taken my love of music from me. 

One of my gen-eds was a Intro to Geology class and I absolutely loved it. It helped me realize that I have an actual interest in the history of the earth and life forms that existed (especially dinosaurs).  I kept thinking about it and if I were to switch majors I would potentially switch to Geology with a specialization in Paleobiology and minor in Paleontology. I don't know if I want to switch because it would be a HUGE change and I've already put quite a bit of money into the music degree (it is so expensive and is slowly going to make me broke). Changing majors gets really expensive really quickly if it happens a lot, and I'm still not 100% on the geology degree. I don't know if I'm so unhappy in my major that any way out seems great, or if it'll actually be something for me.

Any advice would help a lot.

31,khaleesi_onthatbeat,1576218502,/r/college/comments/ea0cd1/im_29_about_to_graduate_and_i_am_terrified_about/,"I graduated high school in 2008 in the USA. I busted my ass off then, was in all AP classes (except for math, my weakest subject. Looking back i think its because i didnt have the right kind of teachers or environment for my learning style, nor did i have the discipline and motivation or study skills at the time). 

My SATs slayed pretty well. I got into my dream school  and i pursued a design and tech degree in Theatre Arts. But the program and school I was in was more competitive than I thought, the community was toxic and superficial, i struggled living on my own, making meaningful friendships, and giving up all of my other hobbies to pursue a career in one. 

Turns out I wasnt disciplined or focused enough. I got warned and demoted from a BFA to a BA, and so had to take other required general classes that I had no interest in and was also separated and isolated from a lot of my peers. I felt ashamed. My family made sure to remind me how disappointed they were. All my scholarships and loans and hard work they put to get me into college felt wasted. I slipped into severe depression and it only got worse. I took a semester off. Which turned into dropping out completely because I felt ashamed and scared and my pride was hurt badly. 

I spent the next year living at home, working 2 part-time jobs and paying rent to stay with my parents and cover my phone and car insurance. I tried taking a couple community college courses. At the time, I felt so ashamed and like that this “demotion” was beneath me. From my perspective, only people from my high school who didnt have any direction or were high school duds went to community college. Very few of the people i knew who went there straightened themselves up to transfer to bigger schools or find a good career. A lot of them dropped out and still even now never finished or are on some path with little progression. Even some of the smartest and talented people i knew who messed up and ended up as pizza delivery guys or constantly working in temp jobs. At that time, I judged them, and felt like i didnt belong there. So i flunked community college too. 

I moved out of my home, across country, and started living on my own after some traumatic family events. I started working part-time in food service job and did just that. All i did was work and wander around my new city. I had few friends whom i rarely had time or energy to hang out with, but i did learn some new things. I learned depression management, i learned to keep my space clean and organized (the first time my parents visited me they were in disbelief at how clean my apartment was!), i began exercising again and lost all the weight i gained during college after stopping sports, and being on antidepressants and binge drinking and having poor eating habits. I taught myself how to cook and be more diverse and experimental with eating on a budget. I learned how to dress nicely and wear skirts and dresses and gained some more self-confidence. I got promoted twice until 3 years later i was in a high management position. 

After that I had an opportunity to move abroad with my work. Once my project ended, i decided to stick around and do language study for a year. I also discovered that I could attend University once i passed a certain level of language fluency, for almost 10x cheaper than in the USA. So i applied and was accepted as an international student and restarted college studies with a new major in 2014. 

I was working part time, struggling a lot to pay for school AND living expenses on my own. I experienced racism and stereotyping, neglect towards the international student body and preference towards exchange students from my school’s administration and faculty. I missed out on a lot of the “fun” parts of being a college student. I never explored or traveled around or near the country I was studying in. I had some other traumatic experiences - severe illness. I failed my first semester because i got pneumonia during final exams. I almost died the year after from a heart infection that turned out to be due to me developing an autoimmune disorder and it set me back financially and gave me a lot of stress. But, i started to pay more attention to taking care of my health, eating better, exercising more. I quit a toxic job even though it paid more. I found a lesser-paying, more physically demanding job, but it was close to home and school and my management and coworkers became my family for over 4 years. I got back into sport again. I started really exercising again and my health improved. I made more friends. Despite everything, despite my anxieties and stresses and bouts of depressive episodes, the overall quality of my life did improve a lot. 

I struggled with my grades, managing study and work and having a social life and did not successfully avoid burning myself out. Taking courses bilingually is HARD. 

I dealt with some fuckboys and fake friends and manipulative and self-centered employers. I met the love of my life and also have my own chosen family around me. I was injured and needed surgery and had to quit my team. Only recently, a year later am i becoming active again and overcoming that psychological hurdle. The people in my life who really mattered showed up and helped me through a lot and are by my side still to this day. I rediscovered my faith in God and became more religious which has helped me develop more self-love and patience, manage anxiety, and make even more new friends and discover new things about life and people. 

I finished my last lecture of undergraduate studies today. I have only one final exam and two reports due next week and it’s all finished. Come February I will be matriculating and getting that damn diploma, with a BA in Linguistics and double major in Cognitive Neuroscience and a minor in English Language and Literature. It took me 5 1/2 years to finish this degree. I am almost 8 years later than most of my peers. I have friends and family who are married, getting married and have kids and bought their own homes and even finishing masters and phDs. 

Its so hard not to compare myself. Or minimize my struggles because there are people who have it worse or didn’t even have the opportunity to get a college education. I feel ashamed to celebrate this achievement and feel like its mediocre and nothing special. have been a student and struggling to survive on a minimum wage for so many years, to imagine that I will have a job that pays me every month consistently more than enough that i need to barely survive, have health insurance, a regulated schedule, moving beyond student life...it feels unreal and its terrifying. I still have no idea if what i’m doing next is the right thing or where it will take me. I’m trying to focus on the fact that its out of my hands. I can do my best to sway towards my goals but only God knows where i’m going to go and where i’m supposed to be. I hope grad school, marriage, my own family, an established and forward progressing career, and opportunities to do good for the world are in my future. 

Sorry for the long post. But i just wanted to share. Everyone is on their own path, and their own timelines and not all people do things in the same way as people expect you to. S*** happens and life sometimes sucks a lot most of the time lol. Appreciate the good things as best as you can and focus on the lessons and realizations you can learn from the bad things. Question everything but TRY not to question yourself. (Ugh, i know, easier said than done) Usually your heart is always telling you what’s right. 

Get organized. Use a planner or calendar or whatever method helps keeps you on track of your life. Eat more protein and vegetables. Be active. Cut out toxic people from your life even if it means you have no friends at all for a while. Revisit old friendships that sizzled out. Stay in touch with your family.  It is possible to work and be in school. Part time jobs are not beneath you and teach you valuable social and work ethic skills. Change your major or do a double major or take general ed classes in things that interest you or may teach you something useful and supplementary. Manage your budget. Do things you like that aren’t harmful to you or other people. Practice empathy and kindness as much as possible. To others, and yourself.

Turns out I fucking hate traditional college. I can’t stand physically going to class, it feels like such a waste of time. Not because my professors are trash, they’re great, but because I feel like I could do this all online at a huge fraction of the cost, and the fact that I just don’t belong at my university (huge party place, super expensive and I’m not a social person). My mother is the main reason why I attended this college. Yay, emotional manipulation!

I took online college classes during high school and I loved it and did very well. I was able to work on my own time and I loved the ability to work ahead and make my own “off days”, basically. This would also let me work part-time, start paying off my current student loans, and also save for my future.

I’m a little over halfway through this first semester and I’m running out of steam. My mental health is trashed and it’s gotten to the point of affecting my physical health multiple times like vomiting every other morning at best. I’m for sure going to muster enough strength to get through this semester but I’m unsure if I can do it once again next semester. 

I’m going to do an Associates online next fall then transfer to another online two year program for a B.A.S in environmental science once that A.S is finished. Thing is, not all my courses transfer so I’ll probably be put
behind what would be my typical graduation time (2023). I know tens of thousands of people don’t graduate on time and it’s no big deal, but my family sees it as a failure and online school in general as a failure as well.

33,eam115,1569963851,/r/college/comments/dbzsvl/been_feeling_a_lot_of_imposter_syndrome_lately/,"Hi this is my first time posting here and I’m just looking to know I’m not alone. I’m a second semester junior, I’m ahead of everyone else in my class because of credits that transferred from high school. Because of this I’m in a lot of classes with seniors, in fact in one of my classes I’m the only junior (it’s considered one of the final classes you have to take before graduating, sort of like a capstone) and in the other I’m one of only two or three. I had all the pre recs so it’s not like I’m in the classes without merit but I still feel like I don’t belong there. 

For one thing, all of the other students know each other really well. They’re all good friends having taken classes together since they were freshman. I only know some of them in passing and it also doesn’t help that I started this major (I’m a dual major) a semester into my freshman year so I was already behind with getting to know everyone. I do try to make friends, or at least become friendly with some of my classmates, but I guess since they’ve all been friends since they were freshman and they’re now seniors they aren’t really looking for new friends. 

Being one of the only few juniors, or sometimes the only junior, and feeling kind of alone in those classes makes me feel like I shouldn’t be there or that I’m not smart enough to be there. This all came to a head today when I did embarrassingly bad on an assignment that I should’ve done well on. Everyone else seemed to to just fine but I didn’t. 

I don’t know I guess it just really sucks feeling like you don’t belong, especially in a major you chose and that you’re passionate about. Me being ahead was never an issue but now that I only have my senior seminar classes left to complete I’m scared it’s going to stay this way until I graduate next fall :(",college,"Been feeling a lot of imposter syndrome lately, anyone else feel that way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dbzsvl/been_feeling_a_lot_of_imposter_syndrome_lately/,1569981851.0
34,CookieDoe22,1568214167,/r/college/comments/d2rj0h/i_need_advice_with_handling_roommates/,"In the beginning, my roommate and I were fine, but as the semester went on, she was really quiet. One time I offered her cough drops. She was like, ""Oh, I'm okay. I just get lots of phlegm sometimes."" I'm like, ""you know, there is medicine for that."" Whenever I would offer her something like tissues or whatever, she'd just say, ""no I'm good."" She was really guarded. She almost never smiled. 

Basically, my roommate and I each had lofted beds with desks and drawers underneath. We both decided to change our clothes at our desks so we wouldn't see each other. A few times I've heard her changing her clothes, and one time I heard wrappers tearing....then I heard her wad something up and throw it away. Afterward, she went into the bathroom to wash her hands (We share a half-bathroom with suitemates) I'm assuming she washed her hands because she changed her pad in our dorm room? Idk what else it would be. I checked the trash when she was gone, and I could tell there were menstrual pads in there. (They were wrapped at least). I will say that we didn't have a trashcan in our bathroom. Only the bedroom. I thought it was weird that she did this, but I never said anything until we got bed bugs. I asked her, ""Are we getting reimbursed for this?"" She says nothing. Me: ""You don't know, do you?"" She's like, ""yeah, sorry, idk."" She seemed really irritable and would slam the door, and stomp sometimes, so I never mentioned the pad thing to her, as well as a few other things regarding the room. I was pretty mad, because I'm pretty sure bed bugs are attracted to blood. I looked it up online, and realized my roommate was probably the reason our bed bugs were so bad. (Because she changed pads in the room)

Pest control treated our room, but I wanted to make sure the room was cleaner from then on. I was also pretty fed up with her because she'd leave her desklight on during really strange hours at night/morning. She also left her laundry basket in the way, and used my plastic silverware too much (I told her she could use them, but I began to hide them because she used them too often). I was scared of my roommate because she was an upperclassman and in my experience, door slamming leads to violence. I was panicking, so I told the RA the stuff my roommate did and that I couldn't talk to my roommate about this because I didn't feel safe, and it was an unfriendly environment.

We had a meeting with the RA to make a new roommate agreement. My roommate was super annoyed (I'm assuming because I brought in the RA to talk to her first.) She basically said it was ridiculous that I ""felt unsafe"" and that ""mature adults communicate to the roommate first.""

Her: ""I have a right to be upset. Why did you say I made you feel unsafe????""

Me: ""Because you glare at me, and stomp around and slam the door! Wouldn't you be scared?""

Her: ""I was stressed?""

Me \*slowly\*: ""So is every other college student.""

Her: ""I don't believe you're scared.""

Me: ""That's because I told my parents about this and they said not to act scared so I don't give you power.""

Her:"" But you weren't even friendly???""

Me: ""I offered you cookies and you blew me off!""

I stared at my roommate in the eyes to show her that I wasn't scared of her.

Later in the meeting

Me: ""Desk lights should be turned off from 12-6 am because the lights are SO bright. Also, phones should be off during that time because that's when people are trying to sleep.""

RA to my roommate: ""Is that okay with you?""

My roommate just nods and looks annoyed.

Me: ""Also, no going under each others desks, because that is private property.""

RA: ""What do you want your relationship to look like?""

Me: ""Professional.""

RA:"" And you?""

My roommate: ""That's fine, whatever.""

RA asks about guests.

Me: ""Family should be allowed to visit, because that's important to me.""

My RA asked my roommate if that was okay with her.

My roommate would just nod and never contribute anything to the new roommate agreement. I was basically doing all of the speaking...

Later in the agreement I said, ""sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, because I looked this up and body fluids spread disease and pests and that ALSO makes me feel UNSAFE."" I looked at my roommate dead in the face when I said that, and my roommate seemed a bit taken back. Later, in the meeting I looked at my roommate again and said, ""Dirty pads-"" \*My roommate interrupted me, ""I KNOW. YOU ALREADY SAID THAT."" Me: ""Just making sure you heard me."" After the meeting, my roommate cried and burst out of the lounge. Now I'm not sure if she was actually bullying me or not.....

During Christmas break, she sent me a long text apologizing, but saying she felt it was unfair to blame her for an unfriendly environment. She said she didn't think I was friendly all the time either, and that she had lots of stressful things going on in her life, such as her aunt blocking her, a guy trying to use her, and being rejected from an audition that she really wanted. She said she'd follow the roommate agreement better and that she didn't need anymore drama.. I didn't respond.

2nd semester begins. She apologized for making me feel uncomfortable and brought me oreos. Then everything was friendly. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2.

One time she offered that we meet for dinner once a week to make sure nothing piles up. We set up a day, and on the day we planned she asked in the late afternoon when I usually eat dinner. I said, ""It depends"", because I was busy and working on an assignment. She said nothing else and never asked me about dinner again.

Then, she just stopped trying to talk to me and was a bit passive aggressive during the last couple weeks of school.

Eventually, my college roommate sent me this long text at the end of the year, (after we moved out) confronting me for everything I said to her. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and didn't belong in the psychology field. (my major)

For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot."" I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say.""

She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily. I was like, ""let me see."" She says, ""uhh no...."" I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones.""

There was also a time when she asked if the school internet was working for me. I said, ""Yes, I have unlimited data on my phone.""

She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit. I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes"". She also said she was aware I talked behind her back to my guy friend. Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text.

I will say that I struggle with panic attacks and social skills. I told her this, but apparently she didn't understand since she went off on me.

She also told my mother about this....",college,I need advice with handling roommates.,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d2rj0h/i_need_advice_with_handling_roommates/,1568232167.0

The RA talked to my roommate and we eventually had a meeting together.

We didn't talk for the rest of this semester, but she did follow the roommate agreement and kept the room clean. During Christmas break, she sent me a text saying she didn't appreciate my going behind her back and that she didn't think it was fair to blame me for the unfriendly environment, because she tried to be friendly, too. She said I was condescending towards her sometimes, and that she wasn't very talkative in the room because she's super tired from work all the time. She said she'll follow the roommate agreement, but she doesn't want any drama next semester. I didn't respond.

At the beginning of 2nd semester, she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable and brought me oreos. I agreed that we didn't need anymore tension in the room, and then everything was fine. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2 (She hesitated and he was like, ""maybe another time?"" She said, ""Yeah!""). I was worried she would talk behind my back, which is why I asked him individually why he wanted to be friends with her. Then, one day she suggested we get dinner once a week to just talk and make sure we touch base. I agreed, we set up a date- Monday after 4pm. On the day we planned, that Monday after 4, she asked what time I usually eat dinner. I was like, ""It depends."" She didn't mention it again and we just stopped talking the rest of the semester.

Eventually, my college roommate sent me another long text at the end of the year, confronting me for a bunch of things I said to her. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and I didn't belong in the psychology field (my major) because I judge people for not being ""happy enough"".

For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot.""

I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say.""

She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily.

I was like, ""let me see.""

She says, ""uhh no....""

I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones.""

She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit.

She showed me a pic and said, ""I love this one!""

I looked at it and said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes"".

She also asked me one time if the school's internet was working for me, because it wasn't for her. I responded, ""Yes, I have unlimited data on my phone.""

She also mentioned that I was rude for offering her one of my dresses for one of her auditions. I asked what she was wearing and she said, ""one of those dresses."" I looked at her clothes and then offered her one of my dresses, which she rejected. (This was during 1st semester, before the RA meeting)

Then, at the beginning of the year during welcome week, she showed me a craft she made at an event and asked me if I made one. I responded, ""No, I'm not really into material things. I'm more into making memories.""

There was also a time she auditioned for something in August during fall semester. I asked her how it went and she said she was really nervous but she was happy to get it over with. I said, ""I mean, you're not an A class actor, but for what you're trying to do, it was pretty good. You didn't need to worry."" She also said she was aware I talked behind her back to my guy friend. Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text.

36,CocaBean9,1563714913,/r/college/comments/cfyvf4/did_i_approach_my_college_roommate_the_wrong_way/,"To start off, sometimes I lack social skills and I struggle with panic attacks. From the beginning of the year, my college roommate and I would talk a little bit and stuff, but as the 1st semester went on, she was really quiet. I will say she was out of the room more than me (she had a job), but when she was in the room, she never talked to me first. (Though in the summer she did say she was an introvert before school started). I would sometimes try to be friendly like offering her cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" She was coughing one day and I offered her some cough drops. She was like, ""Oh, I'm good. I just have lots of phlegm sometimes."" I responded, ""You know, they have medicine for that."" She didn't say anything after. I just got bad vibes from her. She didn't smile enough, and when she did, it looked fake. Then, mid-semester, she started doing things that bothered me, such as changing menstrual pads in the dorm room (our beds are lofted, so I never saw her do it, but I could hear the wrapper and I know she threw them in the trash. She at least wrapped them, but still), leaving her desk light on way too late/early, not taking out the trash as much as me, and leaving her laundry basket in the way. Eventually, we had bed bugs. I asked her if we were going to get reimbursed for this, and she looked uncomfortable and didn't say anything. Then I was like, ""You don't know, do you?"" She said, ""Yeah, sorry Idk."" She was super grumpy the day we bagged our stuff (due to the bugs) and slammed the door. She also glared at me a few times.

Honestly, I just decided to tell the RA it wasn't a friendly environment, I was scared my roommate would judge me and I didn't feel safe. The RA talked to my roommate and we eventually had a meeting together. My roommate was super irritated because I didn't talk to her first about the issues I had and she didn't believe I was intimidated by her. She said that personal issues should be discussed with the roommate first, because that's what ""mature adults do.""

Her: ""Why did you say I made you feel unsafe???""

Me"" ""Because you glared at me, slammed the door and stomped! Wouldn't you be scared?""

Her: ""......What? IDK.""

Her: ""...but it's not like I threatened you or anything. Saying you don't feel safe is a very bold claim to make. I don't believe you're scared of me.""

I responded, ""That's because I told my parents about this, and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power.""

Her:...."" But....? You weren't even friendly?!""

Me: ""I offered you cookies! And you blew me off!""

When the RA asked about hygiene during the roommate agreement, I said, ""Sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, and I looked this up-body fluids spread disease and pests and that also makes me feel unsafe."" The RA asked my roommate if that was okay with her and she just nodded.

37,hakagrave,1553432186,/r/college/comments/b4w1y9/what_do_you_typically_need_to_apply_for/,"I mean what sort of paperwork. I'm diagnosed with BPD (Borderline), major depression, anxiety and ADHD. I started going to community college last Fall after dropping out of high school 6ish years ago, my first semester was on campus and very rough, I did great in my classes, but my anxiety made me miss so many days I got a C in my psychology class because she had an incredibly strict allowance of 2 sick days for the whole semester. Even after speaking with her in private she never budged, even when I offered to get a note from my therapist. It was extremely frustrating seeing as she was a therapist herself. She told me to take online classes next semester, which out of fear, I did. That's where I'm at now. 

Online classes are less stressful for my anxiety, but more difficult with my ADHD and depression. It enables me to not go outside, which puts me in terrible episodes and I find it impossible to complete assignments some days. I passed my first half with As, but my last two classes are a struggle right now. As much as I love being isolated, I think I have to get back on campus for Fall or I'll be getting myself in trouble. I'm only taking two online classes during Summer, so I'm hoping those will be okay.

My anxiety alone has me terrified of setting foot in the disability office, however. I feel like I don't belong in there and like I'll somehow be turned away despite knowing at least depression falls under the list of disabilities. I'm getting extremely frustrated because when I'm on campus, my anxiety is through the roof, if I even walk in the wrong direction I will panic, and speaking to any staff or faculty makes me wanna go home immediately. I get very overwhelmed and my school's website has little to no information. Calling sounds dreadful to me as well. 

I just need some information, even if it's vague because I'm struggling. I'm a good student and I'm able to get good grades and high As when I can sit down and not panic or worry about missing a day because of my mental health. I'm starting to feel like college isn't for me and I'm in way over my head, but I worked on my issues for half a decade to pursue my dreams and I don't want these things I can't control to win. I'm too afraid to speak to anyone about it because they might tell me it's too much for me to handle.",college,What do you typically need to apply for disability at school?

38,TheRealJimboJam,1547016596,/r/college/comments/ae49j9/kutztown_university_avoid_this_college/," Let me start off my saying that I was a student at Kutztown for about 3.5 years and I was enrolled in two different programs. It seems as though most of the people leaving reviews for the university are either visitors or have been enrolled for a brief period of time, so understand that this is review is coming from someone who has experienced every element of Kutztown University for several years.

Kutztown University has one of the most beautiful campuses for a medium sized state college – this is probably its best feature and it is also what convinces most students to apply. There are several restaurants off campus, especially pizzerias, which are popular among the student population. My personal favorites are Tommy Boys, Spuds, and The Frying Dutchman. Other businesses, such as automobile shops, grocery stores, barber shops, and a few others are accessible to students and can easily be reached by Kutztown University’s provided transportation. Collectively, these are the only positive aspects of the university.

When I began my enrollment at Kutztown University, I was a Business Administration major. The vast majority of my professors seemed uninterested in their students and gave uninspiring lectures that often left the students confused to an unnecessary level. Moreover, the professors would often neglect the students and provide responses, such as “get a tutor” or “maybe you should drop the class” when asking for help. Keep in mind, this was not the attitude of just one professor, but rather the majority of the faculty. At first, I studied and was extremely critical about my classes, but after receiving low grades on my exams and assignments, I began to give up, thinking that I was intellectually incapable of succeeding in a college setting. My grades began to decline and essentially, I stopped studying all together. Interestingly, I noticed that even the most dedicated students were receiving the same grades as me, and at that point, I knew that it was the professors and not the students. In general, the trend that I noticed among my business classes is that in every lecture (60-120 students), only 2-4 students exceptionally did well on exams.

A few years later, I decided that I no longer wanted to remain a business major and selected Software Engineering as my replacement. This is one of the least popular majors at Kutztown University and is probably the most common major that students transfer out of due to its extreme pressure and difficulty. When learning how to program, it is important to acquire and develop your own style that you can use to your advantage – many professors will discourage this and tell you to write your programs/scripts exactly how they want you to write them. For beginners, this is intimidating and unbelievably stressful. You will see your peers rapidly disappear from your courses, and by the end of the semester, maybe half of the class will remain. To best describe Software Engineering at Kutztown, it is like putting sand in a filter, where each grain of sand represents a student and the filter represents the course. Very quickly, the sand will fall through the filter and be blown away by the wind. Truthfully, the only professor that I could recommend from that department is Professor Pham, who is extremely patient, helpful, and somehow makes programming an enjoyable experience. Professor Frye seems very friendly, but I cannot provide feedback on her because I never had her as a professor. Additionally, I have heard wonderful things about Professor Spiegel, but have never taken him as a professor, either. As for the other professors, they are all egotistical, short-tempered, and arrogant. Inevitably, you will have to deal with one of them, and they will try to break you. For every assignment, they will provide you with extremely vague instructions and expect you to simply make a program work within a short time frame. I will provide specific examples to emphasize the importance of the matter:

\- I took Professor Tan for an app development course. We didn’t work on any projects for the entire semester and rarely spent time coding. Rather, he provided us with a template to look at and briefly told us what the different blocks of code meant. By the end of the semester, we were asked to make an app by using a programming language that we were entirely unfamiliar with. Additionally, the class began by Professor Tan stating the following: “I have never taught this class before, and I am unfamiliar with the material, so hopefully we can teach each other” – these are words that should never come out of a professor’s mouth after each student had just spent over $1,000 dollars on the course + textbooks. Software Engineering students are entitled to having a professor who is fully knowledgeable about the material, especially considering that Software Engineering is one of the most, if not the most, difficult majors to belong to. Professor Tan was extremely difficult to work with and is purposely avoided by the students because of this. Additionally, there is a major communication barrier that makes it impossible to pass his courses.

\- My advisor in the major (whose name will not be mentioned) had told me to take a specific math course and science course because they were required. A few months later, after taking the courses, I met with him again. During this meeting, he confusingly looked at me and asked why I took those two courses and then stated that they were not needed for me to graduate. Welp, there goes $2,500 dollars and several hours that could have been used for courses that I needed.

\- When asking the computer science professors for help, they will always look at you with disgust and assume that you didn’t attempt to even begin the assignment. You will be prompted with an initial, “Did you even try to do this?,” followed by, “If you need help, use google or go to the graduate center for assistance.”

\- Professors, such as Professor Hussain, Professor Schwesinger, and Professor Shim will seem reasonable to communicate with at first, but after a few lessons, they will begin to show their confrontational side and reluctancy to assist you. Professors such as these fail to realize that their courses need to be taught at an introductory level. Students taking these professors, including myself, would feel hesitant to answer questions during each lesson due to the negative, aggressive behavior of these professors.

These examples represent the smallest portion of what you will encounter if you choose to be a computer science major. In my example, I mention the graduate center. Essentially, this is a place where graduate students get paid by the department to help out computer science students who are struggling. There is generally one graduate student working there at a time and approximately 5-15 students waiting to receive assistance. On busier days, there may be 20+ students waiting to receive help. Often, students are unable to receive assistance because of this and ultimately receive a failing grade. Additionally, the graduate students are similar to the professors in regard to their behavior. When asking for help, you will receive a sassy response and an indication that the graduate student does not want to help you.

To put this into perspective, imagine trying to learn how to program from scratch – the books are sometimes outdated, contradict your professor’s lesson, and are written for those who are already experienced with programming. Desperately, you watch videos on YouTube, email your professors, try to communicate with your classmates, visit websites, read books (assigned and unassigned), look at examples, read forums, and try to find other outside sources to help you complete your assignment, but alas, you find nothing that can help you because Kutztown University cluelessly introduced you to programming in an inefficient manner based on their self-destructive curriculum. Before you say, “well, that won’t happen to me because I excel in school,” understand that this post represents the consensus of student’s opinions and not just my biased opinion.

In short, if you want to learn programming, you’re better off doing it on your own, at your own pace. I highly recommend watching Sentdex and TheNewBoston on YouTube – they will teach you better than any professor at Kutztown University. If you have any more questions about this or would like to provide feedback, feel free to do so by commenting and I will respond within 12 hours.

When I first applied at Kutztown University, the acceptance rate was significantly lower. In 2016, the acceptance rate had risen to 82%, and the rate may have increased since then. When increasing the acceptance rate of a college, it is necessary to also readjust the curriculum so the material is balanced and fair. Kutztown University failed to adjust its curriculum, which is why almost all of your peers will either drop out or transfer within the first two years.

Earlier I mentioned how Kutztown University cares about their landscaping and art. I think that it is important to mention that they only take care of their campus during orientation/tours. Once the tour session is over, you will notice that the only landscaping job that is frequently conducted is the mowing of the grass. Buildings will begin to collect dust and be filled with insects, the fish tanks in the science building will be neglected, and you will find it unbearable to spend time in any of the buildings, especially if you are a germaphobe or fear insects.

I dormed in University Place my freshman year, which I thoroughly enjoyed. This has now become a dormitory for students in their Sophomore year or higher. Freshmen are now divided in the dorms around campus which share little similarities. If you are fortunate, you will dorm in a newer building with modern bathrooms, air conditioning, and a standard dorm layout. Those who are not as lucky will have to purchase fans or A/C units in the summer and will live in an older, outdated dormitory. This is far from fair considering each dormitory has close to identical fees.

For those who are interested with the party life of the campus, you are unable to possess any drugs or alcohol while on the premises of Kutztown University, regardless of your age. This rule is not enforced heavily, and students are usually only penalized if they are reported. You will be most successful in your partying ventures if you become a member of the campus’s Greek Life or if you are 21 or older. Most colleges have party streets where each house will host parties, while Kutztown offers a few houses out of range from each other that often reject students who want to enter their party. If you do manage to find a party at Kutztown, you will most likely be dissatisfied and sober.

There are a few professors, including Professor Donner, Professor Downing, Professor Su Kong, Professor Pham, and several in the biology/chemistry department who are pleasant to be around and provide great lectures. Many of these professors inspired me to excel and made me truly excited to participate in each lesson. As for most of the other professors, you will experience extreme anxiety, stress, and difficulties succeeding due to their incompetence. During the final week of one of my semesters at Kutztown University, the workload and projects became so overbearing and impossible to complete (even though I started weeks in advance), that I started experiencing intense eye-twitching, chest pain, and extreme brain fog for about 2-3 weeks. Sadly, this is the effect of poor teaching methods and expecting the impossible out of students.

The university’s spending is unorganized and poorly distributed. You will see new updates to the school each year, such as touch screen monitors and new furniture in each building to simply attract new students and create an illusion that the school is modern and is a good learning environment. Funds are generally used for visual purposes, but they are rarely used to improve the actual state of the school. Rather than creating more parking (which is indescribably necessary), putting A/C in each building, expanding on the programs of the school, and improving the tutoring department, the university decides to spend its funds randomly and without much thought or care. About a year ago, A/C was placed inside Lytle, a building that consists of math and English professors. The project was apparently $1,000,000 according to an e-mail that was sent from the school’s president. About three months later, we received an email that the building was to be destroyed and rebuilt, which would be a multi-million-dollar project, rendering the A/C project useless and wasteful. Additionally, they recently removed a large portion of the books from their library, leaving several areas of the library empty and lacking purpose.

Shortly after coming to Kutztown University, I became vegan. This lifestyle became almost impossible to maintain due to the lack of healthy options around campus. Several of the restaurants that provided vegan meals are now removed entirely. In order to save money, these restaurants were replaced with a buffet that is less expensive to maintain, yet charges students more money to dine. Thus, if you are vegan, you will be making several trips to the local grocery store and on campus book store/marketplace. If you are not vegan, then you will most likely become disgusted with the food and gain significant weight during your first semester.

In order to arrive to class on time, students often take the public transportation provided from the school. Beware… the drivers are always inconsistent, and you will inevitably be late to your class, causing you to either lose attendance points or be locked out of your classroom. This is especially important for those who choose to live off campus – the bus will often take an extremely long time to arrive at your complex due to its extended route, although there is supposed to be a bus arrival every 15 minutes.

Financial aid, registration, and other departments of that sort will lose your paperwork very frequently. Additionally, the employees are often very rude and stereotypical. Aside from a few individuals in the financial aid department, I always found it unbearable and extremely difficult to get things done with those departments.

If you work on campus, you are most likely going to earn minimum wage. For two years, I worked at Dixon Marketplace (a small market that sells misc. items on campus). My coworkers and managers were generally nice, and my overall experience was good. If you work on campus, you are often provided with the chance to complete your course assignments at your job (at least I was allowed to). This privilege is slowly going away and may not be available anymore. I would always receive my paychecks on time and was always paid the correct amount.

Recently, I transferred to a new school and I just finished the semester will all A’s. This goal was impossible to attain and Kutztown University, regardless of what I could have done differently. I have communicated with another individual who recently left Kutztown University who was also receiving bad grades but is now receiving all A’s. This leads me to the solid conclusion that Kutztown University, and its faculty, are the true reason behind its low retention and graduation rates. Additionally, I have been experiencing significantly less stress and have found this new institute to be more helpful on every level. I highly recommend finding a school that fits your needs. Kutztown University doesn’t truly specialize in anything and will provide you will very little, regardless of how much you contribute to them.",college,Kutztown University | Avoid this College,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ae49j9/kutztown_university_avoid_this_college/,1547034596.0

Took very easy intro courses and did not have to study too much. I got accepted into a private university in the area along with some public schools, so I took the private option and went here. I can study 10 times more than I did at a CC and get a much lower gpa. It's just disheartening and I this point with my end goal being grad school, I feel like I'm wasting my time. 

Everyone just seems way smarter(finishing up my 3rd semester), got a C in a major class after going to every SI and tutoring sessions and at this point I just wanna be done here. Some people don't even go to class and get As, like really?! I did not take any AP courses or the like or hard sciences in high school but I'm thinking of being a biology major and going to graduate schools in healthcare and that C was in a general biology course. 

Everything just comes so easy to some people here like oh this is simple or I learned this in some high level high school class and I came from a pretty bad public high school that did not teach much of anything. And I know I had lower test scores and stuff than most people here too, maybe I'm just too dumb to be here.
  
I may have to retake the class, I'll see, I know some programs accept Cs so my advisor said to just keep going along with courses. I do have a scholarship that requires a 3.0 and am tempted to get out before things get worse.

Failed my first physics test this semester too, so that's also been a struggle, thankfully the class is graded on a curve and I can manage a low A if this final goes well Monday.

I spent my HS years grinding to go to a prestigious university, and by the time senior year rolled around, Northwestern University was my dream school. It had the best location close to home, a decent campus, and a lovely media department (filmmaking and radio are hobbies of mine). Despite my family's misgivings about cost, whenever I was on campus or saw it’s name I felt it was \*my\* school. And, lo and behold, I got in! (As for the other top 20’s around my home city of Chicago, I also got into Notre Dame but not UChicago).

Yet when it came time to choose in April, I panicked. I heard stressful things about NU. That people there were always overworked, when I visited people were uber-professional and serious (which isn't what I'm like, I can be pretty goofy). It seemed to be a lot of work for a school that isn't as prestigious as, say, UChicago or Harvard, and I didn’t want to be stressed anymore. While I was considering Tulane University over NU, on May 1 (the deadline to choose), at 7:30PM, I had a flash of knowledge. I'll go to Notre Dame! It's plenty prestigious, people there seemed happy, the focus on the whole person was dope (as opposed to just being pre-professional), and, unlike Tulane, it's close to home! I paid the deposit.

...the next morning I felt awful. Why did I choose to go to South Bend over Evanston, just outside Chicago? Do I actually belong at a Catholic school? Did I just waste my dream of Northwestern? Long story short, I submitted a deposit to NU the next day, too .(I had filled out a form that meant I was able to do it late). Of course, I still had to decide where to go college.

I didn't decide until August. In the mean time, I was turned down by the girl of my dreams after prom, so I was a broken man in both mind and heart. Life sucked. I graduated high school, and spent the best part of an otherwise awesome summer break ruminating. For three months, deciding which school was the only thought on my mind from morning 'til night, and it gave me so much anxiety I could hardly function at times. My thoughts became pretty erratic and I was often suicidal. How pathetic was I? Here I was, the funny, tall, and undoubtedly intelligent star of my high school, wanting to kill myself because I couldn't choose between two great colleges. My world completely crumbled; my mind went to hell and still hasn't completely come back.

The whole time I filled out housing, placement exams, and such for \*both\* schools. Eventually, it came time to actually pay tuition. I obviously couldn't pay to both schools, so, with a lot of anxiety... I chose Notre Dame, much for the same reasons I paid the deposit in the first place.

I've now spent a month there, and it's... fine. My roommates are cool, my professors are pretty good teachers, my classes are interesting, and I think I've adjusted to the courseload pretty well. But, my dorm itself looks like a prison built by a Catholic school, I'm physically uncomfortable all the time, and I hate South Bend so much. As someone who loves live music and festivals and big cities, it feels like I'm not part of the rest of the world, and since there's nothing to do there everyone just drinks on the weekends. I don't drink, but even if I did, it looks like it'd be boring after like a month. As someone who doesn't like football, even the legendary ND football games get pretty monotone after about a quarter or so.

Is this what my college years will be like? Work all week, and then spend the weekends downing Natty Lites in a house off-campus in a do-nothing town? 

It's my first weekend back home and I've realized how unhappy I've been. I still don't have the feeling of wanting to be a part of ND, whereas I still wanna be in Northwestern-- even as I'm typing this. I'm worried by the fact I chose the less prestigious school, that my peers aren't as intellectually motivated as I am (though a few are), and that the academics just don't suit how interested I am in so many disciplines . On the other hand, I definitely agree with ND's mission (""to be a force for good"") over NU's superficial professionalism. I like that I'll instantly form a connection with the ND ""family"" around the world after I graduate, and I like that people think of ND as ""home"" even after they graduate-- it's a sentiment I'd like to have too, especially in this crazy world. 

In short, every time I see Notre Dame or any of its logos (which is often), I feel unsure of my decision. 

Today is coincidentally Northwestern's move-in. Though I haven't filled out any forms or logged into my account or had any contact with them for a while, I still haven't officially told them I'm not coming. I feel terrible for unfairly and illegally taking someone's spot in that awesome school, and to still be enrolled in both (presumably, maybe NU took me off the rolls). Plus, I can't go back. Even if I want to go to Northwestern, I'll never get in again after what I did-- I'd be lucky if they didn't report me for enrolling in two schools. Transferring to another college is difficult and it would mean going away from home further (unless I go to UChicago). And yet, I always feel like I'm not supposed to be at Notre Dame.

This time last year I felt so much potential after all the years I worked in HS. The future was gonna be amazing! I was gonna go to a great university! I was going to do great, maybe even historic things with my intellect! But, the future isn't amazing. Do I go to a good school? Will I become great? I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever feel normal again.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. I know my problems are pretty good ones compared to the rest of the world, so sorry for being so whiny and acting like a r/iamverysmart bozo. It just helps to finally have all my worries out there.

TL;DR: Submitted deposits to two really good schools, eventually chose the one that \*wasn't\* my dream school, and I still feel absolutely buzzed out about it. :/",college,"I don't feel too good at my college choice, and I felt even worse deciding.

I finished my bachelors in five years. I’m 23 years old. 

I really appreciated my college experience, and graduated with a degree I am personally proud of. 

However, I didn’t do much in the way of extracurricular activities; the vast majority of the student population at my college that attended clubs often made me uncomfortable and gave me throw backs to high school. It took very little time for me to decide that’s not where I wanted to be. On top of that, commuting took a huge chunk out of my day, and I felt like I never really had time for much. 

Now I feel like that was a huge mistake. 

I also didn’t have a job for most of my college career, and the one I did have is totally irrelevant to what I wanted to do. 

I would like to pursue editing, but getting an editing internship is proving to be difficult. I should have gotten one in my junior year of college, but I was suffering with severe depression at that time, and basically withdrew into myself for that year. 

Senior year was when I started searching and applying, but so far, no luck. I don’t really have the most robust resume. I do volunteer work with animals, but that’s not relevant to editing. I walk dogs, but again, not relevant to editing. 

I’m not really sure where to go from here. I’m not sure what jobs to look into. I have a major in English and a minor in Psychology. I also do photography.

I dunno. I’m rambling at this point, but walking dogs is really not the best income. Any advice would really be appreciated!",college,"I majored in English and just graduated with a bachelors.

42,654321360180,1532379452,/r/college/comments/91awv2/academic_apathy_and_depression_about_college/,"I've posted this in another subreddit but the people there suggested that I post this here, so yeah.

It’s kinda late at night, so I apologize if I am not making too much sense. For some background context, I am a rising sophomore at Berkeley and intended biology + public health, possibly getting a minor in Spanish and premed.

I am also sorry if this does not belong here, but I need someone/a few people to listen, and redirects to another subreddit would also be appreciated.

But ever since sophomore year of HS, I’ve been feeling so apathetic about academics/school and life in general. I’d wake up extremely crabby when my alarm went off and think, “fuck my life, another fucking day of school and more homework and more tests. Ugh.” I did well overall in high school, but I was just so annoyed by all the work and having to study for no good reason at all, other than getting A’s and trying to get a strong academic record for college, not passion or whatever. I took AP’s I had no interest in, like World History, and hated it.

In fact, I ditched a day of school in senior year and got a detention for it lmao. That was because like why the fuck do I have to come on a Friday if I have 2 finals on Monday and if I'm a senior? That was a manifestation of my apathy in the truest form. In fact, the dean was super surprised (and he's a very strict disciplinarian who has seen everything) that someone like me did that.

I had already gotten into college and didn't see the value of coming that day if an assembly was going to take up a good half of the day and prevent me from studying for my calculus and psychology finals, since those were more important than my faithful attendance at school at that point as a second semester senior.

It paid off, I guess, since I got into Berkeley. However, like another poster said here earlier, there is no end in sight in college. You think it all ends in HS when you get into college, but it doesn’t. Personally, I feel like the classes are much harder and that the stakes are much higher, especially being premed and all. And because medical school is harder to get into than undergrad, it feels like I’m even further back at the starting line and in an even worse spot academically.

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if I shot myself in the foot going to Berkeley as a premed, with the grade deflation and (subjectively) depressing environment. I am from SoCal, so I would feel more comfortable at UCLA, arguably, which I also got into but regrettably did not SIR to. I knew more people (and my cousin) who go and went to Cal, and the semester system was reassuring to me—more time to raise grades if an exam went wrong or something.

I just don’t have much confidence in my ability to succeed there and wonder whether I’d be better off in humanities or a more humanities-based career, since I feel more confident about my writing vs. quantitative skills.

Right now, I’m taking an English class at a CC, and the academic apathy has come back with full, vicious force especially since it is the last week of class. I thought my professor was entertaining initially, but now I just get so angry at his digressions and attempts at humor, especially because they don’t have anything to do with what they’re learning. I’m contemplating ditching later today honestly. Ugh.

So yes, all of this apathy and depression has spiraled into thoughts like “I should just take a semester off from Berkeley to like get a part time job and figure my life out outside of academics, or just drop out and become a plumber or something because idgaf about school anymore.”

I just feel like school isn’t about anything but just getting straight A’s and getting into clubs and internships at Berkeley to advance my academic and professional development to get into college, and I’m so tired of all that gunning, studying and hard work for seemingly no point.

I recognize that I do not have to be a doctor to make a living. If that doesn’t work, here’s my flowchart, the arrows, or boxes, rather, representing what my next step is if it doesn’t work out.

Doctor nurse doctorate/masters in public health therapist in mental health  HS science teacher.

But that still doesn’t rid me of my academic apathy and jaded feelings towards school and Berkeley.

Moreover, I could just become a teacher or something else up there that wouldn’t necessarily require tip-top grades, but then I’m not sure if I’d entirely like my job or regret not trying to get into med school. I am still very confused and apathetic and certainly not looking forward to 2 hours of some stupid English class lmao.

How do I rid myself of this academic apathy/borderline frustration and anger towards school and assignments?

How can I find meaning in learning beyond just getting A’s and actually look forward to being challenged/taking classes/whatever?

Honestly I've been getting annoyed at everything in life recently and have thought of self-harm because of all the anger, uncertainty, and jadedness I feel towards life and classes and my future.",college,Academic Apathy and Depression About College,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/91awv2/academic_apathy_and_depression_about_college/,1532397452.0

I know many words and their meanings but rarely ever use them or don't know when it's right to use them. Some people here seem to love to use the full extent of their vocab in normal everyday conversation; 95% of the time they're words I know but rarely use and I feel award speaking like that. My essays seem to be written by a high schooler for the same reason, I can express my ideas and have always had great comprehension skills; it's a matter of beefing up my papers to college level.

Once my gpa started over I ended last semester with a 2.3 and I've had to drop classes because I can't handle the 15-18 credit workload and barely manage 12 now. I guess it's worth mentioning that I have clinical depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, frequent panic attacks as I know they can interfere with academic performance, concentration, and life in general.

I entered college as a freshman(Mizzou) without any career path in mind, as a business student. I knew I didn't want to be a business major but Mizzou requires all students to enter with a selected major. After first semester of freshman year I changed my major to undeclared. I figured that as time went on I would soon know my desired career path. This was not the case. 
Summer after freshman year I became very depressed, I felt that my peers all knew what they wanted to do and had a place to go. I felt very lost and alone. Come sophomore year I declared my major to be philosophy, it was the only major that seemed interesting at the time. I trudged my way through sophomore year with decent grades but everything still felt so empty; I was not enthralled by school or anything for that matter. Junior year started this august and I had mentally prepared myself to take on a new perspective and commit myself. Everything flopped on its head, I failed and thus withdrew from nearly all my classes and developed an addiction to weed. As it stands now I am split between three major decisions but remain open to any other options you have to offer. I could continue at Mizzou and get a degree in philosophy, I could transfer colleges with hopes that a new environment will change things, or I could move back home and work full time for a while. 
Currently I feel useless and lonely, I don't provide for anyone or belong to anything, I'm like driftwood. I would like to do something that helps others and improves their lives, I feel like college is all about you rather than us. High school had much more of a community built around it. There is a lot of pressure from my family to finish a college degree but internally I feel I just can't right now. 
I just want to know what your guy's thoughts are, I feel that I cloud my own judgment and would like an outside perspective. Have any of you been through something similar?

I would make average grades but it would be indifferent to me. Right now im a senior and I'm starting to feel a little freaked out with how lost I feel. My parents have always kind of pressured college on me and the people around me but after looking at majors and thinking how much I really don't feel like I belong in college I don't really know what to do. I looked at a list of all of the majors but honestly they all looked boring as shit! I've taken my ACT but I did not score well ( I got an 18 ) while all the other people around me got in the 25s and 30s range. My gpa is a 3.9 right now but that is weighted and I have no Idea what that would be unweighted. I took two AP classes my junior year in psychology and chemistry but failed both of them and honestly didnt like the subjects. Im not involved in any clubs besides a volunteer club because my mom made me join valled NHS. Otherwise all the clubs I tried I hated ( Cross country, Robotics, Band, chemistry, ect.). My interest in life have been listening to music thats relaxing or chill, pop but not generic overplayed pop, indie songs, and electronic. I also absolutely love video games but I dont really feel like making video gsmes or designing levels or anything of that sort. However, recently Ive bought a sketch book and Ive been trying art and love it, but I feel like I shouldnt try and turn art into a career option yet because its way too early and im still learning the fundamentals self studying, and I kind of dont want to ruin this thing that makes me happy by making it a career move, but ive always looked at art in the past but the stigma of requiring or ""having to be born with the talent"" made me give up and not pursue it, now I'm over that and I really enjoy it, art in video games mainly or cartoons I enjoyed as a kid or new ones (steven universe, adventure time, gravity falls, ect.) I really don't know what to do right now and my parents told me that if college wasn't for me that was ok, I havent told them about my love for art because im still new and theyve tried to turn everything i like into a hobby and it ends up ruining it for me and making me feel too pressured to enjoy it. My parents plan to take me college touring in Texas but I looked on college board at art majors and animation and such and not many colleges in the area of Texas seem very geared towards art, My parents have told me I can only afford to go instate but honestly Ive always wanted to go out of state, and I dont think we can qualify for financial aid because my dad makes too much, im not sure if he cant pay or is just not willing to pay full, he says that he'll pay half and that I have to come up with the rest on my own, but its better than nothing tbh.

Basically, rather than come as a regular ""student"" for the fall semester, I would have the chance to join with 150 other students the ""Washington Mentorship Program.""  In it, I would have the opportunity to find an internship in Washington, D.C. and take some basic courses for credit while living on AU's campus with all of the benefits of being an AU admitted student––I would then start my degree program in the spring semester and be on track to graduate with the class of 2021.  I spoke to a lot of students who did this; they said there was no feeling of being ""lesser"" to admitted students.  In fact, they didn't feel a difference between themselves and the admitted.  AU told us that they do the mentorship program to offer students they couldn't fit in with fall admission but otherwise would've admitted and fit the school's profile.

I visited AU for their admitted students day two days ago and was neither especially excited nor let down by the school; the campus is fine and I know their political science department (what I want to major in) is good.  Basically, I'd be content going to AU and know I'd probably end up loving it anyway.

On the other hand, I got into Bucknell wholesale.  On paper, Bucknell is a more prestigious school: it's also very different.  Bucknell has ~3500 undergraduate students versus that to AU's ~7300.  It's a liberal arts, bubbly school.  I went to a prestigious private boarding school for high school that too was very bubbly and campus-focused with student life; I'm not quite sure I want to repeat that.  AU, without a doubt, is more urban and definitely less fraternity-focused (fraternities, from what students told me, are central to student life at Bucknell).  Yet, I was also impressed with Bucknell when I went to their freshman day yesterday––I went to a sample lecture from their Chair of their Political Science Department and was impressed to say the least.  Their library was also nice.  But I also really want to be in D.C.: like, I belong in it.

Thus, I assume that at face-value, from a ""resumé"" perspective, having Bucknell would be a leg-up for employers in the future, applying to graduate school, etc.  But I like *need* to be in D.C.; I plan to major in political science and take a pre-law track.  Something tells me being at American would be better for that, especially since they have a law school on-campus with resources that I would have access to.

I'm an incoming freshman and I haven't attended my university yet. During the college decision process, it turns out that my top school was too expensive, so I decided to go to another university, the one that my brother attends and my twin sister will attend with me. That being said, I don't mind going to college with my siblings, I love them both very much and I get along pretty well with them. Also, the campus is large as heck, and I could easily get away from them if I ever wanted to.

The problem is that when my sister and I attended orientation, I just felt like I did not belong on campus. It's not that I felt alienated by other people. My classmates are all really nice and outgoing! It's just that I felt empty there, and I just did not enjoy it at all.

It's my first semester at a university and its great, way better than a community college environment overall. Although, I'm really stressed and pretty sure I have some form of anxiety. At night I wake up and can't sleep after 4 A.M. no matter how tired I may be and the constant thoughts of where I am going in life, will I be able to afford school, will I make it into my major, what will I do if I don't, how bad I am with girls still at age 21, will I be alone forever, am I doing things the right way or am I headed in the wrong direction, did I miss anything, etc.

I know it sounds like normal stuff that everyone thinks about but I really feel like its much worse and its taking a toll on myself and sleep time. Even when I leave campus, I feel dismal since I don't really have close friends there and feel so out of place at school and everywhere I go because of so many different things. Anyways, I have all these things I feel like I need to get out to a professional because there are times when I feel like breaking down. I know that every University is different, but have people gone to a counselor at their school and received help for this type of situation?

I really don't know what I have, maybe someone on here knows better than me. This all might be really stupid things that I'm making a bigger deal but I overthink, over analyze, I know I have a type of anxiety, I'm the first in my family to go to college so I've done everything up to here myself, I just overall think I need some kind of help or someone to open up to who can give me advice. There are so many other things that go beyond small issues that can be fixed through passing a class, I have issues that have stayed with me growing up. Not health problems or any kind of abuse, I just really feel like I don't belong with anyone, not my family or friends or even the area I live in. No ones really discriminated against me but I just feel like I don't belong. I mean are these reasonable things to go to a counselor at my university for help with?

Also, at my university I get one chance to apply to my major, Accounting. If I don't get in then I am out of luck and have to pick another major or transfer to another school and get my Bachelors in Accounting there. I am applying this semester, I am making sure my application looks good but my GPA is most likely from my community college and that is a 3.43. It requires a 3.0 to get in but I keep hearing you need a 3.5 to be competitive so that scares me.

Application deadlines for other schools have pretty much ended but one has been left open because they have available space. I don't know when it will close so I'm going to apply by tomorrow the latest. I have applied twice already to that university but I declined both times so I don't know if they will take that into consideration. My question is, say I missed the second schools deadline or I don't get in, is it possible for me to leave my university, work for the fall, and apply for the spring semester at another university or will that look horrible? I was also thinking about transferring to a community college and taking a full semester of random classes to help me meet the 150 credits for the CPA faster while I wait to apply for another university for the Spring of 2017 or what can I do in that situation because I really do not need/can't take anymore classes from my current university for my major?

I know these are two very different answers, but any help would be great.

tldr; 1. Have a kind of anxiety, stressing a lot, can't even sleep properly, overthink, over analyze, dating issues, don't feel like I fit in or belong anywhere (just not comfortable anywhere), and other issues that bother me, is it ok to talk to a counselor at a university about this kind of stuff or is that only for more serious situations?

2. If I can't continue at my university because I don't require classes there and can't major in what I want but application deadlines have passed for other universities, can I take the fall semester off, work, and apply for another university in that time, or should I take random classes at a CC to help me reach the 150 credits for the CPA, or what can I realistically do to not hurt myself and stay on track for getting my Bachelors in Accounting?",college,Personal help on campus and help on a Major?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/46btwp/personal_help_on_campus_and_help_on_a_major/,1455771199.0
51,unsureaboutmydegree,1422134685,/r/college/comments/2tjsrc/junior_almost_senior_student_looking_to_transfer/,"Hi everyone, so I'm currently a Biochemistry major at a small private school in California. I'm looking to transfer to a school that offers Chemical engineering. 

First, my grades:
 My grades started off bad but I started bringing them up (a lot of various external factors attributed to my low GPA. for one, I felt like I did not belong at my current university since I am a minority in a school 60% white affluent students, but that's another story.) I currently have a 2.33 (I was on academic probation for a semester because my semester GPA dropped to a 1.79, but the next semester i got a 2.69, which isn't the best but it was the highest GPA I've had in college and I was taking Upper division chem classes along with other physics and bio classes).  I know my GPA will limit me from transferring for sure.

I wasnt going to return to my university when I finished my first semester freshman year, but my parents encouraged me to do so. Even then I didn't want to return for sophomore year, but I rationalized that it woud be better to go and take classes that would probably be too difficult to get into at my local CC. Then my GPA dropped sophomore spring (i started rowing with hopes of possibly getting a scholarship and meeting people, boy i was wrong) to below a 2.0, so transferring was out of the picture.
So now I'm here, at a private school that I dont really like. People ask me how I like it and I was go ""well..... not really"". Why am I still here? Why did I think it would be a good idea to stay here?
 
Now my major:
I don't necessarily like biochemistry (proteins and such don't interest me) but my adviser insisted on me staying with biochemistry due to job prospects. I started doing research in a biochem lab but then switched into an organometallic/bioinorganic lab that focuses on catalysts. I wanted to take thermodynamics (pchem) but it is a class for chemistry majors. Although I am able to register for it, I will not be able to take the class that is the equivalent for biochem majors (which isn't really in my interest and my adviser is also against me taking it until i take a biochemistry class). A lot of the major classes are changing (so the class that was previously thermo will be changed to suit both chem and biochem majors.) Even if I did register for for thermo, I wouldnt be able to retake the class once it changed to satisfy my requirements for the biochemistry major. I really wont have a clue if I like thermodynamics or anythign related to chemical engineering. I feel like I would rather work as a Chemical Engineer in a plant rather than being a lab tech. I would talk to my adviser about this but she really just wants me to finish my degree and bounce. The thing is the job prospects for a BA (not even a BSc) in Biochemistry/chemistry are low and very competitive. I'm not sure what to anymore. 

Should I even consider transferring? I should also mention that by the time I graduate I will be around 40K in debt (i used to think it wasnt so bad since the starting salary for a biochem/chem major it USED to be 40K) . Or should I just suck it up and graduate? I could graduate with a BA in biochem and then do graduate school for Chemical Engineering but the thing goes back to my GPA and paying off my loans.

Any advice/comments/criticism would be greatly appreciated.",college,"Junior (almost Senior) student looking to transfer, but there are some setbacks....",http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2tjsrc/junior_almost_senior_student_looking_to_transfer/,1422152685.0

I would like to know what you all think about this, and whether I am out of line to demand action in response to what occurred.

----

This past semester has been tough both academically and emotionally for me. In May, I was put on academic probation due to my grades. Because of this, I was clinically diagnosed with severe depression. After dealing with depression of that aftermath, I didn't do so hot this semester either. I struggled getting to class on time due to often forgetting materials for class (and having a class directly before). I am also in the process of getting tested for ADHD (which I would like assistance in finding treatment for), as I feel it is directly responsible for a lot of my grades in addition to a few other things...

For the past few weeks, I assumed I was doing fine in my classes as grades were not posted. I was completely unaware until this week when grades were posted, I was in jeopardy of being dropped by the school following academic probation. One class I know I will most likely have to retake, but a second would cause me to be dropped by (School) and sit out a semester. I was in jeopardy in two electives. I wish I could turn around time, but I cannot. Coming to grips with what happened, I set up an appointment with each professor to be followed with an appointment with my advisor to assess damage control. After talking to my first instructor who excused my absences due to family emergencies, was more than willing to sit down with me this week and discuss potential point opportunities. (XXXXX Teacher, bless her heart)

Following, I attended my second class (the other elective, XXX200), and following the last class of the semester (last day of class no final for this elective), I asked to speak privately with the professor. I calmly explained my situation, asking if there was anyway possible that I could have two excused absences. (the professors policy is -100 points each class after two absences, and the class is out of 1000; also using ""electronic devices"" is counted as a full absence"". At the beginning of the semester, I bought a tablet to use to take notes (ONLY). I was told it would be okay for use in class as long as I took only notes. 

Further, I missed two classes due to having due to visiting my dieing grandmother who is on her death bed dieing of lung cancer, and visiting her before each of her surgeries (she is the only relative I have left from that generation). Unfortunately, I did not report this officially as it wasn't in exact line with the University's grievance policy and further didn't think two absences would effect me. (This also caused me to miss being able to turn in a 100pt paper... further tanking my grade). After reviewing the syllabus, it said he would try to make adjustments in the case of a Family or Medical emergency (which it was), and all I was asking for was some kind of opportunity to receive enough credit to boost my grade enough to get a D- (enough to not be dropped by the University).

While calmly explaining this to my professor, he said one of the most hurtful things I have ever heard. He told me I was ""quite immature"" and not paying attention in class and on my tablet (when I was in fact taking notes and have them to prove). He further said and I quote: ""maybe you do not deserve a degree here at (University)"". I immediately turned around and left in tears. Never IN MY LIFE have I been so disgusted to trust my education to a faculty that takes my money and disrespects me in my face because of my learning style. I feel robbed, but yet I don't know if I can put total blame on him. Is he right to fail me due to the way I take notes and disregarding a life I have outside of my academics? For once in my life, I question whether I belong here as a (School Mascot). I feel this is in DIRECT violation of the Student Bill of Rights (Article XX). 

I plan on sending this incident report to multiple people with hopes of getting some kind of action regarding this. I have already sent it to our school president as well. Am I wrong?

53,IdkwtS,1398394915,/r/college/comments/23x5t5/algrebra/,"Okay, um. I'm a high school senior close to graduating in a few months. My favorite subject is math but it's the subject I feel I'm most lacking in. I took Algebra 1 in 8th grade and it was fairly difficult to me due to both me not understanding it and my lazy nature. I got placed into Pre-Geometry in 9th (because the actual Geo class was too full) so I basically took a year 'preparing' for Geometry. 10th grade came and I was placed in Geometry and I flew through the course with the same lazy nature I had but everything just clicked when it came to Geo. 11th, I was placed into Algebra 2 / Trigonometry and this time, I was placed into the class a few weeks after the year started. So I hadn't done algebra in 3 years basically and I was behind everyone else. I struggled through Algebra 2 not understanding many things (and still don't) but when the Trig semester came, I flew through it like I did with Geo. I came to the conclusion I'm better with Geo and Trig but Algebra gives me a harder time. I tried going online for some help on math websites and I understood SOME stuff I didn't before but still some stuff did not stick. 

Now the question is, should I work on refining these skills in preparation for college? Will all of them be necessary right off the bat in my first year or will they sort of review it (which could help me understand more)? I know this is probably a weird question but any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

And I apologize if this really doesn't belong here.",college,Algrebra,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/23x5t5/algrebra/,1398412915.0

My parents are so damn proud of me. That's all a kid could ever want, right? They're proud because I'm the first in my family to actually go to college. They tell me that I'm brave to come this far, how proud they are, etc. They almost make it sound like I'm going to be some successful billionaire when I get out of college. I mean, I'm sure they don't actually expect that, but that's the way they make it sound, they're so damn proud. They were sad to realize that I'd have to live in the dorms, since the campus is an hour from where I live, and I can't drive. They'd constantly ask when I'd like to come home, if I'd like to come home every weekend or every month, etc.

Anyway, once I had all my things moved in, I was still sort of happy about my situation. ""I'm an adult now,"" I thought. ""I'm going to college, and I'm going to make it."" Once classes started, I was excited to finally be learning Japanese. I liked all my teachers, and my classes were alright. In fact, things were better than I thought they'd be. I kept hearing from college kids about how swamped with work they are, but I'm still not seeing that part. I have way too much time after classes are over. All my classes, last semester and now, get out before noon, leaving the whole day open. It's very boring. Yeah, I thought it was a pretty sweet deal starting out, but realized it was more boring than anything. I'm grateful to have all this freetime, but it doesn't really matter when there's absolutely nothing to do. Unfortunately, Earlham campus is located in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing here but a high school, some houses, and a Marsh down the street. All the stuff to do is in the next town over, Centerville, but I can't do anything about it, because like I said, I can't drive because I don't have a car or a license. I also don't have any friends. I made a couple during freshman orientation, but it's hard to maintain friendships with people who have completely different schedules than you. One girl I made friends with was an RA, and the other was a freshman like me. The RA girl is understandable; she's too busy herding a bunch of freshman in the dorms to deal with me, plus she's got classes. The freshman girl just disappeared after orientation. I had her number, and while I texted her a couple times, she never really went out of her way to text me, which gives me the impression that she's not really interested. (She recently just joined one of my seminars, but we don't really talk.)

I could just make new friends, but I feel like it's too late. Everyone's got their own cliques now, while I'm just here, being socially awkward. It's just not in my shy nature to jump into someone's conversation and make it seem like I belong there. Not to say that I'm completely closed off, either. I talk to my teachers sometimes, and sometimes I talk to a couple of kids in my classes and the girls in my dorm room, but I wouldn't call them my friends. Honestly, it doesn't really bother me that I don't have friends. Sometimes I think I would be less bored if I did have friends, and while that's true, I'm not completely torn up over the fact. Besides, I regularly keep in contact with my friends from back home over Facebook and such, so I'm not lonely or anything.

Then there was the problem with going home. When I first started out, my parents would pick me up every weekend to go home. It was nice, considering how uncomfortable with college I was already starting to feel. I felt that I needed something to do during the weekdays, so I signed up for the Japanese Culture Club, which I later found out was Anime Club II. Before I learned that, though, I wanted the meetings to be on the weekdays, so I’d have something to do at school. I could just go home on the weekends to have something to do on the weekends. Well, for some reason, my parents did a complete 180 and strictly forbade me from ever coming home until vacations started. It was jarring to say the least. I was already unsure about myself and my situation and this just threw things completely off rails for me. It confused me how they could go from wanting me home every weekend to not at all. I asked my mom about it and she said, “Well your father and I have been talking about it and we feel like you’re using home to run away from college. Plus, you’re missing out on the experience.” What fucking experience? The experience of being constantly stressed and questioning every choice I made in my life so far? Because I already experienced that. I didn’t use home as a place to run away to. I used it as a way to see my friends from home and be by myself when I wanted. Something I didn’t have at the time. I cried on the phone with my mom because she just wouldn’t listen. I explained to her why I liked coming home so much, but she didn’t budge. I didn’t talk to her for about a week or so after that. I was mad at her. I still am a little bitter about it. I thought that they just didn’t want me around; that they didn’t want to waste the gas, and no amount of convincing could persuade me otherwise. It made me feel worthless. Eventually, they let up and let me come home every other weekend. I know now that it wasn’t that they wanted me gone. I know they mean well, it’s just that they don’t have a very good way of showing it. At least, to me. Now I’m starting to feel uncomfortable at home. Yeah, it’s fine for the first day, but then I feel estranged somehow. Maybe it’s because my family’s fallen into a schedule without me. Because of this, I’m barely at home, and over at a friend’s house. I think I should get an apartment.",college,My Very Long Story: Seeking Advice Part 2,http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1vyx7d/my_very_long_story_seeking_advice_part_2/,1390526722.0
