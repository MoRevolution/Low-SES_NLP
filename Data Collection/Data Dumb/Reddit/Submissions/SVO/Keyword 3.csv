I am in my third semester and I live in an Asian country(I know Americans might not be the best to help because you are not aware of my societal and cultural settings but still any advice is appreciated because no one around me understands my situation).  So, here's the story: I am currently pursuing a BA(Honors) in Applied Psychology. Here, BA is a 3-year course. I am in one of the most reputed universities in  my country and I was one of the topper in high school so I had to work pretty hard to get here because the admissions are given on merit base and the cut-off is very high due to so much competition. So, I worked hard and got here.  
But the thing is, I have been wanting to drop out from this college. I  have lived a sheltered life as a kid and  I grew up in an abusive environment (my  father was an  alcoholic  and used to beat us up  when drunk). Long story short, I failed to make a transition from high school to college because I have never had any good  experiences and I have developed anxiety and depression to some extent(not diagnosed yet). So, I skipped a lot  of classes during my semester 1 but my real problems started in semester 2. I didn't go a single day for an entire semester and went straight to practicals examination and my teachers(3-4 of  them) yelled the hell out and gave me another mental  trauma. Then I became even more scared and when third semester started, I became extremely hopeless, I started dreading going to the lab and it didn't help that I missed two straight weeks initially so my professors have been throwing taunts at me since third semester and now I have a very low self esteem and my professors thinks I am an unreliable pathetic loser who doesn't deserve to be in this course anymore.  I  feel so trapped now. I am trapped in my mind. My parents have told me to  not even think  about dropping out but I can't take their(professors) insults anymore. My mother has suggested that she can come and talk to them but I am 19 and since I have been 14-15 I have been sort of alone in my battles  because my father was such a reckless and careless person and my brother used to make fun of me in everything. So, it  feels weird  that I am  officially an adult now and would need my mum to talk to my professors. I  would like to handle it all by myself. I am just so unmotivated to finish  the degree. I want to change my path and change my major but...I am in a huge dilemma because dropping out is never an option for my parents. I need some advice.  Also, a great point to be noted is I am in no debt and university fees is pretty low so I am not in a huge financial trouble or accumulated any debt.  
TL;DR: I feel like I am in depression. I can't tolerate college anymore. My parents won't allow me to drop out. I feel trapped. I sometimes think about suicide too. Need some advice.",college,Trouble with college?,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5c8pxz/trouble_with_college/,1478813234.0
