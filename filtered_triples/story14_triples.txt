I especially moved go to school 
I felt especially since I moved 
I especially moved away home 
I was only person in addition 
I was in debt 
school was predominately affluent 
me make friends 
socioeconomic differences made it hard 
me connect to others 
it hard for me to connect 
imposter syndrome led change 
me change my lifestyle 
me question my identity 
me change for worse to try 
I had depression at_time whole time 
i was in nightmare 
I felt in like nightmare 
it be isolated 
it sucks isolated 
I would wish upon anybody
