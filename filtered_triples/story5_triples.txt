I still get surprised 
I buy things for myself 
I want something for it 
I purchase non-essential items 
I experience guilt after purchase 
I experience weird guilt 
I purchase items within even though fully my budget 
I am solidly upper middle class 
I live in home in area 
I have in my house 
I have food in my house 
I live on tea 
I 'll go hungry 
I live for days 
my tail tried to make 
my tail tried to make in my early 20s 
I was working at_time 4 AM 
I could go to class 
I could go from 1 to 8 
I probably qualified for assistance
